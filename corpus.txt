About Chemistry 2e
Chemistry 2e is designed to meet the scope and sequence requirements of the two-semester general chemistry
course. The textbook provides an important opportunity for students to learn the core concepts of chemistry and
understand how those concepts apply to their lives and the world around them. The book also includes a number of
innovative features, including interactive exercises and real-world applications, designed to enhance student learning.
The second edition has been revised to incorporate clearer, more current, and more dynamic explanations, while
maintaining the same organization as the first edition. Substantial improvements have been made in the figures,
illustrations, and example exercises that support the text narrative.
Coverage and scope
Our Chemistry 2e textbook adheres to the scope and sequence of most general chemistry courses nationwide. We
strive to make chemistry, as a discipline, interesting and accessible to students. With this objective in mind, the
Preface 1
content of this textbook has been developed and arranged to provide a logical progression from fundamental to
more advanced concepts of chemical science. Topics are introduced within the context of familiar experiences
whenever possible, treated with an appropriate rigor to satisfy the intellect of the learner, and reinforced in subsequent
discussions of related content. The organization and pedagogical features were developed and vetted with feedback
from chemistry educators dedicated to the project.
Changes to the second edition
OpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case of
Chemistry 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in the
following ways:
Content revisions for clarity and accuracy. The revision plan varied by chapter based on need. About five chapters
were extensively rewritten and another twelve chapters were substantially revised to improve the readability and
clarity of the narrative.
Example and end-of-chapter exercises. The example and end-of-chapter exercises in several chapters were
subjected to a rigorous accuracy check and revised to correct any errors, and additional exercises were added to
several chapters to more fully support chapter content.
Art and illustrations. Under the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well-
versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes to much of the art in the first edition of Chemistry.
The revisions included correcting errors, redesigning illustrations to improve understanding, and recoloring for
overall consistency.
Accessibility improvements. As with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Chemistry was created with a focus
on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. To accommodate users
of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.
Many illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students.
Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.
Pedagogical foundation and features
Throughout Chemistry 2e, you will find features that draw the students into scientific inquiry by taking selected topics
a step further. Students and educators alike will appreciate discussions in these feature boxes.
Chemistry in Everyday Life ties chemistry concepts to everyday issues and real-world applications of
science that students encounter in their lives. Topics include cell phones, solar thermal energy power plants,
plastics recycling, and measuring blood pressure.
How Sciences Interconnect feature boxes discuss chemistry in context of its interconnectedness with other
scientific disciplines. Topics include neurotransmitters, greenhouse gases and climate change, and proteins
and enzymes.
Portrait of a Chemist presents a short bio and an introduction to the work of prominent figures from history
and present day so that students can see the “faces” of contributors in this field as well as science in action.
Comprehensive art program
Our art program is designed to enhance students’ understanding of concepts through clear, effective illustrations,
diagrams, and photographs.

Introduction
Your alarm goes off and, after hitting “snooze” once or twice, you pry yourself out of bed. You make a cup of coffee
to help you get going, and then you shower, get dressed, eat breakfast, and check your phone for messages. On your
way to school, you stop to fill your car’s gas tank, almost making you late for the first day of chemistry class. As you
find a seat in the classroom, you read the question projected on the screen: “Welcome to class! Why should we study
chemistry?”
Do you have an answer? You may be studying chemistry because it fulfills an academic requirement, but if you
consider your daily activities, you might find chemistry interesting for other reasons. Most everything you do and
encounter during your day involves chemistry. Making coffee, cooking eggs, and toasting bread involve chemistry.
The products you use—like soap and shampoo, the fabrics you wear, the electronics that keep you connected to your
world, the gasoline that propels your car—all of these and more involve chemical substances and processes. Whether
you are aware or not, chemistry is part of your everyday world. In this course, you will learn many of the essential
principles underlying the chemistry of modern-day life.
Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 9
1.1 Chemistry in Context
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
• Outline the historical development of chemistry
• Provide examples of the importance of chemistry in everyday life
• Describe the scientific method
• Differentiate among hypotheses, theories, and laws
• Provide examples illustrating macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic domains
Throughout human history, people have tried to convert matter into more useful forms. Our Stone Age ancestors
chipped pieces of flint into useful tools and carved wood into statues and toys. These endeavors involved changing the
shape of a substance without changing the substance itself. But as our knowledge increased, humans began to change
the composition of the substances as well—clay was converted into pottery, hides were cured to make garments,
copper ores were transformed into copper tools and weapons, and grain was made into bread.
Humans began to practice chemistry when they learned to control fire and use it to cook, make pottery, and smelt
metals. Subsequently, they began to separate and use specific components of matter. A variety of drugs such as aloe,
myrrh, and opium were isolated from plants. Dyes, such as indigo and Tyrian purple, were extracted from plant and
animal matter. Metals were combined to form alloys—for example, copper and tin were mixed together to make
bronze—and more elaborate smelting techniques produced iron. Alkalis were extracted from ashes, and soaps were
prepared by combining these alkalis with fats. Alcohol was produced by fermentation and purified by distillation.
Attempts to understand the behavior of matter extend back for more than 2500 years. As early as the sixth century
BC, Greek philosophers discussed a system in which water was the basis of all things. You may have heard of the
Greek postulate that matter consists of four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. Subsequently, an amalgamation of
chemical technologies and philosophical speculations was spread from Egypt, China, and the eastern Mediterranean
by alchemists, who endeavored to transform “base metals” such as lead into “noble metals” like gold, and to create
elixirs to cure disease and extend life (Figure 1.2).

contributions to how to manipulate matter, it was not scientific by modern standards. (credit: Chemical Heritage
Foundation)
From alchemy came the historical progressions that led to modern chemistry: the isolation of drugs from natural
sources, metallurgy, and the dye industry. Today, chemistry continues to deepen our understanding and improve our
ability to harness and control the behavior of matter.
Chemistry: The Central Science
Chemistry is sometimes referred to as “the central science” due to its interconnectedness with a vast array of
other STEM disciplines (STEM stands for areas of study in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields).
Chemistry and the language of chemists play vital roles in biology, medicine, materials science, forensics,
environmental science, and many other fields (Figure 1.3). The basic principles of physics are essential for
understanding many aspects of chemistry, and there is extensive overlap between many subdisciplines within the
two fields, such as chemical physics and nuclear chemistry. Mathematics, computer science, and information theory
provide important tools that help us calculate, interpret, describe, and generally make sense of the chemical world.
Biology and chemistry converge in biochemistry, which is crucial to understanding the many complex factors and
processes that keep living organisms (such as us) alive. Chemical engineering, materials science, and nanotechnology
combine chemical principles and empirical findings to produce useful substances, ranging from gasoline to fabrics to
electronics. Agriculture, food science, veterinary science, and brewing and wine making help provide sustenance in
the form of food and drink to the world’s population. Medicine, pharmacology, biotechnology, and botany identify
and produce substances that help keep us healthy. Environmental science, geology, oceanography, and atmospheric
science incorporate many chemical ideas to help us better understand and protect our physical world. Chemical ideas
are used to help understand the universe in astronomy and cosmology.
Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 11
Figure 1.3 Knowledge of chemistry is central to understanding a wide range of scientific disciplines. This diagram
shows just some of the interrelationships between chemistry and other fields.
What are some changes in matter that are essential to daily life? Digesting and assimilating food, synthesizing
polymers that are used to make clothing, containers, cookware, and credit cards, and refining crude oil into gasoline
and other products are just a few examples. As you proceed through this course, you will discover many different
examples of changes in the composition and structure of matter, how to classify these changes and how they occurred,
their causes, the changes in energy that accompany them, and the principles and laws involved. As you learn about
these things, you will be learning chemistry, the study of the composition, properties, and interactions of matter. The
practice of chemistry is not limited to chemistry books or laboratories: It happens whenever someone is involved in
changes in matter or in conditions that may lead to such changes.
The Scientific Method
Chemistry is a science based on observation and experimentation. Doing chemistry involves attempting to answer
questions and explain observations in terms of the laws and theories of chemistry, using procedures that are accepted
by the scientific community. There is no single route to answering a question or explaining an observation, but
there is an aspect common to every approach: Each uses knowledge based on experiments that can be reproduced to
verify the results. Some routes involve a hypothesis, a tentative explanation of observations that acts as a guide for
gathering and checking information. A hypothesis is tested by experimentation, calculation, and/or comparison with
the experiments of others and then refined as needed.
Some hypotheses are attempts to explain the behavior that is summarized in laws. The laws of science summarize
a vast number of experimental observations, and describe or predict some facet of the natural world. If such a
hypothesis turns out to be capable of explaining a large body of experimental data, it can reach the status of a
theory. Scientific theories are well-substantiated, comprehensive, testable explanations of particular aspects of nature.
Theories are accepted because they provide satisfactory explanations, but they can be modified if new data become
available. The path of discovery that leads from question and observation to law or hypothesis to theory, combined
with experimental verification of the hypothesis and any necessary modification of the theory, is called the scientific
method (Figure 1.4).

Figure 1.4 The scientific method follows a process similar to the one shown in this diagram. All the key components
are shown, in roughly the right order. Scientific progress is seldom neat and clean: It requires open inquiry and the
reworking of questions and ideas in response to findings.
The Domains of Chemistry
Chemists study and describe the behavior of matter and energy in three different domains: macroscopic, microscopic,
and symbolic. These domains provide different ways of considering and describing chemical behavior.
Macro is a Greek word that means “large.” The macroscopic domain is familiar to us: It is the realm of everyday
things that are large enough to be sensed directly by human sight or touch. In daily life, this includes the food you eat
and the breeze you feel on your face. The macroscopic domain includes everyday and laboratory chemistry, where we
observe and measure physical and chemical properties such as density, solubility, and flammability.
Micro comes from Greek and means “small.” The microscopic domain of chemistry is often visited in the
imagination. Some aspects of the microscopic domain are visible through standard optical microscopes, for example,
many biological cells. More sophisticated instruments are capable of imaging even smaller entities such as molecules
and atoms (see Figure 1.5 (b)).
However, most of the subjects in the microscopic domain of chemistry are too small to be seen even with the most
advanced microscopes and may only be pictured in the mind. Other components of the microscopic domain include
ions and electrons, protons and neutrons, and chemical bonds, each of which is far too small to see.
The symbolic domain contains the specialized language used to represent components of the macroscopic and
microscopic domains. Chemical symbols (such as those used in the periodic table), chemical formulas, and chemical
equations are part of the symbolic domain, as are graphs, drawings, and calculations. These symbols play an important
role in chemistry because they help interpret the behavior of the macroscopic domain in terms of the components of
the microscopic domain. One of the challenges for students learning chemistry is recognizing that the same symbols
can represent different things in the macroscopic and microscopic domains, and one of the features that makes
chemistry fascinating is the use of a domain that must be imagined to explain behavior in a domain that can be
observed.
Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 13
A helpful way to understand the three domains is via the essential and ubiquitous substance of water. That water is
a liquid at moderate temperatures, will freeze to form a solid at lower temperatures, and boil to form a gas at higher
temperatures (Figure 1.5) are macroscopic observations. But some properties of water fall into the microscopic
domain—what cannot be observed with the naked eye. The description of water as comprising two hydrogen atoms
and one oxygen atom, and the explanation of freezing and boiling in terms of attractions between these molecules, is
within the microscopic arena. The formula H2O, which can describe water at either the macroscopic or microscopic
levels, is an example of the symbolic domain. The abbreviations (g) for gas, (s) for solid, and (l) for liquid are also
symbolic.
Figure 1.5 (a) Moisture in the air, icebergs, and the ocean represent water in the macroscopic domain. (b) At the
molecular level (microscopic domain), gas molecules are far apart and disorganized, solid water molecules are close
together and organized, and liquid molecules are close together and disorganized. (c) The formula H2O symbolizes
water, and (g), (s), and (l) symbolize its phases. Note that clouds actually comprise either very small liquid water
droplets or solid water crystals; gaseous water in our atmosphere is not visible to the naked eye, although it may be
sensed as humidity. (credit a: modification of work by “Gorkaazk”/Wikimedia Commons)
1.2 Phases and Classification of Matter
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the basic properties of each physical state of matter: solid, liquid, and gas
• Distinguish between mass and weight
• Apply the law of conservation of matter
• Classify matter as an element, compound, homogeneous mixture, or heterogeneous mixture with regard to its
physical state and composition
• Define and give examples of atoms and molecules
Matter is defined as anything that occupies space and has mass, and it is all around us. Solids and liquids are more
obviously matter: We can see that they take up space, and their weight tells us that they have mass. Gases are also
14 Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
matter; if gases did not take up space, a balloon would not inflate (increase its volume) when filled with gas.
Solids, liquids, and gases are the three states of matter commonly found on earth (Figure 1.6). A solid is rigid and
possesses a definite shape. A liquid flows and takes the shape of its container, except that it forms a flat or slightly
curved upper surface when acted upon by gravity. (In zero gravity, liquids assume a spherical shape.) Both liquid and
solid samples have volumes that are very nearly independent of pressure. A gas takes both the shape and volume of
its container.
Figure 1.6 The three most common states or phases of matter are solid, liquid, and gas.
A fourth state of matter, plasma, occurs naturally in the interiors of stars. A plasma is a gaseous state of matter that
contains appreciable numbers of electrically charged particles (Figure 1.7). The presence of these charged particles
imparts unique properties to plasmas that justify their classification as a state of matter distinct from gases. In addition
to stars, plasmas are found in some other high-temperature environments (both natural and man-made), such as
lightning strikes, certain television screens, and specialized analytical instruments used to detect trace amounts of
metals.
Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 15
Figure 1.7 A plasma torch can be used to cut metal. (credit: “Hypertherm”/Wikimedia Commons)
In a tiny cell in a plasma television, the plasma emits ultraviolet light, which in turn causes the display at
that location to appear a specific color. The composite of these tiny dots of color makes up the image that
you see. Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16plasma) to learn more about plasma and the
places you encounter it.
Some samples of matter appear to have properties of solids, liquids, and/or gases at the same time. This can occur
when the sample is composed of many small pieces. For example, we can pour sand as if it were a liquid because it
is composed of many small grains of solid sand. Matter can also have properties of more than one state when it is a
mixture, such as with clouds. Clouds appear to behave somewhat like gases, but they are actually mixtures of air (gas)
and tiny particles of water (liquid or solid).
The mass of an object is a measure of the amount of matter in it. One way to measure an object’s mass is to measure
the force it takes to accelerate the object. It takes much more force to accelerate a car than a bicycle because the car
has much more mass. A more common way to determine the mass of an object is to use a balance to compare its mass
with a standard mass.
Although weight is related to mass, it is not the same thing. Weight refers to the force that gravity exerts on an object.
This force is directly proportional to the mass of the object. The weight of an object changes as the force of gravity
changes, but its mass does not. An astronaut’s mass does not change just because she goes to the moon. But her
weight on the moon is only one-sixth her earth-bound weight because the moon’s gravity is only one-sixth that of the
earth’s. She may feel “weightless” during her trip when she experiences negligible external forces (gravitational or
any other), although she is, of course, never “massless.”
The law of conservation of matter summarizes many scientific observations about matter: It states that there is no
detectable change in the total quantity of matter present when matter converts from one type to another (a chemical
change) or changes among solid, liquid, or gaseous states (a physical change). Brewing beer and the operation of
batteries provide examples of the conservation of matter (Figure 1.8). During the brewing of beer, the ingredients
(water, yeast, grains, malt, hops, and sugar) are converted into beer (water, alcohol, carbonation, and flavoring
substances) with no actual loss of substance. This is most clearly seen during the bottling process, when glucose turns
into ethanol and carbon dioxide, and the total mass of the substances does not change. This can also be seen in a

lead-acid car battery: The original substances (lead, lead oxide, and sulfuric acid), which are capable of producing
electricity, are changed into other substances (lead sulfate and water) that do not produce electricity, with no change
in the actual amount of matter.
Figure 1.8 (a) The mass of beer precursor materials is the same as the mass of beer produced: Sugar has become
alcohol and carbon dioxide. (b) The mass of the lead, lead oxide, and sulfuric acid consumed by the production of
electricity is exactly equal to the mass of lead sulfate and water that is formed.
Although this conservation law holds true for all conversions of matter, convincing examples are few and far between
because, outside of the controlled conditions in a laboratory, we seldom collect all of the material that is produced
during a particular conversion. For example, when you eat, digest, and assimilate food, all of the matter in the original
food is preserved. But because some of the matter is incorporated into your body, and much is excreted as various
types of waste, it is challenging to verify by measurement.
Classifying Matter
Matter can be classified into several categories. Two broad categories are mixtures and pure substances. A pure
substance has a constant composition. All specimens of a pure substance have exactly the same makeup and
properties. Any sample of sucrose (table sugar) consists of 42.1% carbon, 6.5% hydrogen, and 51.4% oxygen by
mass. Any sample of sucrose also has the same physical properties, such as melting point, color, and sweetness,
regardless of the source from which it is isolated.
Pure substances may be divided into two classes: elements and compounds. Pure substances that cannot be broken
down into simpler substances by chemical changes are called elements. Iron, silver, gold, aluminum, sulfur, oxygen,
and copper are familiar examples of the more than 100 known elements, of which about 90 occur naturally on the
earth, and two dozen or so have been created in laboratories.
Pure substances that can be broken down by chemical changes are called compounds. This breakdown may produce
either elements or other compounds, or both. Mercury(II) oxide, an orange, crystalline solid, can be broken down by
heat into the elements mercury and oxygen (Figure 1.9). When heated in the absence of air, the compound sucrose
is broken down into the element carbon and the compound water. (The initial stage of this process, when the sugar is
turning brown, is known as caramelization—this is what imparts the characteristic sweet and nutty flavor to caramel
apples, caramelized onions, and caramel). Silver(I) chloride is a white solid that can be broken down into its elements,
silver and chlorine, by absorption of light. This property is the basis for the use of this compound in photographic
Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 17
films and photochromic eyeglasses (those with lenses that darken when exposed to light).
Figure 1.9 (a) The compound mercury(II) oxide, (b) when heated, (c) decomposes into silvery droplets of liquid
mercury and invisible oxygen gas. (credit: modification of work by Paul Flowers)
Many compounds break down when heated. This site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16mercury) shows
the breakdown of mercury oxide, HgO. You can also view an example of the photochemical
decomposition of silver chloride (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16silvchloride) (AgCl), the basis of
early photography.
The properties of combined elements are different from those in the free, or uncombined, state. For example, white
crystalline sugar (sucrose) is a compound resulting from the chemical combination of the element carbon, which is
a black solid in one of its uncombined forms, and the two elements hydrogen and oxygen, which are colorless gases
when uncombined. Free sodium, an element that is a soft, shiny, metallic solid, and free chlorine, an element that is a
yellow-green gas, combine to form sodium chloride (table salt), a compound that is a white, crystalline solid.
A mixture is composed of two or more types of matter that can be present in varying amounts and can be separated
by physical changes, such as evaporation (you will learn more about this later). A mixture with a composition that
varies from point to point is called a heterogeneous mixture. Italian dressing is an example of a heterogeneous
mixture (Figure 1.10). Its composition can vary because it may be prepared from varying amounts of oil, vinegar,
and herbs. It is not the same from point to point throughout the mixture—one drop may be mostly vinegar, whereas a
different drop may be mostly oil or herbs because the oil and vinegar separate and the herbs settle. Other examples of
heterogeneous mixtures are chocolate chip cookies (we can see the separate bits of chocolate, nuts, and cookie dough)
and granite (we can see the quartz, mica, feldspar, and more).
A homogeneous mixture, also called a solution, exhibits a uniform composition and appears visually the same
throughout. An example of a solution is a sports drink, consisting of water, sugar, coloring, flavoring, and electrolytes
mixed together uniformly (Figure 1.10). Each drop of a sports drink tastes the same because each drop contains
the same amounts of water, sugar, and other components. Note that the composition of a sports drink can vary—it
could be made with somewhat more or less sugar, flavoring, or other components, and still be a sports drink. Other
examples of homogeneous mixtures include air, maple syrup, gasoline, and a solution of salt in water.

Although there are just over 100 elements, tens of millions of chemical compounds result from different combinations
of these elements. Each compound has a specific composition and possesses definite chemical and physical properties
that distinguish it from all other compounds. And, of course, there are innumerable ways to combine elements and
compounds to form different mixtures. A summary of how to distinguish between the various major classifications of
matter is shown in (Figure 1.11).
Figure 1.11 Depending on its properties, a given substance can be classified as a homogeneous mixture, a
heterogeneous mixture, a compound, or an element.
Eleven elements make up about 99% of the earth’s crust and atmosphere (Table 1.1). Oxygen constitutes nearly one-
half and silicon about one-quarter of the total quantity of these elements. A majority of elements on earth are found
in chemical combinations with other elements; about one-quarter of the elements are also found in the free state.

Atoms and Molecules
An atom is the smallest particle of an element that has the properties of that element and can enter into a chemical
combination. Consider the element gold, for example. Imagine cutting a gold nugget in half, then cutting one of the
halves in half, and repeating this process until a piece of gold remained that was so small that it could not be cut
in half (regardless of how tiny your knife may be). This minimally sized piece of gold is an atom (from the Greek
atomos, meaning “indivisible”) (Figure 1.12). This atom would no longer be gold if it were divided any further.
Figure 1.12 (a) This photograph shows a gold nugget. (b) A scanning-tunneling microscope (STM) can generate
views of the surfaces of solids, such as this image of a gold crystal. Each sphere represents one gold atom. (credit a:

Commons)
The first suggestion that matter is composed of atoms is attributed to the Greek philosophers Leucippus and
Democritus, who developed their ideas in the 5th century BCE. However, it was not until the early nineteenth century
that John Dalton (1766–1844), a British schoolteacher with a keen interest in science, supported this hypothesis with
quantitative measurements. Since that time, repeated experiments have confirmed many aspects of this hypothesis,
and it has become one of the central theories of chemistry. Other aspects of Dalton’s atomic theory are still used but
with minor revisions (details of Dalton’s theory are provided in the chapter on atoms and molecules).

An atom is so small that its size is difficult to imagine. One of the smallest things we can see with our unaided eye is
a single thread of a spider web: These strands are about 1/10,000 of a centimeter (0.0001 cm) in diameter. Although
the cross-section of one strand is almost impossible to see without a microscope, it is huge on an atomic scale. A
single carbon atom in the web has a diameter of about 0.000000015 centimeter, and it would take about 7000 carbon
atoms to span the diameter of the strand. To put this in perspective, if a carbon atom were the size of a dime, the
cross-section of one strand would be larger than a football field, which would require about 150 million carbon atom
“dimes” to cover it. (Figure 1.13) shows increasingly close microscopic and atomic-level views of ordinary cotton.
Figure 1.13 These images provide an increasingly closer view: (a) a cotton boll, (b) a single cotton fiber viewed
under an optical microscope (magnified 40 times), (c) an image of a cotton fiber obtained with an electron microscope
(much higher magnification than with the optical microscope); and (d and e) atomic-level models of the fiber (spheres
of different colors represent atoms of different elements). (credit c: modification of work by “Featheredtar”/Wikimedia
Commons)
An atom is so light that its mass is also difficult to imagine. A billion lead atoms (1,000,000,000 atoms) weigh about
3 × 10−13 grams, a mass that is far too light to be weighed on even the world’s most sensitive balances. It would
require over 300,000,000,000,000 lead atoms (300 trillion, or 3 × 1014) to be weighed, and they would weigh only
0.0000001 gram.
It is rare to find collections of individual atoms. Only a few elements, such as the gases helium, neon, and argon,
consist of a collection of individual atoms that move about independently of one another. Other elements, such as the
gases hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and chlorine, are composed of units that consist of pairs of atoms (Figure 1.14).
One form of the element phosphorus consists of units composed of four phosphorus atoms. The element sulfur exists
in various forms, one of which consists of units composed of eight sulfur atoms. These units are called molecules. A
molecule consists of two or more atoms joined by strong forces called chemical bonds. The atoms in a molecule move
around as a unit, much like the cans of soda in a six-pack or a bunch of keys joined together on a single key ring. A
molecule may consist of two or more identical atoms, as in the molecules found in the elements hydrogen, oxygen,
and sulfur, or it may consist of two or more different atoms, as in the molecules found in water. Each water molecule
is a unit that contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Each glucose molecule is a unit that contains 6
carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms. Like atoms, molecules are incredibly small and light. If an
ordinary glass of water were enlarged to the size of the earth, the water molecules inside it would be about the size of
golf balls.

atoms of the same element. The compounds water, carbon dioxide, and glucose consist of combinations of atoms of
different elements.
Decomposition of Water / Production of Hydrogen
Water consists of the elements hydrogen and oxygen combined in a 2 to 1 ratio. Water can be broken down
into hydrogen and oxygen gases by the addition of energy. One way to do this is with a battery or power supply,
as shown in (Figure 1.15).
Chemistry in Everyday Life

Figure 1.15 The decomposition of water is shown at the macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic levels.
The battery provides an electric current (microscopic) that decomposes water. At the macroscopic level, the
liquid separates into the gases hydrogen (on the left) and oxygen (on the right). Symbolically, this change is
presented by showing how liquid H2O separates into H2 and O2 gases.
The breakdown of water involves a rearrangement of the atoms in water molecules into different molecules,
each composed of two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms, respectively. Two water molecules form
one oxygen molecule and two hydrogen molecules. The representation for what occurs,
2H2 O(l) ⟶ 2H2(g) + O2(g), will be explored in more depth in later chapters.
The two gases produced have distinctly different properties. Oxygen is not flammable but is required for
combustion of a fuel, and hydrogen is highly flammable and a potent energy source. How might this knowledge
be applied in our world? One application involves research into more fuel-efficient transportation. Fuel-cell
vehicles (FCV) run on hydrogen instead of gasoline (Figure 1.16). They are more efficient than vehicles
with internal combustion engines, are nonpolluting, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, making us less
dependent on fossil fuels. FCVs are not yet economically viable, however, and current hydrogen production
depends on natural gas. If we can develop a process to economically decompose water, or produce hydrogen
in another environmentally sound way, FCVs may be the way of the future.

Chemistry of Cell Phones
Imagine how different your life would be without cell phones (Figure 1.17) and other smart devices. Cell
phones are made from numerous chemical substances, which are extracted, refined, purified, and assembled
using an extensive and in-depth understanding of chemical principles. About 30% of the elements that are
found in nature are found within a typical smart phone. The case/body/frame consists of a combination
of sturdy, durable polymers composed primarily of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen [acrylonitrile
butadiene styrene (ABS) and polycarbonate thermoplastics], and light, strong, structural metals, such as
aluminum, magnesium, and iron. The display screen is made from a specially toughened glass (silica glass
strengthened by the addition of aluminum, sodium, and potassium) and coated with a material to make it
conductive (such as indium tin oxide). The circuit board uses a semiconductor material (usually silicon);
commonly used metals like copper, tin, silver, and gold; and more unfamiliar elements such as yttrium,
praseodymium, and gadolinium. The battery relies upon lithium ions and a variety of other materials, including
iron, cobalt, copper, polyethylene oxide, and polyacrylonitrile.

1.3 Physical and Chemical Properties
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Identify properties of and changes in matter as physical or chemical
• Identify properties of matter as extensive or intensive
The characteristics that distinguish one substance from another are called properties. A physical property is a
characteristic of matter that is not associated with a change in its chemical composition. Familiar examples of physical
properties include density, color, hardness, melting and boiling points, and electrical conductivity. Some physical
properties, such as density and color, may be observed without changing the physical state of the matter. Other
physical properties, such as the melting temperature of iron or the freezing temperature of water, can only be observed
as matter undergoes a physical change. A physical change is a change in the state or properties of matter without
any accompanying change in the chemical identities of the substances contained in the matter. Physical changes are
observed when wax melts, when sugar dissolves in coffee, and when steam condenses into liquid water (Figure
1.18). Other examples of physical changes include magnetizing and demagnetizing metals (as is done with common
antitheft security tags) and grinding solids into powders (which can sometimes yield noticeable changes in color). In
each of these examples, there is a change in the physical state, form, or properties of the substance, but no change in
its chemical composition.
Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 25

condensing inside a cooking pot is a physical change, as water vapor is changed into liquid water. (credit a:

The change of one type of matter into another type (or the inability to change) is a chemical property. Examples
of chemical properties include flammability, toxicity, acidity, and many other types of reactivity. Iron, for example,
combines with oxygen in the presence of water to form rust; chromium does not oxidize (Figure 1.19). Nitroglycerin
is very dangerous because it explodes easily; neon poses almost no hazard because it is very unreactive.
Figure 1.19 (a) One of the chemical properties of iron is that it rusts; (b) one of the chemical properties of chromium
is that it does not. (credit a: modification of work by Tony Hisgett; credit b: modification of work by “Atoma”/Wikimedia
Commons)
A chemical change always produces one or more types of matter that differ from the matter present before the
change. The formation of rust is a chemical change because rust is a different kind of matter than the iron, oxygen, and
water present before the rust formed. The explosion of nitroglycerin is a chemical change because the gases produced
are very different kinds of matter from the original substance. Other examples of chemical changes include reactions
that are performed in a lab (such as copper reacting with nitric acid), all forms of combustion (burning), and food
being cooked, digested, or rotting (Figure 1.20).

changes, including the oxidation of iron in myoglobin that results in the familiar red-to-brown color change. (d) A
banana turning brown is a chemical change as new, darker (and less tasty) substances form. (credit b: modification of

Verzo)
Properties of matter fall into one of two categories. If the property depends on the amount of matter present, it is an
extensive property. The mass and volume of a substance are examples of extensive properties; for instance, a gallon
of milk has a larger mass than a cup of milk. The value of an extensive property is directly proportional to the amount
of matter in question. If the property of a sample of matter does not depend on the amount of matter present, it is
an intensive property. Temperature is an example of an intensive property. If the gallon and cup of milk are each at
20 °C (room temperature), when they are combined, the temperature remains at 20 °C. As another example, consider
the distinct but related properties of heat and temperature. A drop of hot cooking oil spattered on your arm causes
brief, minor discomfort, whereas a pot of hot oil yields severe burns. Both the drop and the pot of oil are at the same
temperature (an intensive property), but the pot clearly contains much more heat (extensive property).
Hazard Diamond
You may have seen the symbol shown in Figure 1.21 on containers of chemicals in a laboratory or workplace.
Sometimes called a “fire diamond” or “hazard diamond,” this chemical hazard diamond provides valuable
information that briefly summarizes the various dangers of which to be aware when working with a particular

substance.
Figure 1.21 The National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) hazard diamond summarizes the major hazards of
a chemical substance.
The National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) 704 Hazard Identification System was developed by NFPA to
provide safety information about certain substances. The system details flammability, reactivity, health, and
other hazards. Within the overall diamond symbol, the top (red) diamond specifies the level of fire hazard
(temperature range for flash point). The blue (left) diamond indicates the level of health hazard. The yellow
(right) diamond describes reactivity hazards, such as how readily the substance will undergo detonation or a
violent chemical change. The white (bottom) diamond points out special hazards, such as if it is an oxidizer
(which allows the substance to burn in the absence of air/oxygen), undergoes an unusual or dangerous
reaction with water, is corrosive, acidic, alkaline, a biological hazard, radioactive, and so on. Each hazard is
rated on a scale from 0 to 4, with 0 being no hazard and 4 being extremely hazardous.
While many elements differ dramatically in their chemical and physical properties, some elements have similar
properties. For example, many elements conduct heat and electricity well, whereas others are poor conductors.
These properties can be used to sort the elements into three classes: metals (elements that conduct well), nonmetals
(elements that conduct poorly), and metalloids (elements that have intermediate conductivities).
The periodic table is a table of elements that places elements with similar properties close together (Figure 1.22).
You will learn more about the periodic table as you continue your study of chemistry.

the background color denotes whether an element is a metal, metalloid, or nonmetal, whereas the element symbol

1.4 Measurements
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the process of measurement
• Identify the three basic parts of a quantity
• Describe the properties and units of length, mass, volume, density, temperature, and time
• Perform basic unit calculations and conversions in the metric and other unit systems
Measurements provide much of the information that informs the hypotheses, theories, and laws describing the
behavior of matter and energy in both the macroscopic and microscopic domains of chemistry. Every measurement
provides three kinds of information: the size or magnitude of the measurement (a number); a standard of comparison
for the measurement (a unit); and an indication of the uncertainty of the measurement. While the number and unit are
explicitly represented when a quantity is written, the uncertainty is an aspect of the measurement result that is more
implicitly represented and will be discussed later.
The number in the measurement can be represented in different ways, including decimal form and scientific notation.
Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 29
(Scientific notation is also known as exponential notation; a review of this topic can be found in Appendix B.)
For example, the maximum takeoff weight of a Boeing 777-200ER airliner is 298,000 kilograms, which can also be
written as 2.98 × 105 kg. The mass of the average mosquito is about 0.0000025 kilograms, which can be written as
2.5 × 10−6 kg.
Units, such as liters, pounds, and centimeters, are standards of comparison for measurements. A 2-liter bottle of a
soft drink contains a volume of beverage that is twice that of the accepted volume of 1 liter. The meat used to prepare
a 0.25-pound hamburger weighs one-fourth as much as the accepted weight of 1 pound. Without units, a number
can be meaningless, confusing, or possibly life threatening. Suppose a doctor prescribes phenobarbital to control a
patient’s seizures and states a dosage of “100” without specifying units. Not only will this be confusing to the medical
professional giving the dose, but the consequences can be dire: 100 mg given three times per day can be effective as
an anticonvulsant, but a single dose of 100 g is more than 10 times the lethal amount.
The measurement units for seven fundamental properties (“base units”) are listed in Table 1.2. The standards for
these units are fixed by international agreement, and they are called the International System of Units or SI Units
(from the French, Le Système International d’Unités). SI units have been used by the United States National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) since 1964. Units for other properties may be derived from these seven base
units.
Base Units of the SI System

Everyday measurement units are often defined as fractions or multiples of other units. Milk is commonly packaged
in containers of 1 gallon (4 quarts), 1 quart (0.25 gallon), and one pint (0.5 quart). This same approach is used with
SI units, but these fractions or multiples are always powers of 10. Fractional or multiple SI units are named using
a prefix and the name of the base unit. For example, a length of 1000 meters is also called a kilometer because the
prefix kilo means “one thousand,” which in scientific notation is 103 (1 kilometer = 1000 m = 103 m). The prefixes
used and the powers to which 10 are raised are listed in Table 1.3.

SI Base Units
The initial units of the metric system, which eventually evolved into the SI system, were established in France
during the French Revolution. The original standards for the meter and the kilogram were adopted there in 1799 and
eventually by other countries. This section introduces four of the SI base units commonly used in chemistry. Other SI
units will be introduced in subsequent chapters.
Length
The standard unit of length in both the SI and original metric systems is the meter (m). A meter was originally
specified as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the North Pole to the equator. It is now defined as the distance light
in a vacuum travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second. A meter is about 3 inches longer than a yard (Figure 1.23); one
meter is about 39.37 inches or 1.094 yards. Longer distances are often reported in kilometers (1 km = 1000 m = 103
m), whereas shorter distances can be reported in centimeters (1 cm = 0.01 m = 10−2 m) or millimeters (1 mm = 0.001
m = 10−3 m).

Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 31
Figure 1.23 The relative lengths of 1 m, 1 yd, 1 cm, and 1 in. are shown (not actual size), as well as comparisons of
2.54 cm and 1 in., and of 1 m and 1.094 yd.
Mass
The standard unit of mass in the SI system is the kilogram (kg). A kilogram was originally defined as the mass of
a liter of water (a cube of water with an edge length of exactly 0.1 meter). It is now defined by a certain cylinder of
platinum-iridium alloy, which is kept in France (Figure 1.24). Any object with the same mass as this cylinder is said
to have a mass of 1 kilogram. One kilogram is about 2.2 pounds. The gram (g) is exactly equal to 1/1000 of the mass
of the kilogram (10−3 kg).
Figure 1.24 This replica prototype kilogram is housed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
in Maryland. (credit: National Institutes of Standards and Technology)
Temperature
Temperature is an intensive property. The SI unit of temperature is the kelvin (K). The IUPAC convention is to use
kelvin (all lowercase) for the word, K (uppercase) for the unit symbol, and neither the word “degree” nor the degree
32 Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
symbol (°). The degree Celsius (°C) is also allowed in the SI system, with both the word “degree” and the degree
symbol used for Celsius measurements. Celsius degrees are the same magnitude as those of kelvin, but the two scales
place their zeros in different places. Water freezes at 273.15 K (0 °C) and boils at 373.15 K (100 °C) by definition,
and normal human body temperature is approximately 310 K (37 °C). The conversion between these two units and
the Fahrenheit scale will be discussed later in this chapter.
Time
The SI base unit of time is the second (s). Small and large time intervals can be expressed with the appropriate
prefixes; for example, 3 microseconds = 0.000003 s = 3 × 10−6 and 5 megaseconds = 5,000,000 s = 5 × 106 s.
Alternatively, hours, days, and years can be used.
Derived SI Units
We can derive many units from the seven SI base units. For example, we can use the base unit of length to define a
unit of volume, and the base units of mass and length to define a unit of density.
Volume
Volume is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The standard SI unit of volume is defined by
the base unit of length (Figure 1.25). The standard volume is a cubic meter (m3), a cube with an edge length of
exactly one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one
meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.
A more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter (0.1 m, or 10 cm). A cube with edge lengths of
exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one cubic decimeter (dm3). A liter (L) is the more common name for the
cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.
A cubic centimeter (cm3) is the volume of a cube with an edge length of exactly one centimeter. The abbreviation cc
(for cubic centimeter) is often used by health professionals. A cubic centimeter is equivalent to a milliliter (mL) and
is 1/1000 of a liter.

The diameter of a dime is compared relative to the edge length of a 1-cm3 (1-mL) cube.
Density
We use the mass and volume of a substance to determine its density. Thus, the units of density are defined by the base
units of mass and length.
The density of a substance is the ratio of the mass of a sample of the substance to its volume. The SI unit for density
is the kilogram per cubic meter (kg/m3). For many situations, however, this as an inconvenient unit, and we often
use grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3) for the densities of solids and liquids, and grams per liter (g/L) for gases.
Although there are exceptions, most liquids and solids have densities that range from about 0.7 g/cm3 (the density of
gasoline) to 19 g/cm3 (the density of gold). The density of air is about 1.2 g/L. Table 1.4 shows the densities of some
common substances.
Densities of Common Substances
Solids Liquids Gases (at 25 °C and 1 atm)
ice (at 0 °C) 0.92 g/cm3 water 1.0 g/cm3 dry air 1.20 g/L
oak (wood) 0.60–0.90 g/cm3 ethanol 0.79 g/cm3 oxygen 1.31 g/L

While there are many ways to determine the density of an object, perhaps the most straightforward method involves
34 Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas

separately finding the mass and volume of the object, and then dividing the mass of the sample by its volume. In
the following example, the mass is found directly by weighing, but the volume is found indirectly through length
measurements.
density = mass
volume
Example 1.1
Calculation of Density
Gold—in bricks, bars, and coins—has been a form of currency for centuries. In order to swindle people
into paying for a brick of gold without actually investing in a brick of gold, people have considered filling
the centers of hollow gold bricks with lead to fool buyers into thinking that the entire brick is gold. It does
not work: Lead is a dense substance, but its density is not as great as that of gold, 19.3 g/cm3. What is the
density of lead if a cube of lead has an edge length of 2.00 cm and a mass of 90.7 g?
Solution
The density of a substance can be calculated by dividing its mass by its volume. The volume of a cube is
calculated by cubing the edge length.
volume of lead cube = 2.00 cm × 2.00 cm × 2.00 cm = 8.00 cm3
density = mass
volume = 90.7 g
8.00 cm3 = 11.3 g
1.00 cm3 = 11.3 g/cm3

Using Displacement of Water to Determine Density
This PhET simulation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16phetmasvolden) illustrates another way to
determine density, using displacement of water. Determine the density of the red and yellow blocks.
Solution
When you open the density simulation and select Same Mass, you can choose from several 5.00-kg colored
blocks that you can drop into a tank containing 100.00 L water. The yellow block floats (it is less dense than

Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 35
water), and the water level rises to 105.00 L. While floating, the yellow block displaces 5.00 L water, an
amount equal to the weight of the block. The red block sinks (it is more dense than water, which has density
= 1.00 kg/L), and the water level rises to 101.25 L.
The red block therefore displaces 1.25 L water, an amount equal to the volume of the block. The density of
the red block is:
density = mass
volume = 5.00 kg
1.25 L = 4.00 kg/L
Note that since the yellow block is not completely submerged, you cannot determine its density from this
information. But if you hold the yellow block on the bottom of the tank, the water level rises to 110.00 L,
which means that it now displaces 10.00 L water, and its density can be found:
density = mass
volume = 5.00 kg
10.00 L = 0.500 kg/L

Remove all of the blocks from the water and add the green block to the tank of water, placing it
approximately in the middle of the tank. Determine the density of the green block.
Answer: 2.00 kg/L
1.5 Measurement Uncertainty, Accuracy, and Precision
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define accuracy and precision
• Distinguish exact and uncertain numbers
• Correctly represent uncertainty in quantities using significant figures
• Apply proper rounding rules to computed quantities
Counting is the only type of measurement that is free from uncertainty, provided the number of objects being counted
does not change while the counting process is underway. The result of such a counting measurement is an example of
an exact number. By counting the eggs in a carton, one can determine exactly how many eggs the carton contains.
The numbers of defined quantities are also exact. By definition, 1 foot is exactly 12 inches, 1 inch is exactly 2.54
centimeters, and 1 gram is exactly 0.001 kilogram. Quantities derived from measurements other than counting,
however, are uncertain to varying extents due to practical limitations of the measurement process used.
Significant Figures in Measurement
The numbers of measured quantities, unlike defined or directly counted quantities, are not exact. To measure the
volume of liquid in a graduated cylinder, you should make a reading at the bottom of the meniscus, the lowest point
on the curved surface of the liquid.
36 Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Figure 1.26 To measure the volume of liquid in this graduated cylinder, you must mentally subdivide the distance
between the 21 and 22 mL marks into tenths of a milliliter, and then make a reading (estimate) at the bottom of the
meniscus.
Refer to the illustration in Figure 1.26. The bottom of the meniscus in this case clearly lies between the 21 and 22
markings, meaning the liquid volume is certainly greater than 21 mL but less than 22 mL. The meniscus appears to
be a bit closer to the 22-mL mark than to the 21-mL mark, and so a reasonable estimate of the liquid’s volume would
be 21.6 mL. In the number 21.6, then, the digits 2 and 1 are certain, but the 6 is an estimate. Some people might
estimate the meniscus position to be equally distant from each of the markings and estimate the tenth-place digit as
5, while others may think it to be even closer to the 22-mL mark and estimate this digit to be 7. Note that it would
be pointless to attempt to estimate a digit for the hundredths place, given that the tenths-place digit is uncertain. In
general, numerical scales such as the one on this graduated cylinder will permit measurements to one-tenth of the
smallest scale division. The scale in this case has 1-mL divisions, and so volumes may be measured to the nearest 0.1
mL.
This concept holds true for all measurements, even if you do not actively make an estimate. If you place a quarter on
a standard electronic balance, you may obtain a reading of 6.72 g. The digits 6 and 7 are certain, and the 2 indicates
that the mass of the quarter is likely between 6.71 and 6.73 grams. The quarter weighs about 6.72 grams, with a
nominal uncertainty in the measurement of ± 0.01 gram. If the coin is weighed on a more sensitive balance, the mass
might be 6.723 g. This means its mass lies between 6.722 and 6.724 grams, an uncertainty of 0.001 gram. Every
measurement has some uncertainty, which depends on the device used (and the user’s ability). All of the digits in
a measurement, including the uncertain last digit, are called significant figures or significant digits. Note that zero
may be a measured value; for example, if you stand on a scale that shows weight to the nearest pound and it shows
“120,” then the 1 (hundreds), 2 (tens) and 0 (ones) are all significant (measured) values.
A measurement result is properly reported when its significant digits accurately represent the certainty of the
measurement process. But what if you were analyzing a reported value and trying to determine what is significant
and what is not? Well, for starters, all nonzero digits are significant, and it is only zeros that require some thought. We
will use the terms “leading,” “trailing,” and “captive” for the zeros and will consider how to deal with them.
Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 37
Starting with the first nonzero digit on the left, count this digit and all remaining digits to the right. This is the number
of significant figures in the measurement unless the last digit is a trailing zero lying to the left of the decimal point.
Captive zeros result from measurement and are therefore always significant. Leading zeros, however, are never
significant—they merely tell us where the decimal point is located.
The leading zeros in this example are not significant. We could use exponential notation (as described in Appendix
B) and express the number as 8.32407 × 10−3; then the number 8.32407 contains all of the significant figures, and
10−3 locates the decimal point.
The number of significant figures is uncertain in a number that ends with a zero to the left of the decimal point
location. The zeros in the measurement 1,300 grams could be significant or they could simply indicate where the
decimal point is located. The ambiguity can be resolved with the use of exponential notation: 1.3 × 103 (two
significant figures), 1.30 × 103 (three significant figures, if the tens place was measured), or 1.300 × 103 (four
significant figures, if the ones place was also measured). In cases where only the decimal-formatted number is
available, it is prudent to assume that all trailing zeros are not significant.
When determining significant figures, be sure to pay attention to reported values and think about the measurement
and significant figures in terms of what is reasonable or likely when evaluating whether the value makes sense. For
example, the official January 2014 census reported the resident population of the US as 317,297,725. Do you think
the US population was correctly determined to the reported nine significant figures, that is, to the exact number of
people? People are constantly being born, dying, or moving into or out of the country, and assumptions are made to
account for the large number of people who are not actually counted. Because of these uncertainties, it might be more
reasonable to expect that we know the population to within perhaps a million or so, in which case the population
should be reported as 3.17 × 108 people.
Significant Figures in Calculations
A second important principle of uncertainty is that results calculated from a measurement are at least as uncertain as
38 Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
the measurement itself. Take the uncertainty in measurements into account to avoid misrepresenting the uncertainty
in calculated results. One way to do this is to report the result of a calculation with the correct number of significant
figures, which is determined by the following three rules for rounding numbers:
1. When adding or subtracting numbers, round the result to the same number of decimal places as the number
with the least number of decimal places (the least certain value in terms of addition and subtraction).
2. When multiplying or dividing numbers, round the result to the same number of digits as the number with the
least number of significant figures (the least certain value in terms of multiplication and division).
3. If the digit to be dropped (the one immediately to the right of the digit to be retained) is less than 5, “round
down” and leave the retained digit unchanged; if it is more than 5, “round up” and increase the retained digit
by 1; if the dropped digit is 5, round up or down, whichever yields an even value for the retained digit. (The
last part of this rule may strike you as a bit odd, but it’s based on reliable statistics and is aimed at avoiding
any bias when dropping the digit “5,” since it is equally close to both possible values of the retained digit.)
The following examples illustrate the application of this rule in rounding a few different numbers to three significant
figures:
• 0.028675 rounds “up” to 0.0287 (the dropped digit, 7, is greater than 5)
• 18.3384 rounds “down” to 18.3 (the dropped digit, 3, is less than 5)
• 6.8752 rounds “up” to 6.88 (the dropped digit is 5, and the retained digit is even)
• 92.85 rounds “down” to 92.8 (the dropped digit is 5, and the retained digit is even)

figures and rounding—to correctly represent the certainty of the values reported and to ensure that a calculated result
is not represented as being more certain than the least certain value used in the calculation.

Accuracy and Precision
Scientists typically make repeated measurements of a quantity to ensure the quality of their findings and to evaluate
both the precision and the accuracy of their results. Measurements are said to be precise if they yield very similar
results when repeated in the same manner. A measurement is considered accurate if it yields a result that is very close
to the true or accepted value. Precise values agree with each other; accurate values agree with a true value. These
characterizations can be extended to other contexts, such as the results of an archery competition (Figure 1.27).
Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 43
Figure 1.27 (a) These arrows are close to both the bull’s eye and one another, so they are both accurate and
precise. (b) These arrows are close to one another but not on target, so they are precise but not accurate. (c) These
arrows are neither on target nor close to one another, so they are neither accurate nor precise.
Suppose a quality control chemist at a pharmaceutical company is tasked with checking the accuracy and precision
of three different machines that are meant to dispense 10 ounces (296 mL) of cough syrup into storage bottles. She
proceeds to use each machine to fill five bottles and then carefully determines the actual volume dispensed, obtaining
the results tabulated in Table 1.5.
Volume (mL) of Cough Medicine Delivered by 10-oz (296 mL) Dispensers
Dispenser #1 Dispenser #2 Dispenser #3

Considering these results, she will report that dispenser #1 is precise (values all close to one another, within a few
tenths of a milliliter) but not accurate (none of the values are close to the target value of 296 mL, each being more
than 10 mL too low). Results for dispenser #2 represent improved accuracy (each volume is less than 3 mL away
from 296 mL) but worse precision (volumes vary by more than 4 mL). Finally, she can report that dispenser #3 is
working well, dispensing cough syrup both accurately (all volumes within 0.1 mL of the target volume) and precisely
(volumes differing from each other by no more than 0.2 mL).
1.6 Mathematical Treatment of Measurement Results
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the dimensional analysis (factor label) approach to mathematical calculations involving quantities
• Use dimensional analysis to carry out unit conversions for a given property and computations involving two
or more properties
44 Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
It is often the case that a quantity of interest may not be easy (or even possible) to measure directly but instead
must be calculated from other directly measured properties and appropriate mathematical relationships. For example,
consider measuring the average speed of an athlete running sprints. This is typically accomplished by measuring the
time required for the athlete to run from the starting line to the finish line, and the distance between these two lines,
and then computing speed from the equation that relates these three properties:
speed = distance
time
An Olympic-quality sprinter can run 100 m in approximately 10 s, corresponding to an average speed of
100 m
10 s = 10 m/s
Note that this simple arithmetic involves dividing the numbers of each measured quantity to yield the number of
the computed quantity (100/10 = 10) and likewise dividing the units of each measured quantity to yield the unit of
the computed quantity (m/s = m/s). Now, consider using this same relation to predict the time required for a person
running at this speed to travel a distance of 25 m. The same relation among the three properties is used, but in this
case, the two quantities provided are a speed (10 m/s) and a distance (25 m). To yield the sought property, time, the
equation must be rearranged appropriately:
time = distance
speed
The time can then be computed as:
25 m
10 m/s = 2.5 s
Again, arithmetic on the numbers (25/10 = 2.5) was accompanied by the same arithmetic on the units (m/m/s = s) to
yield the number and unit of the result, 2.5 s. Note that, just as for numbers, when a unit is divided by an identical
unit (in this case, m/m), the result is “1”—or, as commonly phrased, the units “cancel.”
These calculations are examples of a versatile mathematical approach known as dimensional analysis (or the factor-
label method). Dimensional analysis is based on this premise: the units of quantities must be subjected to the same
mathematical operations as their associated numbers. This method can be applied to computations ranging from
simple unit conversions to more complex, multi-step calculations involving several different quantities.
Conversion Factors and Dimensional Analysis
A ratio of two equivalent quantities expressed with different measurement units can be used as a unit conversion
factor. For example, the lengths of 2.54 cm and 1 in. are equivalent (by definition), and so a unit conversion factor
may be derived from the ratio,
2.54 cm
1 in. (2.54 cm = 1 in.) or 2.54 cm
in.
Several other commonly used conversion factors are given in Table 1.6.
Common Conversion Factors
Length Volume Mass
1 m = 1.0936 yd 1 L = 1.0567 qt 1 kg = 2.2046 lb
1 in. = 2.54 cm (exact) 1 qt = 0.94635 L 1 lb = 453.59 g
1 km = 0.62137 mi 1 ft3 = 28.317 L 1 (avoirdupois) oz = 28.349 g
1 mi = 1609.3 m 1 tbsp = 14.787 mL 1 (troy) oz = 31.103 g
Table 1.6
Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas 45
When a quantity (such as distance in inches) is multiplied by an appropriate unit conversion factor, the quantity is
converted to an equivalent value with different units (such as distance in centimeters). For example, a basketball
player’s vertical jump of 34 inches can be converted to centimeters by:
34 in. × 2.54 cm
1 in. = 86 cm
Since this simple arithmetic involves quantities, the premise of dimensional analysis requires that we multiply both
numbers and units. The numbers of these two quantities are multiplied to yield the number of the product quantity, 86,
whereas the units are multiplied to yield in. × cm
in. . Just as for numbers, a ratio of identical units is also numerically
equal to one, in.
in. = 1, and the unit product thus simplifies to cm. (When identical units divide to yield a factor of
1, they are said to “cancel.”) Dimensional analysis may be used to confirm the proper application of unit conversion
factors as demonstrated in the following example.
Example 1.8
Using a Unit Conversion Factor
The mass of a competition frisbee is 125 g. Convert its mass to ounces using the unit conversion factor
derived from the relationship 1 oz = 28.349 g (Table 1.6).
Solution
Given the conversion factor, the mass in ounces may be derived using an equation similar to the one used
for converting length from inches to centimeters.
x oz = 125 g × unit conversion factor
The unit conversion factor may be represented as:
1 oz
28.349 g and 28.349 g
1 oz
The correct unit conversion factor is the ratio that cancels the units of grams and leaves ounces.
x oz = 125 g × 1 oz
28.349 g
= ⎛
⎝ 125

Beyond simple unit conversions, the factor-label method can be used to solve more complex problems involving
computations. Regardless of the details, the basic approach is the same—all the factors involved in the calculation
must be appropriately oriented to ensure that their labels (units) will appropriately cancel and/or combine to yield the
desired unit in the result. As your study of chemistry continues, you will encounter many opportunities to apply this
approach.

Mathematical Relations
What is the density of common antifreeze in units of g/mL? A 4.00-qt sample of the antifreeze weighs 9.26
lb.
Solution
Since density = mass
volume , we need to divide the mass in grams by the volume in milliliters. In general: the
number of units of B = the number of units of A × unit conversion factor. The necessary conversion factors
are given in Table 1.6: 1 lb = 453.59 g; 1 L = 1.0567 qt; 1 L = 1,000 mL. Mass may be converted from
pounds to grams as follows:
9.26 lb × 453.59 g
1 lb = 4.20 × 103 g
Volume may be converted from quarts to millimeters via two steps:
Step 1. Convert quarts to liters.
4.00 qt × 1 L
1.0567 qt = 3.78 L
Step 2. Convert liters to milliliters.
3.78 L × 1000 mL
1 L = 3.78 × 103 mL
Then,
density = 4.20 × 103 g
3.78 × 103 mL = 1.11 g/mL
Alternatively, the calculation could be set up in a way that uses three unit conversion factors sequentially as
follows:
9.26 lb

Finally,

56.3 gal = 13.8 miles/gallon = 13.8 mpg
Alternatively, the calculation could be set up in a way that uses all the conversion factors sequentially, as
follows:

1 km × 1 L

Conversion of Temperature Units
We use the word temperature to refer to the hotness or coldness of a substance. One way we measure a change in
temperature is to use the fact that most substances expand when their temperature increases and contract when their
temperature decreases. The mercury or alcohol in a common glass thermometer changes its volume as the temperature
changes, and the position of the trapped liquid along a printed scale may be used as a measure of temperature.
Temperature scales are defined relative to selected reference temperatures: Two of the most commonly used are the
freezing and boiling temperatures of water at a specified atmospheric pressure. On the Celsius scale, 0 °C is defined
as the freezing temperature of water and 100 °C as the boiling temperature of water. The space between the two
temperatures is divided into 100 equal intervals, which we call degrees. On the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point of
water is defined as 32 °F and the boiling temperature as 212 °F. The space between these two points on a Fahrenheit
thermometer is divided into 180 equal parts (degrees).
Defining the Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales as described in the previous paragraph results in a slightly
more complex relationship between temperature values on these two scales than for different units of measure for
other properties. Most measurement units for a given property are directly proportional to one another (y = mx). Using
familiar length units as one example:
length in feet = ⎛
⎝ 1 ft
12 in.

⎠ × length in inches
where y = length in feet, x = length in inches, and the proportionality constant, m, is the conversion factor. The Celsius

and Fahrenheit temperature scales, however, do not share a common zero point, and so the relationship between these
two scales is a linear one rather than a proportional one (y = mx + b). Consequently, converting a temperature from
one of these scales into the other requires more than simple multiplication by a conversion factor, m, it also must take
into account differences in the scales’ zero points (b).
The linear equation relating Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures is easily derived from the two temperatures used
to define each scale. Representing the Celsius temperature as x and the Fahrenheit temperature as y, the slope, m, is
computed to be:
m = Δy
Δx = 212 °F − 32 °F
100 °C − 0 °C = 180 °F
100 °C = 9 °F
5 °C
The y-intercept of the equation, b, is then calculated using either of the equivalent temperature pairs, (100 °C, 212 °F)
or (0 °C, 32 °F), as:
b = y − mx = 32 °F − 9 °F
5 °C × 0 °C = 32 °F
The equation relating the temperature (T) scales is then:
T°F = ⎛
⎝9 °F
5 °C × T°C⎞
⎠ + 32 °C
An abbreviated form of this equation that omits the measurement units is:
T°F = ⎛
⎝ 9
5 × T°C⎞
⎠ + 32
Rearrangement of this equation yields the form useful for converting from Fahrenheit to Celsius:
T°C = 5
9
⎛
⎝T°F − 32⎞
⎠
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the SI unit of temperature is the kelvin (K). Unlike the Celsius and Fahrenheit
scales, the kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale in which 0 (zero) K corresponds to the lowest temperature that
can theoretically be achieved. Since the kelvin temperature scale is absolute, a degree symbol is not included in the
unit abbreviation, K. The early 19th-century discovery of the relationship between a gas’s volume and temperature
suggested that the volume of a gas would be zero at −273.15 °C. In 1848, British physicist William Thompson, who
later adopted the title of Lord Kelvin, proposed an absolute temperature scale based on this concept (further treatment
of this topic is provided in this text’s chapter on gases).
The freezing temperature of water on this scale is 273.15 K and its boiling temperature is 373.15 K. Notice the
numerical difference in these two reference temperatures is 100, the same as for the Celsius scale, and so the linear
relation between these two temperature scales will exhibit a slope of 1 K
°C . Following the same approach, the
equations for converting between the kelvin and Celsius temperature scales are derived to be:
TK = T°C + 273.15
T°C = TK − 273.15
The 273.15 in these equations has been determined experimentally, so it is not exact. Figure 1.28 shows the
relationship among the three temperature scales.

Although the kelvin (absolute) temperature scale is the official SI temperature scale, Celsius is commonly used in
many scientific contexts and is the scale of choice for nonscience contexts in almost all areas of the world. Very
few countries (the U.S. and its territories, the Bahamas, Belize, Cayman Islands, and Palau) still use Fahrenheit for
weather, medicine, and cooking.

Summary
1.1 Chemistry in Context
Chemistry deals with the composition, structure, and properties of matter, and the ways by which various forms of
matter may be interconverted. Thus, it occupies a central place in the study and practice of science and technology.
Chemists use the scientific method to perform experiments, pose hypotheses, and formulate laws and develop
theories, so that they can better understand the behavior of the natural world. To do so, they operate in the
macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic domains. Chemists measure, analyze, purify, and synthesize a wide variety
of substances that are important to our lives.
1.2 Phases and Classification of Matter
Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass. The basic building block of matter is the atom, the smallest
unit of an element that can enter into combinations with atoms of the same or other elements. In many substances,
atoms are combined into molecules. On earth, matter commonly exists in three states: solids, of fixed shape and
volume; liquids, of variable shape but fixed volume; and gases, of variable shape and volume. Under high-temperature
conditions, matter also can exist as a plasma. Most matter is a mixture: It is composed of two or more types of
matter that can be present in varying amounts and can be separated by physical means. Heterogeneous mixtures vary
in composition from point to point; homogeneous mixtures have the same composition from point to point. Pure
substances consist of only one type of matter. A pure substance can be an element, which consists of only one type
of atom and cannot be broken down by a chemical change, or a compound, which consists of two or more types of
atoms.
1.3 Physical and Chemical Properties
All substances have distinct physical and chemical properties, and may undergo physical or chemical changes.
Physical properties, such as hardness and boiling point, and physical changes, such as melting or freezing, do not
involve a change in the composition of matter. Chemical properties, such flammability and acidity, and chemical
changes, such as rusting, involve production of matter that differs from that present beforehand.
Measurable properties fall into one of two categories. Extensive properties depend on the amount of matter present,
for example, the mass of gold. Intensive properties do not depend on the amount of matter present, for example, the
density of gold. Heat is an example of an extensive property, and temperature is an example of an intensive property.
1.4 Measurements
Measurements provide quantitative information that is critical in studying and practicing chemistry. Each
measurement has an amount, a unit for comparison, and an uncertainty. Measurements can be represented in either
decimal or scientific notation. Scientists primarily use SI (International System) units such as meters, seconds, and
kilograms, as well as derived units, such as liters (for volume) and g/cm3 (for density). In many cases, it is convenient
54 Chapter 1 | Essential Ideas
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
to use prefixes that yield fractional and multiple units, such as microseconds (10−6 seconds) and megahertz (106
hertz), respectively.
1.5 Measurement Uncertainty, Accuracy, and Precision
Quantities can be defined or measured. Measured quantities have an associated uncertainty that is represented by
the number of significant figures in the quantity’s number. The uncertainty of a calculated quantity depends on the
uncertainties in the quantities used in the calculation and is reflected in how the value is rounded. Quantities are
characterized with regard to accuracy (closeness to a true or accepted value) and precision (variation among replicate
measurement results).
1.6 Mathematical Treatment of Measurement Results
Measurements are made using a variety of units. It is often useful or necessary to convert a measured quantity from
one unit into another. These conversions are accomplished using unit conversion factors, which are derived by simple
applications of a mathematical approach called the factor-label method or dimensional analysis. This strategy is also
employed to calculate sought quantities using measured quantities and appropriate mathematical relations.

Introduction
Your overall health and susceptibility to disease depends upon the complex interaction between your genetic makeup
and environmental exposure, with the outcome difficult to predict. Early detection of biomarkers, substances that
indicate an organism’s disease or physiological state, could allow diagnosis and treatment before a condition becomes
serious or irreversible. Recent studies have shown that your exhaled breath can contain molecules that may be
biomarkers for recent exposure to environmental contaminants or for pathological conditions ranging from asthma
to lung cancer. Scientists are working to develop biomarker “fingerprints” that could be used to diagnose a specific
disease based on the amounts and identities of certain molecules in a patient’s exhaled breath. An essential concept
underlying this goal is that of a molecule’s identity, which is determined by the numbers and types of atoms it
contains, and how they are bonded together. This chapter will describe some of the fundamental chemical principles
related to the composition of matter, including those central to the concept of molecular identity.

2.1 Early Ideas in Atomic Theory
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• State the postulates of Dalton’s atomic theory
• Use postulates of Dalton’s atomic theory to explain the laws of definite and multiple proportions
The earliest recorded discussion of the basic structure of matter comes from ancient Greek philosophers, the scientists
of their day. In the fifth century BC, Leucippus and Democritus argued that all matter was composed of small, finite
particles that they called atomos, a term derived from the Greek word for “indivisible.” They thought of atoms as
moving particles that differed in shape and size, and which could join together. Later, Aristotle and others came to
the conclusion that matter consisted of various combinations of the four “elements”—fire, earth, air, and water—and
could be infinitely divided. Interestingly, these philosophers thought about atoms and “elements” as philosophical
concepts, but apparently never considered performing experiments to test their ideas.
The Aristotelian view of the composition of matter held sway for over two thousand years, until English schoolteacher
John Dalton helped to revolutionize chemistry with his hypothesis that the behavior of matter could be explained
using an atomic theory. First published in 1807, many of Dalton’s hypotheses about the microscopic features of matter
are still valid in modern atomic theory. Here are the postulates of Dalton’s atomic theory.
1. Matter is composed of exceedingly small particles called atoms. An atom is the smallest unit of an element
that can participate in a chemical change.
2. An element consists of only one type of atom, which has a mass that is characteristic of the element and is the
same for all atoms of that element (Figure 2.2). A macroscopic sample of an element contains an incredibly
large number of atoms, all of which have identical chemical properties.
Figure 2.2 A pre-1982 copper penny (left) contains approximately 3 × 1022 copper atoms (several dozen
are represented as brown spheres at the right), each of which has the same chemical properties. (credit:
modification of work by “slgckgc”/Flickr)
3. Atoms of one element differ in properties from atoms of all other elements.
4. A compound consists of atoms of two or more elements combined in a small, whole-number ratio. In a given
compound, the numbers of atoms of each of its elements are always present in the same ratio (Figure 2.3).

atoms—copper (brown spheres) and oxygen (red spheres)—in a 1:1 ratio. (credit: modification of work by
“Chemicalinterest”/Wikimedia Commons)
5. Atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change, but are instead rearranged to yield
substances that are different from those present before the change (Figure 2.4).
Figure 2.4 When the elements copper (a shiny, red-brown solid, shown here as brown spheres) and oxygen
(a clear and colorless gas, shown here as red spheres) react, their atoms rearrange to form a compound
containing copper and oxygen (a powdery, black solid). (credit copper: modification of work by http://images-

Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 69
Dalton’s atomic theory provides a microscopic explanation of the many macroscopic properties of matter that you’ve
learned about. For example, if an element such as copper consists of only one kind of atom, then it cannot be broken
down into simpler substances, that is, into substances composed of fewer types of atoms. And if atoms are neither
created nor destroyed during a chemical change, then the total mass of matter present when matter changes from one
type to another will remain constant (the law of conservation of matter).
Example 2.1
Testing Dalton’s Atomic Theory
In the following drawing, the green spheres represent atoms of a certain element. The purple spheres
represent atoms of another element. If the spheres touch, they are part of a single unit of a compound. Does
the following chemical change represented by these symbols violate any of the ideas of Dalton’s atomic
theory? If so, which one?
Solution
The starting materials consist of two green spheres and two purple spheres. The products consist of only
one green sphere and one purple sphere. This violates Dalton’s postulate that atoms are neither created nor
destroyed during a chemical change, but are merely redistributed. (In this case, atoms appear to have been
destroyed.)

represent atoms of another element. If the spheres touch, they are part of a single unit of a compound. Does
the following chemical change represented by these symbols violate any of the ideas of Dalton’s atomic
theory? If so, which one?
Answer: The starting materials consist of four green spheres and two purple spheres. The products consist
of four green spheres and two purple spheres. This does not violate any of Dalton’s postulates: Atoms are
neither created nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios.
Dalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that all samples of a pure
compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite
proportions or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given
compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples
of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they
are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in Table 2.1.
Constant Composition of Isooctane
Sample Carbon Hydrogen Mass Ratio
A 14.82 g 2.78 g 14.82 g carbon
2.78 g hydrogen = 5.33 g carbon
1.00 g hydrogen

Constant Composition of Isooctane

C 19.40 g 3.64 g 19.40 g carbon
3.63 g hydrogen = 5.33 g carbon
1.00 g hydrogen
Table 2.1
It is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not
true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example,
there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00.
Dalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law.
The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass
of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole numbers. For example, copper
and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a
brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem
particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly
surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.
1.116 g Cl
1 g Cu
0.558 g Cl
1 g Cu
= 2
1
This 2-to-1 ratio means that the brown compound has twice the amount of chlorine per amount of copper as the green
compound.
This can be explained by atomic theory if the copper-to-chlorine ratio in the brown compound is 1 copper atom to 2
chlorine atoms, and the ratio in the green compound is 1 copper atom to 1 chlorine atom. The ratio of chlorine atoms
(and thus the ratio of their masses) is therefore 2 to 1 (Figure 2.5).
Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 71
Figure 2.5 Compared to the copper chlorine compound in (a), where copper is represented by brown spheres and
chlorine by green spheres, the copper chlorine compound in (b) has twice as many chlorine atoms per copper atom.

Example 2.2
Laws of Definite and Multiple Proportions
A sample of compound A (a clear, colorless gas) is analyzed and found to contain 4.27 g carbon and 5.69
g oxygen. A sample of compound B (also a clear, colorless gas) is analyzed and found to contain 5.19 g
carbon and 13.84 g oxygen. Are these data an example of the law of definite proportions, the law of multiple
proportions, or neither? What do these data tell you about substances A and B?
Solution
In compound A, the mass ratio of carbon to oxygen is:
1.33 g O
1 g C
In compound B, the mass ratio of carbon to oxygen is:
2.67 g O
1 g C
The ratio of these ratios is:
1.33 g O
1 g C
2.67 g O
1 g C
= 1
2
This supports the law of multiple proportions. This means that A and B are different compounds, with A
having one-half as much oxygen per amount of carbon (or twice as much carbon per amount of oxygen) as
B. A possible pair of compounds that would fit this relationship would be A = CO and B = CO2.

the law of multiple proportions, or neither? What do these data tell you about substances X and Y?
Answer: In compound X, the mass ratio of carbon to hydrogen is 14.13 g C
2.96 g H . In compound Y, the mass
ratio of carbon to oxygen is 19.91 g C
3.34 g H . The ratio of these ratios is
14.13 g C
2.96 g H
19.91 g C
3.34 g H
= 4.77 g C/g H
5.96 g C/g H = 0.800 = 4
5. This small, whole-number ratio supports the law of multiple
proportions. This means that X and Y are different compounds.
2.2 Evolution of Atomic Theory
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Outline milestones in the development of modern atomic theory
• Summarize and interpret the results of the experiments of Thomson, Millikan, and Rutherford
• Describe the three subatomic particles that compose atoms
• Define isotopes and give examples for several elements
If matter is composed of atoms, what are atoms composed of? Are they the smallest particles, or is there something
smaller? In the late 1800s, a number of scientists interested in questions like these investigated the electrical
discharges that could be produced in low-pressure gases, with the most significant discovery made by English
physicist J. J. Thomson using a cathode ray tube. This apparatus consisted of a sealed glass tube from which almost
all the air had been removed; the tube contained two metal electrodes. When high voltage was applied across the
electrodes, a visible beam called a cathode ray appeared between them. This beam was deflected toward the positive
charge and away from the negative charge, and was produced in the same way with identical properties when different
metals were used for the electrodes. In similar experiments, the ray was simultaneously deflected by an applied
magnetic field, and measurements of the extent of deflection and the magnetic field strength allowed Thomson to
calculate the charge-to-mass ratio of the cathode ray particles. The results of these measurements indicated that these
particles were much lighter than atoms (Figure 2.6).
Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 73
Figure 2.6 (a) J. J. Thomson produced a visible beam in a cathode ray tube. (b) This is an early cathode ray tube,
invented in 1897 by Ferdinand Braun. (c) In the cathode ray, the beam (shown in yellow) comes from the cathode and
is accelerated past the anode toward a fluorescent scale at the end of the tube. Simultaneous deflections by applied
electric and magnetic fields permitted Thomson to calculate the mass-to-charge ratio of the particles composing the
cathode ray. (credit a: modification of work by Nobel Foundation; credit b: modification of work by Eugen Nesper;
credit c: modification of work by “Kurzon”/Wikimedia Commons)
Based on his observations, here is what Thomson proposed and why: The particles are attracted by positive (+)
charges and repelled by negative (−) charges, so they must be negatively charged (like charges repel and unlike
charges attract); they are less massive than atoms and indistinguishable, regardless of the source material, so they
must be fundamental, subatomic constituents of all atoms. Although controversial at the time, Thomson’s idea was
gradually accepted, and his cathode ray particle is what we now call an electron, a negatively charged, subatomic
particle with a mass more than one thousand-times less that of an atom. The term “electron” was coined in 1891 by
Irish physicist George Stoney, from “electric ion.”

own voice.
In 1909, more information about the electron was uncovered by American physicist Robert A. Millikan via his “oil
drop” experiments. Millikan created microscopic oil droplets, which could be electrically charged by friction as they
Link to Learning
74 Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions

formed or by using X-rays. These droplets initially fell due to gravity, but their downward progress could be slowed
or even reversed by an electric field lower in the apparatus. By adjusting the electric field strength and making careful
measurements and appropriate calculations, Millikan was able to determine the charge on individual drops (Figure
2.7).
Figure 2.7 Millikan’s experiment measured the charge of individual oil drops. The tabulated data are examples of a
few possible values.
Looking at the charge data that Millikan gathered, you may have recognized that the charge of an oil droplet is always
a multiple of a specific charge, 1.6 × 10−19 C. Millikan concluded that this value must therefore be a fundamental
charge—the charge of a single electron—with his measured charges due to an excess of one electron (1 times 1.6 ×
10−19 C), two electrons (2 times 1.6 × 10−19 C), three electrons (3 times 1.6 × 10−19 C), and so on, on a given oil
droplet. Since the charge of an electron was now known due to Millikan’s research, and the charge-to-mass ratio was
already known due to Thomson’s research (1.759 × 1011 C/kg), it only required a simple calculation to determine
the mass of the electron as well.
Mass of electron = 1.602 × 10−19 C × 1 kg
1.759 × 1011 C = 9.107 × 10−31 kg
Scientists had now established that the atom was not indivisible as Dalton had believed, and due to the work of
Thomson, Millikan, and others, the charge and mass of the negative, subatomic particles—the electrons—were
known. However, the positively charged part of an atom was not yet well understood. In 1904, Thomson proposed
the “plum pudding” model of atoms, which described a positively charged mass with an equal amount of negative
charge in the form of electrons embedded in it, since all atoms are electrically neutral. A competing model had been
proposed in 1903 by Hantaro Nagaoka, who postulated a Saturn-like atom, consisting of a positively charged sphere
surrounded by a halo of electrons (Figure 2.8).
Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 75
Figure 2.8 (a) Thomson suggested that atoms resembled plum pudding, an English dessert consisting of moist cake
with embedded raisins (“plums”). (b) Nagaoka proposed that atoms resembled the planet Saturn, with a ring of
electrons surrounding a positive “planet.” (credit a: modification of work by “Man vyi”/Wikimedia Commons; credit b:

The next major development in understanding the atom came from Ernest Rutherford, a physicist from New Zealand
who largely spent his scientific career in Canada and England. He performed a series of experiments using a beam of
high-speed, positively charged alpha particles (α particles) that were produced by the radioactive decay of radium;
α particles consist of two protons and two neutrons (you will learn more about radioactive decay in the chapter
on nuclear chemistry). Rutherford and his colleagues Hans Geiger (later famous for the Geiger counter) and Ernest
Marsden aimed a beam of α particles, the source of which was embedded in a lead block to absorb most of the
radiation, at a very thin piece of gold foil and examined the resultant scattering of the α particles using a luminescent
screen that glowed briefly where hit by an α particle.
What did they discover? Most particles passed right through the foil without being deflected at all. However, some
were diverted slightly, and a very small number were deflected almost straight back toward the source (Figure 2.9).
Rutherford described finding these results: “It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in
my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit
you.”[1]

shown in this schematic diagram of their experiment. Most of the particles passed straight through the foil, but a few
were deflected slightly and a very small number were significantly deflected.
Here is what Rutherford deduced: Because most of the fast-moving α particles passed through the gold atoms
undeflected, they must have traveled through essentially empty space inside the atom. Alpha particles are positively
charged, so deflections arose when they encountered another positive charge (like charges repel each other). Since
like charges repel one another, the few positively charged α particles that changed paths abruptly must have hit, or
closely approached, another body that also had a highly concentrated, positive charge. Since the deflections occurred
a small fraction of the time, this charge only occupied a small amount of the space in the gold foil. Analyzing a series
of such experiments in detail, Rutherford drew two conclusions:
1. The volume occupied by an atom must consist of a large amount of empty space.
2. A small, relatively heavy, positively charged body, the nucleus, must be at the center of each atom.
View this simulation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16Rutherford) of the Rutherford gold foil experiment.
Adjust the slit width to produce a narrower or broader beam of α particles to see how that affects the
scattering pattern.
This analysis led Rutherford to propose a model in which an atom consists of a very small, positively charged nucleus,
in which most of the mass of the atom is concentrated, surrounded by the negatively charged electrons, so that the
atom is electrically neutral (Figure 2.10). After many more experiments, Rutherford also discovered that the nuclei
of other elements contain the hydrogen nucleus as a “building block,” and he named this more fundamental particle
the proton, the positively charged, subatomic particle found in the nucleus. With one addition, which you will learn
next, this nuclear model of the atom, proposed over a century ago, is still used today.

Figure 2.10 The α particles are deflected only when they collide with or pass close to the much heavier, positively
charged gold nucleus. Because the nucleus is very small compared to the size of an atom, very few α particles are
deflected. Most pass through the relatively large region occupied by electrons, which are too light to deflect the
rapidly moving particles.
The Rutherford Scattering simulation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16PhetScatter) allows you to
investigate the differences between a “plum pudding” atom and a Rutherford atom by firing α particles at
each type of atom.
Another important finding was the discovery of isotopes. During the early 1900s, scientists identified several
substances that appeared to be new elements, isolating them from radioactive ores. For example, a “new element”
produced by the radioactive decay of thorium was initially given the name mesothorium. However, a more detailed
analysis showed that mesothorium was chemically identical to radium (another decay product), despite having a
different atomic mass. This result, along with similar findings for other elements, led the English chemist Frederick
Soddy to realize that an element could have types of atoms with different masses that were chemically
indistinguishable. These different types are called isotopes—atoms of the same element that differ in mass. Soddy
was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1921 for this discovery.
One puzzle remained: The nucleus was known to contain almost all of the mass of an atom, with the number of
protons only providing half, or less, of that mass. Different proposals were made to explain what constituted the
remaining mass, including the existence of neutral particles in the nucleus. As you might expect, detecting uncharged
particles is very challenging, and it was not until 1932 that James Chadwick found evidence of neutrons, uncharged,
subatomic particles with a mass approximately the same as that of protons. The existence of the neutron also
explained isotopes: They differ in mass because they have different numbers of neutrons, but they are chemically

identical because they have the same number of protons. This will be explained in more detail later in this chapter.
2.3 Atomic Structure and Symbolism
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Write and interpret symbols that depict the atomic number, mass number, and charge of an atom or ion
• Define the atomic mass unit and average atomic mass
• Calculate average atomic mass and isotopic abundance
The development of modern atomic theory revealed much about the inner structure of atoms. It was learned that an
atom contains a very small nucleus composed of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons, surrounded by a
much larger volume of space containing negatively charged electrons. The nucleus contains the majority of an atom’s
mass because protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons, whereas electrons occupy almost all of an atom’s
volume. The diameter of an atom is on the order of 10−10 m, whereas the diameter of the nucleus is roughly 10−15
m—about 100,000 times smaller. For a perspective about their relative sizes, consider this: If the nucleus were the
size of a blueberry, the atom would be about the size of a football stadium (Figure 2.11).
Figure 2.11 If an atom could be expanded to the size of a football stadium, the nucleus would be the size of a single
blueberry. (credit middle: modification of work by “babyknight”/Wikimedia Commons; credit right: modification of work

Atoms—and the protons, neutrons, and electrons that compose them—are extremely small. For example, a carbon
atom weighs less than 2 × 10−23 g, and an electron has a charge of less than 2 × 10−19 C (coulomb). When
describing the properties of tiny objects such as atoms, we use appropriately small units of measure, such as the
atomic mass unit (amu) and the fundamental unit of charge (e). The amu was originally defined based on
hydrogen, the lightest element, then later in terms of oxygen. Since 1961, it has been defined with regard to the
most abundant isotope of carbon, atoms of which are assigned masses of exactly 12 amu. (This isotope is known as
“carbon-12” as will be discussed later in this module.) Thus, one amu is exactly 1
12 of the mass of one carbon-12
atom: 1 amu = 1.6605 × 10−24 g. (The Dalton (Da) and the unified atomic mass unit (u) are alternative units that
are equivalent to the amu.) The fundamental unit of charge (also called the elementary charge) equals the magnitude
of the charge of an electron (e) with e = 1.602 × 10−19 C.
A proton has a mass of 1.0073 amu and a charge of 1+. A neutron is a slightly heavier particle with a mass 1.0087
amu and a charge of zero; as its name suggests, it is neutral. The electron has a charge of 1− and is a much lighter
particle with a mass of about 0.00055 amu (it would take about 1800 electrons to equal the mass of one proton).
The properties of these fundamental particles are summarized in Table 2.2. (An observant student might notice that
the sum of an atom’s subatomic particles does not equal the atom’s actual mass: The total mass of six protons, six
Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 79
neutrons, and six electrons is 12.0993 amu, slightly larger than 12.00 amu. This “missing” mass is known as the mass
defect, and you will learn about it in the chapter on nuclear chemistry.)
Properties of Subatomic Particles
Name Location Charge (C) Unit Charge Mass (amu) Mass (g)
electron outside nucleus −1.602 × 10−19 1− 0.00055 0.00091 × 10−24
proton nucleus 1.602 × 10−19 1+ 1.00727 1.67262 × 10−24
neutron nucleus 0 0 1.00866 1.67493 × 10−24
Table 2.2
The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is its atomic number (Z). This is the defining trait of an element: Its
value determines the identity of the atom. For example, any atom that contains six protons is the element carbon and
has the atomic number 6, regardless of how many neutrons or electrons it may have. A neutral atom must contain the
same number of positive and negative charges, so the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Therefore,
the atomic number also indicates the number of electrons in an atom. The total number of protons and neutrons in an
atom is called its mass number (A). The number of neutrons is therefore the difference between the mass number
and the atomic number: A – Z = number of neutrons.
atomic number (Z) = number of protons
mass number (A) = number of protons + number of neutrons
A − Z = number of neutrons
Atoms are electrically neutral if they contain the same number of positively charged protons and negatively charged
electrons. When the numbers of these subatomic particles are not equal, the atom is electrically charged and is called
an ion. The charge of an atom is defined as follows:
Atomic charge = number of protons − number of electrons
As will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter, atoms (and molecules) typically acquire charge by gaining
or losing electrons. An atom that gains one or more electrons will exhibit a negative charge and is called an anion.
Positively charged atoms called cations are formed when an atom loses one or more electrons. For example, a neutral
sodium atom (Z = 11) has 11 electrons. If this atom loses one electron, it will become a cation with a 1+ charge (11
− 10 = 1+). A neutral oxygen atom (Z = 8) has eight electrons, and if it gains two electrons it will become an anion
with a 2− charge (8 − 10 = 2−).
Example 2.3
Composition of an Atom
Iodine is an essential trace element in our diet; it is needed to produce thyroid hormone. Insufficient iodine
in the diet can lead to the development of a goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid gland (Figure 2.12).

eliminate this concern in the US where salt consumption is high. (credit a: modification of work by
“Almazi”/Wikimedia Commons; credit b: modification of work by Mike Mozart)
The addition of small amounts of iodine to table salt (iodized salt) has essentially eliminated this health
concern in the United States, but as much as 40% of the world’s population is still at risk of iodine
deficiency. The iodine atoms are added as anions, and each has a 1− charge and a mass number of 127.
Determine the numbers of protons, neutrons, and electrons in one of these iodine anions.
Solution
The atomic number of iodine (53) tells us that a neutral iodine atom contains 53 protons in its nucleus and
53 electrons outside its nucleus. Because the sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons equals the mass
number, 127, the number of neutrons is 74 (127 − 53 = 74). Since the iodine is added as a 1− anion, the
number of electrons is 54 [53 – (1–) = 54].

Chemical Symbols
A chemical symbol is an abbreviation that we use to indicate an element or an atom of an element. For example, the
symbol for mercury is Hg (Figure 2.13). We use the same symbol to indicate one atom of mercury (microscopic
domain) or to label a container of many atoms of the element mercury (macroscopic domain).
Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 81
Figure 2.13 The symbol Hg represents the element mercury regardless of the amount; it could represent one atom
of mercury or a large amount of mercury.
The symbols for several common elements and their atoms are listed in Table 2.3. Some symbols are derived from
the common name of the element; others are abbreviations of the name in another language. Most symbols have one
or two letters, but three-letter symbols have been used to describe some elements that have atomic numbers greater
than 112. To avoid confusion with other notations, only the first letter of a symbol is capitalized. For example, Co is
the symbol for the element cobalt, but CO is the notation for the compound carbon monoxide, which contains atoms
of the elements carbon (C) and oxygen (O). All known elements and their symbols are in the periodic table in Figure
2.26 (also found in Appendix A).

Traditionally, the discoverer (or discoverers) of a new element names the element. However, until the name is
recognized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the recommended name of the new
element is based on the Latin word(s) for its atomic number. For example, element 106 was called unnilhexium
(Unh), element 107 was called unnilseptium (Uns), and element 108 was called unniloctium (Uno) for several years.
These elements are now named after scientists (or occasionally locations); for example, element 106 is now known as
seaborgium (Sg) in honor of Glenn Seaborg, a Nobel Prize winner who was active in the discovery of several heavy
elements.

Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, and explore its periodic table.
Isotopes
The symbol for a specific isotope of any element is written by placing the mass number as a superscript to the
left of the element symbol (Figure 2.14). The atomic number is sometimes written as a subscript preceding the
symbol, but since this number defines the element’s identity, as does its symbol, it is often omitted. For example,
magnesium exists as a mixture of three isotopes, each with an atomic number of 12 and with mass numbers of
24, 25, and 26, respectively. These isotopes can be identified as 24Mg, 25Mg, and 26Mg. These isotope symbols are
read as “element, mass number” and can be symbolized consistent with this reading. For instance, 24Mg is read as
“magnesium 24,” and can be written as “magnesium-24” or “Mg-24.” 25Mg is read as “magnesium 25,” and can be
written as “magnesium-25” or “Mg-25.” All magnesium atoms have 12 protons in their nucleus. They differ only
because a 24Mg atom has 12 neutrons in its nucleus, a 25Mg atom has 13 neutrons, and a 26Mg has 14 neutrons.
Figure 2.14 The symbol for an atom indicates the element via its usual two-letter symbol, the mass number as a left
superscript, the atomic number as a left subscript (sometimes omitted), and the charge as a right superscript.
Information about the naturally occurring isotopes of elements with atomic numbers 1 through 10 is given in Table
2.4. Note that in addition to standard names and symbols, the isotopes of hydrogen are often referred to using
common names and accompanying symbols. Hydrogen-2, symbolized 2H, is also called deuterium and sometimes
symbolized D. Hydrogen-3, symbolized 3H, is also called tritium and sometimes symbolized T.

Atomic Mass
Because each proton and each neutron contribute approximately one amu to the mass of an atom, and each electron
contributes far less, the atomic mass of a single atom is approximately equal to its mass number (a whole number).
However, the average masses of atoms of most elements are not whole numbers because most elements exist naturally
as mixtures of two or more isotopes.
The mass of an element shown in a periodic table or listed in a table of atomic masses is a weighted, average mass
of all the isotopes present in a naturally occurring sample of that element. This is equal to the sum of each individual
isotope’s mass multiplied by its fractional abundance.
average mass = ∑
i
(fractional abundance × isotopic mass)i
For example, the element boron is composed of two isotopes: About 19.9% of all boron atoms are 10B with a mass of
10.0129 amu, and the remaining 80.1% are 11B with a mass of 11.0093 amu. The average atomic mass for boron is
calculated to be:
boron average mass = (0.199 × 10.0129 amu) + (0.801 × 11.0093 amu)
= 1.99 amu + 8.82 amu
= 10.81 amu
It is important to understand that no single boron atom weighs exactly 10.8 amu; 10.8 amu is the average mass of all
boron atoms, and individual boron atoms weigh either approximately 10 amu or 11 amu.
Example 2.4
Calculation of Average Atomic Mass
A meteorite found in central Indiana contains traces of the noble gas neon picked up from the solar wind
during the meteorite’s trip through the solar system. Analysis of a sample of the gas showed that it consisted
of 91.84% 20Ne (mass 19.9924 amu), 0.47% 21Ne (mass 20.9940 amu), and 7.69% 22Ne (mass 21.9914
amu). What is the average mass of the neon in the solar wind?
Solution
average mass = (0.9184 × 19.9924 amu) + (0.0047 × 20.9940 amu) + (0.0769 × 21.9914 amu)
= (18.36 + 0.099 + 1.69) amu
= 20.15 amu
The average mass of a neon atom in the solar wind is 20.15 amu. (The average mass of a terrestrial neon
atom is 20.1796 amu. This result demonstrates that we may find slight differences in the natural abundance
of isotopes, depending on their origin.)

We can also do variations of this type of calculation, as shown in the next example.

Naturally occurring chlorine consists of 35Cl (mass 34.96885 amu) and 37Cl (mass 36.96590 amu), with an
average mass of 35.453 amu. What is the percent composition of Cl in terms of these two isotopes?
Solution
The average mass of chlorine is the fraction that is 35Cl times the mass of 35Cl plus the fraction that is 37Cl
times the mass of 37Cl.
average mass = (fraction of 35 Cl × mass of 35 Cl) + (fraction of 37 Cl × mass of 37 Cl)
If we let x represent the fraction that is 35Cl, then the fraction that is 37Cl is represented by 1.00 − x.
(The fraction that is 35Cl + the fraction that is 37Cl must add up to 1, so the fraction of 37Cl must equal 1.00
− the fraction of 35Cl.)
Substituting this into the average mass equation, we have:
35.453 amu = (x × 34.96885 amu) + [(1.00 − x) × 36.96590 amu]
35.453 = 34.96885x + 36.96590 − 36.96590x
1.99705x = 1.513
x = 1.513
1.99705 = 0.7576
So solving yields: x = 0.7576, which means that 1.00 − 0.7576 = 0.2424. Therefore, chlorine consists of
75.76% 35Cl and 24.24% 37Cl.

The occurrence and natural abundances of isotopes can be experimentally determined using an instrument called

mass spectrometer (Figure 2.15), the sample is vaporized and exposed to a high-energy electron beam that causes
the sample’s atoms (or molecules) to become electrically charged, typically by losing one or more electrons. These
cations then pass through a (variable) electric or magnetic field that deflects each cation’s path to an extent that
depends on both its mass and charge (similar to how the path of a large steel ball bearing rolling past a magnet is
deflected to a lesser extent that that of a small steel BB). The ions are detected, and a plot of the relative number of
ions generated versus their mass-to-charge ratios (a mass spectrum) is made. The height of each vertical feature or
peak in a mass spectrum is proportional to the fraction of cations with the specified mass-to-charge ratio. Since its
initial use during the development of modern atomic theory, MS has evolved to become a powerful tool for chemical
analysis in a wide range of applications.

2.4 Chemical Formulas
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Symbolize the composition of molecules using molecular formulas and empirical formulas
• Represent the bonding arrangement of atoms within molecules using structural formulas
A molecular formula is a representation of a molecule that uses chemical symbols to indicate the types of atoms
followed by subscripts to show the number of atoms of each type in the molecule. (A subscript is used only when
more than one atom of a given type is present.) Molecular formulas are also used as abbreviations for the names of
compounds.
Link to Learning
Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 87
The structural formula for a compound gives the same information as its molecular formula (the types and numbers
of atoms in the molecule) but also shows how the atoms are connected in the molecule. The structural formula for
methane contains symbols for one C atom and four H atoms, indicating the number of atoms in the molecule (Figure
2.16). The lines represent bonds that hold the atoms together. (A chemical bond is an attraction between atoms or
ions that holds them together in a molecule or a crystal.) We will discuss chemical bonds and see how to predict the
arrangement of atoms in a molecule later. For now, simply know that the lines are an indication of how the atoms are
connected in a molecule. A ball-and-stick model shows the geometric arrangement of the atoms with atomic sizes not
to scale, and a space-filling model shows the relative sizes of the atoms.
Figure 2.16 A methane molecule can be represented as (a) a molecular formula, (b) a structural formula, (c) a ball-
and-stick model, and (d) a space-filling model. Carbon and hydrogen atoms are represented by black and white
spheres, respectively.
Although many elements consist of discrete, individual atoms, some exist as molecules made up of two or more
atoms of the element chemically bonded together. For example, most samples of the elements hydrogen, oxygen,
and nitrogen are composed of molecules that contain two atoms each (called diatomic molecules) and thus have the
molecular formulas H2, O2, and N2, respectively. Other elements commonly found as diatomic molecules are fluorine
(F2), chlorine (Cl2), bromine (Br2), and iodine (I2). The most common form of the element sulfur is composed of
molecules that consist of eight atoms of sulfur; its molecular formula is S8 (Figure 2.17).
Figure 2.17 A molecule of sulfur is composed of eight sulfur atoms and is therefore written as S8. It can be
represented as (a) a structural formula, (b) a ball-and-stick model, and (c) a space-filling model. Sulfur atoms are
represented by yellow spheres.
It is important to note that a subscript following a symbol and a number in front of a symbol do not represent the
same thing; for example, H2 and 2H represent distinctly different species. H2 is a molecular formula; it represents
a diatomic molecule of hydrogen, consisting of two atoms of the element that are chemically bonded together. The
expression 2H, on the other hand, indicates two separate hydrogen atoms that are not combined as a unit. The
expression 2H2 represents two molecules of diatomic hydrogen (Figure 2.18).

Figure 2.18 The symbols H, 2H, H2, and 2H2 represent very different entities.
Compounds are formed when two or more elements chemically combine, resulting in the formation of bonds. For
example, hydrogen and oxygen can react to form water, and sodium and chlorine can react to form table salt. We
sometimes describe the composition of these compounds with an empirical formula, which indicates the types of
atoms present and the simplest whole-number ratio of the number of atoms (or ions) in the compound. For example,
titanium dioxide (used as pigment in white paint and in the thick, white, blocking type of sunscreen) has an empirical
formula of TiO2. This identifies the elements titanium (Ti) and oxygen (O) as the constituents of titanium dioxide,
and indicates the presence of twice as many atoms of the element oxygen as atoms of the element titanium (Figure
2.19).
Figure 2.19 (a) The white compound titanium dioxide provides effective protection from the sun. (b) A crystal of
titanium dioxide, TiO2, contains titanium and oxygen in a ratio of 1 to 2. The titanium atoms are gray and the oxygen
atoms are red. (credit a: modification of work by “osseous”/Flickr)
As discussed previously, we can describe a compound with a molecular formula, in which the subscripts indicate
the actual numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. In many cases, the molecular formula
of a substance is derived from experimental determination of both its empirical formula and its molecular mass (the
sum of atomic masses for all atoms composing the molecule). For example, it can be determined experimentally that
benzene contains two elements, carbon (C) and hydrogen (H), and that for every carbon atom in benzene, there is one
hydrogen atom. Thus, the empirical formula is CH. An experimental determination of the molecular mass reveals that
a molecule of benzene contains six carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms, so the molecular formula for benzene is
C6H6 (Figure 2.20).
Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 89
Figure 2.20 Benzene, C6H6, is produced during oil refining and has many industrial uses. A benzene molecule can
be represented as (a) a structural formula, (b) a ball-and-stick model, and (c) a space-filling model. (d) Benzene is a

If we know a compound’s formula, we can easily determine the empirical formula. (This is somewhat of an academic
exercise; the reverse chronology is generally followed in actual practice.) For example, the molecular formula for
acetic acid, the component that gives vinegar its sharp taste, is C2H4O2. This formula indicates that a molecule of
acetic acid (Figure 2.21) contains two carbon atoms, four hydrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms. The ratio of
atoms is 2:4:2. Dividing by the lowest common denominator (2) gives the simplest, whole-number ratio of atoms,
1:2:1, so the empirical formula is CH2O. Note that a molecular formula is always a whole-number multiple of an
empirical formula.

Solution
The molecular formula is C6H12O6 because one molecule actually contains 6 C, 12 H, and 6 O atoms. The
simplest whole-number ratio of C to H to O atoms in glucose is 1:2:1, so the empirical formula is CH2O.

Lee Cronin
What is it that chemists do? According to Lee Cronin (Figure 2.22), chemists make very complicated
molecules by “chopping up” small molecules and “reverse engineering” them. He wonders if we could “make a
really cool universal chemistry set” by what he calls “app-ing” chemistry. Could we “app” chemistry?
In a 2012 TED talk, Lee describes one fascinating possibility: combining a collection of chemical “inks” with
a 3D printer capable of fabricating a reaction apparatus (tiny test tubes, beakers, and the like) to fashion
a “universal toolkit of chemistry.” This toolkit could be used to create custom-tailored drugs to fight a new
superbug or to “print” medicine personally configured to your genetic makeup, environment, and health
situation. Says Cronin, “What Apple did for music, I’d like to do for the discovery and distribution of prescription
drugs.”[2] View his full talk (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16LeeCronin) at the TED website.

It is important to be aware that it may be possible for the same atoms to be arranged in different ways: Compounds
with the same molecular formula may have different atom-to-atom bonding and therefore different structures. For
example, could there be another compound with the same formula as acetic acid, C2H4O2? And if so, what would be
the structure of its molecules?
If you predict that another compound with the formula C2H4O2 could exist, then you demonstrated good chemical
insight and are correct. Two C atoms, four H atoms, and two O atoms can also be arranged to form a methyl formate,
which is used in manufacturing, as an insecticide, and for quick-drying finishes. Methyl formate molecules have
one of the oxygen atoms between the two carbon atoms, differing from the arrangement in acetic acid molecules.
Acetic acid and methyl formate are examples of isomers—compounds with the same chemical formula but different
molecular structures (Figure 2.23). Note that this small difference in the arrangement of the atoms has a major
effect on their respective chemical properties. You would certainly not want to use a solution of methyl formate as a
substitute for a solution of acetic acid (vinegar) when you make salad dressing.

Many types of isomers exist (Figure 2.24). Acetic acid and methyl formate are structural isomers, compounds in
which the molecules differ in how the atoms are connected to each other. There are also various types of spatial
isomers, in which the relative orientations of the atoms in space can be different. For example, the compound carvone
(found in caraway seeds, spearmint, and mandarin orange peels) consists of two isomers that are mirror images of
each other. S-(+)-carvone smells like caraway, and R-(−)-carvone smells like spearmint.

2.5 The Periodic Table
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• State the periodic law and explain the organization of elements in the periodic table
• Predict the general properties of elements based on their location within the periodic table
• Identify metals, nonmetals, and metalloids by their properties and/or location on the periodic table
As early chemists worked to purify ores and discovered more elements, they realized that various elements could
be grouped together by their similar chemical behaviors. One such grouping includes lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and
potassium (K): These elements all are shiny, conduct heat and electricity well, and have similar chemical properties.
A second grouping includes calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), and barium (Ba), which also are shiny, good conductors of
heat and electricity, and have chemical properties in common. However, the specific properties of these two groupings
are notably different from each other. For example: Li, Na, and K are much more reactive than are Ca, Sr, and Ba; Li,
Na, and K form compounds with oxygen in a ratio of two of their atoms to one oxygen atom, whereas Ca, Sr, and Ba
form compounds with one of their atoms to one oxygen atom. Fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine
(I) also exhibit similar properties to each other, but these properties are drastically different from those of any of the
elements above.
Dimitri Mendeleev in Russia (1869) and Lothar Meyer in Germany (1870) independently recognized that there was a
periodic relationship among the properties of the elements known at that time. Both published tables with the elements
arranged according to increasing atomic mass. But Mendeleev went one step further than Meyer: He used his table
to predict the existence of elements that would have the properties similar to aluminum and silicon, but were yet
unknown. The discoveries of gallium (1875) and germanium (1886) provided great support for Mendeleev’s work.
Although Mendeleev and Meyer had a long dispute over priority, Mendeleev’s contributions to the development of
the periodic table are now more widely recognized (Figure 2.25).

By the twentieth century, it became apparent that the periodic relationship involved atomic numbers rather than
atomic masses. The modern statement of this relationship, the periodic law, is as follows: the properties of the
elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers. A modern periodic table arranges the elements in increasing
order of their atomic numbers and groups atoms with similar properties in the same vertical column (Figure 2.26).
Each box represents an element and contains its atomic number, symbol, average atomic mass, and (sometimes) name.
The elements are arranged in seven horizontal rows, called periods or series, and 18 vertical columns, called groups.
Groups are labeled at the top of each column. In the United States, the labels traditionally were numerals with capital
letters. However, IUPAC recommends that the numbers 1 through 18 be used, and these labels are more common. For
the table to fit on a single page, parts of two of the rows, a total of 14 columns, are usually written below the main
body of the table.
Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 95
Figure 2.26 Elements in the periodic table are organized according to their properties.
Many elements differ dramatically in their chemical and physical properties, but some elements are similar in their
behaviors. For example, many elements appear shiny, are malleable (able to be deformed without breaking) and
ductile (can be drawn into wires), and conduct heat and electricity well. Other elements are not shiny, malleable, or
ductile, and are poor conductors of heat and electricity. We can sort the elements into large classes with common
properties: metals (elements that are shiny, malleable, good conductors of heat and electricity—shaded yellow);
nonmetals (elements that appear dull, poor conductors of heat and electricity—shaded green); and metalloids
(elements that conduct heat and electricity moderately well, and possess some properties of metals and some
properties of nonmetals—shaded purple).
The elements can also be classified into the main-group elements (or representative elements) in the columns
labeled 1, 2, and 13–18; the transition metals in the columns labeled 3–12[3]; and inner transition metals in the
two rows at the bottom of the table (the top-row elements are called lanthanides and the bottom-row elements are
actinides; Figure 2.27). The elements can be subdivided further by more specific properties, such as the composition
of the compounds they form. For example, the elements in group 1 (the first column) form compounds that consist
of one atom of the element and one atom of hydrogen. These elements (except hydrogen) are known as alkali
metals, and they all have similar chemical properties. The elements in group 2 (the second column) form compounds
consisting of one atom of the element and two atoms of hydrogen: These are called alkaline earth metals, with
3. Per the IUPAC definition, group 12 elements are not transition metals, though they are often referred to as such. Additional details on this
group’s elements are provided in a chapter on transition metals and coordination chemistry.

similar properties among members of that group. Other groups with specific names are the pnictogens (group 15),
chalcogens (group 16), halogens (group 17), and the noble gases (group 18, also known as inert gases). The groups
can also be referred to by the first element of the group: For example, the chalcogens can be called the oxygen group
or oxygen family. Hydrogen is a unique, nonmetallic element with properties similar to both group 1 and group 17
elements. For that reason, hydrogen may be shown at the top of both groups, or by itself.

In studying the periodic table, you might have noticed something about the atomic masses of some of the elements.
Element 43 (technetium), element 61 (promethium), and most of the elements with atomic number 84 (polonium)
and higher have their atomic mass given in square brackets. This is done for elements that consist entirely of
unstable, radioactive isotopes (you will learn more about radioactivity in the nuclear chemistry chapter). An average
atomic weight cannot be determined for these elements because their radioisotopes may vary significantly in relative
abundance, depending on the source, or may not even exist in nature. The number in square brackets is the atomic
mass number (an approximate atomic mass) of the most stable isotope of that element.
2.6 Molecular and Ionic Compounds
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define ionic and molecular (covalent) compounds
• Predict the type of compound formed from elements based on their location within the periodic table
• Determine formulas for simple ionic compounds
In ordinary chemical reactions, the nucleus of each atom (and thus the identity of the element) remains unchanged.
Electrons, however, can be added to atoms by transfer from other atoms, lost by transfer to other atoms, or shared
with other atoms. The transfer and sharing of electrons among atoms govern the chemistry of the elements. During
the formation of some compounds, atoms gain or lose electrons, and form electrically charged particles called ions
(Figure 2.28).
98 Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Figure 2.28 (a) A sodium atom (Na) has equal numbers of protons and electrons (11) and is uncharged. (b) A
sodium cation (Na+) has lost an electron, so it has one more proton (11) than electrons (10), giving it an overall
positive charge, signified by a superscripted plus sign.
You can use the periodic table to predict whether an atom will form an anion or a cation, and you can often predict
the charge of the resulting ion. Atoms of many main-group metals lose enough electrons to leave them with the same
number of electrons as an atom of the preceding noble gas. To illustrate, an atom of an alkali metal (group 1) loses
one electron and forms a cation with a 1+ charge; an alkaline earth metal (group 2) loses two electrons and forms a
cation with a 2+ charge, and so on. For example, a neutral calcium atom, with 20 protons and 20 electrons, readily
loses two electrons. This results in a cation with 20 protons, 18 electrons, and a 2+ charge. It has the same number of
electrons as atoms of the preceding noble gas, argon, and is symbolized Ca2+. The name of a metal ion is the same as
the name of the metal atom from which it forms, so Ca2+ is called a calcium ion.
When atoms of nonmetal elements form ions, they generally gain enough electrons to give them the same number of
electrons as an atom of the next noble gas in the periodic table. Atoms of group 17 gain one electron and form anions
with a 1− charge; atoms of group 16 gain two electrons and form ions with a 2− charge, and so on. For example, the
neutral bromine atom, with 35 protons and 35 electrons, can gain one electron to provide it with 36 electrons. This
results in an anion with 35 protons, 36 electrons, and a 1− charge. It has the same number of electrons as atoms of the
next noble gas, krypton, and is symbolized Br−. (A discussion of the theory supporting the favored status of noble gas
electron numbers reflected in these predictive rules for ion formation is provided in a later chapter of this text.)
Note the usefulness of the periodic table in predicting likely ion formation and charge (Figure 2.29). Moving from
the far left to the right on the periodic table, main-group elements tend to form cations with a charge equal to the
group number. That is, group 1 elements form 1+ ions; group 2 elements form 2+ ions, and so on. Moving from the
far right to the left on the periodic table, elements often form anions with a negative charge equal to the number of
groups moved left from the noble gases. For example, group 17 elements (one group left of the noble gases) form 1−
ions; group 16 elements (two groups left) form 2− ions, and so on. This trend can be used as a guide in many cases,
but its predictive value decreases when moving toward the center of the periodic table. In fact, transition metals and
some other metals often exhibit variable charges that are not predictable by their location in the table. For example,
copper can form ions with a 1+ or 2+ charge, and iron can form ions with a 2+ or 3+ charge.
Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 99
Figure 2.29 Some elements exhibit a regular pattern of ionic charge when they form ions.
Example 2.8
Composition of Ions
An ion found in some compounds used as antiperspirants contains 13 protons and 10 electrons. What is its
symbol?
Solution
Because the number of protons remains unchanged when an atom forms an ion, the atomic number of the
element must be 13. Knowing this lets us use the periodic table to identify the element as Al (aluminum).
The Al atom has lost three electrons and thus has three more positive charges (13) than it has electrons (10).
This is the aluminum cation, Al3+.

Solution
Magnesium’s position in the periodic table (group 2) tells us that it is a metal. Metals form positive ions
(cations). A magnesium atom must lose two electrons to have the same number electrons as an atom of the
previous noble gas, neon. Thus, a magnesium atom will form a cation with two fewer electrons than protons
and a charge of 2+. The symbol for the ion is Mg2+, and it is called a magnesium ion.
Nitrogen’s position in the periodic table (group 15) reveals that it is a nonmetal. Nonmetals form negative
ions (anions). A nitrogen atom must gain three electrons to have the same number of electrons as an atom
of the following noble gas, neon. Thus, a nitrogen atom will form an anion with three more electrons than
protons and a charge of 3−. The symbol for the ion is N3−, and it is called a nitride ion.

The ions that we have discussed so far are called monatomic ions, that is, they are ions formed from only one atom.
We also find many polyatomic ions. These ions, which act as discrete units, are electrically charged molecules (a
group of bonded atoms with an overall charge). Some of the more important polyatomic ions are listed in Table 2.5.
Oxyanions are polyatomic ions that contain one or more oxygen atoms. At this point in your study of chemistry, you
should memorize the names, formulas, and charges of the most common polyatomic ions. Because you will use them
repeatedly, they will soon become familiar.

Note that there is a system for naming some polyatomic ions; -ate and -ite are suffixes designating polyatomic ions
containing more or fewer oxygen atoms. Per- (short for “hyper”) and hypo- (meaning “under”) are prefixes meaning
more oxygen atoms than -ate and fewer oxygen atoms than -ite, respectively. For example, perchlorate is ClO4 − ,
chlorate is ClO3 − , chlorite is ClO2 − and hypochlorite is ClO−. Unfortunately, the number of oxygen atoms
corresponding to a given suffix or prefix is not consistent; for example, nitrate is NO3 − while sulfate is SO4 2−.
This will be covered in more detail in the next module on nomenclature.
The nature of the attractive forces that hold atoms or ions together within a compound is the basis for classifying
chemical bonding. When electrons are transferred and ions form, ionic bonds result. Ionic bonds are electrostatic
forces of attraction, that is, the attractive forces experienced between objects of opposite electrical charge (in this case,
cations and anions). When electrons are “shared” and molecules form, covalent bonds result. Covalent bonds are the
attractive forces between the positively charged nuclei of the bonded atoms and one or more pairs of electrons that
are located between the atoms. Compounds are classified as ionic or molecular (covalent) on the basis of the bonds
present in them.
Ionic Compounds
When an element composed of atoms that readily lose electrons (a metal) reacts with an element composed of atoms
that readily gain electrons (a nonmetal), a transfer of electrons usually occurs, producing ions. The compound formed
by this transfer is stabilized by the electrostatic attractions (ionic bonds) between the ions of opposite charge present
in the compound. For example, when each sodium atom in a sample of sodium metal (group 1) gives up one electron
to form a sodium cation, Na+, and each chlorine atom in a sample of chlorine gas (group 17) accepts one electron to
form a chloride anion, Cl−, the resulting compound, NaCl, is composed of sodium ions and chloride ions in the ratio
of one Na+ ion for each Cl− ion. Similarly, each calcium atom (group 2) can give up two electrons and transfer one
102 Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
to each of two chlorine atoms to form CaCl2, which is composed of Ca2+ and Cl− ions in the ratio of one Ca2+ ion to
two Cl− ions.
A compound that contains ions and is held together by ionic bonds is called an ionic compound. The periodic table
can help us recognize many of the compounds that are ionic: When a metal is combined with one or more nonmetals,
the compound is usually ionic. This guideline works well for predicting ionic compound formation for most of the
compounds typically encountered in an introductory chemistry course. However, it is not always true (for example,
aluminum chloride, AlCl3, is not ionic).
You can often recognize ionic compounds because of their properties. Ionic compounds are solids that typically melt
at high temperatures and boil at even higher temperatures. For example, sodium chloride melts at 801 °C and boils
at 1413 °C. (As a comparison, the molecular compound water melts at 0 °C and boils at 100 °C.) In solid form, an
ionic compound is not electrically conductive because its ions are unable to flow (“electricity” is the flow of charged
particles). When molten, however, it can conduct electricity because its ions are able to move freely through the liquid
(Figure 2.30).

Mark Blaser and Matt Evans)
Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16moltensalt) to see a mixture of salts melt and conduct
electricity.
In every ionic compound, the total number of positive charges of the cations equals the total number of negative
charges of the anions. Thus, ionic compounds are electrically neutral overall, even though they contain positive and
negative ions. We can use this observation to help us write the formula of an ionic compound. The formula of an ionic
compound must have a ratio of ions such that the numbers of positive and negative charges are equal.

Solution
Because the ionic compound must be electrically neutral, it must have the same number of positive and
negative charges. Two aluminum ions, each with a charge of 3+, would give us six positive charges, and
three oxide ions, each with a charge of 2−, would give us six negative charges. The formula would be Al2O3.

Predict the formula of the ionic compound formed between the sodium cation, Na+, and the sulfide anion,
S2−.
Answer: Na2S
Many ionic compounds contain polyatomic ions (Table 2.5) as the cation, the anion, or both. As with simple ionic
compounds, these compounds must also be electrically neutral, so their formulas can be predicted by treating the
polyatomic ions as discrete units. We use parentheses in a formula to indicate a group of atoms that behave as a
unit. For example, the formula for calcium phosphate, one of the minerals in our bones, is Ca3(PO4)2. This formula
indicates that there are three calcium ions (Ca2+) for every two phosphate (PO4 3−) groups. The PO4 3− groups are
discrete units, each consisting of one phosphorus atom and four oxygen atoms, and having an overall charge of 3−.
The compound is electrically neutral, and its formula shows a total count of three Ca, two P, and eight O atoms.
Example 2.11
Predicting the Formula of a Compound with a Polyatomic Anion
Baking powder contains calcium dihydrogen phosphate, an ionic compound composed of the ions Ca2+ and
H2 PO4 − . What is the formula of this compound?
Solution
The positive and negative charges must balance, and this ionic compound must be electrically neutral. Thus,
we must have two negative charges to balance the 2+ charge of the calcium ion. This requires a ratio of one
Ca2+ ion to two H2 PO4 − ions. We designate this by enclosing the formula for the dihydrogen phosphate
ion in parentheses and adding a subscript 2. The formula is Ca(H2PO4)2.

Answer: Li2O2
Because an ionic compound is not made up of single, discrete molecules, it may not be properly symbolized using
a molecular formula. Instead, ionic compounds must be symbolized by a formula indicating the relative numbers
104 Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
of its constituent ions. For compounds containing only monatomic ions (such as NaCl) and for many compounds
containing polyatomic ions (such as CaSO4), these formulas are just the empirical formulas introduced earlier in this
chapter. However, the formulas for some ionic compounds containing polyatomic ions are not empirical formulas.
For example, the ionic compound sodium oxalate is comprised of Na+ and C2 O4 2− ions combined in a 2:1 ratio,
and its formula is written as Na2C2O4. The subscripts in this formula are not the smallest-possible whole numbers, as
each can be divided by 2 to yield the empirical formula, NaCO2. This is not the accepted formula for sodium oxalate,
however, as it does not accurately represent the compound’s polyatomic anion, C2 O4 2−.
Molecular Compounds
Many compounds do not contain ions but instead consist solely of discrete, neutral molecules. These molecular
compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent
bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later
chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under
normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although
many important exceptions exist.
Whereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually
formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are
covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound’s elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic
or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does
not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds,
and you’ll learn more about those later.

2.7 Chemical Nomenclature
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
• Derive names for common types of inorganic compounds using a systematic approach
Nomenclature, a collection of rules for naming things, is important in science and in many other situations. This
module describes an approach that is used to name simple ionic and molecular compounds, such as NaCl, CaCO3, and
N2O4. The simplest of these are binary compounds, those containing only two elements, but we will also consider
how to name ionic compounds containing polyatomic ions, and one specific, very important class of compounds
known as acids (subsequent chapters in this text will focus on these compounds in great detail). We will limit our
attention here to inorganic compounds, compounds that are composed principally of elements other than carbon, and
will follow the nomenclature guidelines proposed by IUPAC. The rules for organic compounds, in which carbon is
the principle element, will be treated in a later chapter on organic chemistry.
Ionic Compounds
To name an inorganic compound, we need to consider the answers to several questions. First, is the compound ionic or
molecular? If the compound is ionic, does the metal form ions of only one type (fixed charge) or more than one type
(variable charge)? Are the ions monatomic or polyatomic? If the compound is molecular, does it contain hydrogen? If
so, does it also contain oxygen? From the answers we derive, we place the compound in an appropriate category and
then name it accordingly.
Compounds Containing Only Monatomic Ions
The name of a binary compound containing monatomic ions consists of the name of the cation (the name of the metal)
followed by the name of the anion (the name of the nonmetallic element with its ending replaced by the suffix –ide).
Some examples are given in Table 2.6.
Names of Some Ionic Compounds
NaCl, sodium chloride Na2O, sodium oxide
KBr, potassium bromide CdS, cadmium sulfide
CaI2, calcium iodide Mg3N2, magnesium nitride
CsF, cesium fluoride Ca3P2, calcium phosphide
LiCl, lithium chloride Al4C3, aluminum carbide
Table 2.6
Compounds Containing Polyatomic Ions
Compounds containing polyatomic ions are named similarly to those containing only monatomic ions, i.e. by naming
first the cation and then the anion. Examples are shown in Table 2.7.

Compounds Containing a Metal Ion with a Variable Charge
Most of the transition metals and some main group metals can form two or more cations with different charges.
Compounds of these metals with nonmetals are named with the same method as compounds in the first category,
except the charge of the metal ion is specified by a Roman numeral in parentheses after the name of the metal. The
Chemistry in Everyday Life
Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 107
charge of the metal ion is determined from the formula of the compound and the charge of the anion. For example,
consider binary ionic compounds of iron and chlorine. Iron typically exhibits a charge of either 2+ or 3+ (see Figure
2.29), and the two corresponding compound formulas are FeCl2 and FeCl3. The simplest name, “iron chloride,” will,
in this case, be ambiguous, as it does not distinguish between these two compounds. In cases like this, the charge
of the metal ion is included as a Roman numeral in parentheses immediately following the metal name. These two
compounds are then unambiguously named iron(II) chloride and iron(III) chloride, respectively. Other examples are
provided in Table 2.9.
Some Ionic Compounds with Variably Charged Metal Ions
Compound Name
FeCl2 iron(II) chloride
FeCl3 iron(III) chloride
Hg2O mercury(I) oxide
HgO mercury(II) oxide
SnF2 tin(II) fluoride
SnF4 tin(IV) fluoride
Table 2.9
Out-of-date nomenclature used the suffixes –ic and –ous to designate metals with higher and lower charges,
respectively: Iron(III) chloride, FeCl3, was previously called ferric chloride, and iron(II) chloride, FeCl2, was known
as ferrous chloride. Though this naming convention has been largely abandoned by the scientific community, it
remains in use by some segments of industry. For example, you may see the words stannous fluoride on a tube of
toothpaste. This represents the formula SnF2, which is more properly named tin(II) fluoride. The other fluoride of tin
is SnF4, which was previously called stannic fluoride but is now named tin(IV) fluoride.
Ionic Hydrates
Ionic compounds that contain water molecules as integral components of their crystals are called hydrates. The name
for an ionic hydrate is derived by adding a term to the name for the anhydrous (meaning “not hydrated”) compound
that indicates the number of water molecules associated with each formula unit of the compound. The added word
begins with a Greek prefix denoting the number of water molecules (see Table 2.10) and ends with “hydrate.”
For example, the anhydrous compound copper(II) sulfate also exists as a hydrate containing five water molecules
and named copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate. Washing soda is the common name for a hydrate of sodium carbonate
containing 10 water molecules; the systematic name is sodium carbonate decahydrate.
Formulas for ionic hydrates are written by appending a vertically centered dot, a coefficient representing the number
of water molecules, and the formula for water. The two examples mentioned in the previous paragraph are represented
by the formulas
copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate CuSO4 ∙5H2 O
sodium carbonate decahydrate Na2 CO3 ∙10H2 O

Erin Brokovich and Chromium Contamination
In the early 1990s, legal file clerk Erin Brockovich (Figure 2.32) discovered a high rate of serious illnesses
in the small town of Hinckley, California. Her investigation eventually linked the illnesses to groundwater
contaminated by Cr(VI) used by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) to fight corrosion in a nearby natural gas
pipeline. As dramatized in the film Erin Brokovich (for which Julia Roberts won an Oscar), Erin and lawyer
Edward Masry sued PG&E for contaminating the water near Hinckley in 1993. The settlement they won in
1996—$333 million—was the largest amount ever awarded for a direct-action lawsuit in the US at that time.
Figure 2.32 (a) Erin Brockovich found that Cr(VI), used by PG&E, had contaminated the Hinckley,
California, water supply. (b) The Cr(VI) ion is often present in water as the polyatomic ions chromate,
CrO4 2− (left), and dichromate, Cr2 O7 2− (right).
Chromium compounds are widely used in industry, such as for chrome plating, in dye-making, as
preservatives, and to prevent corrosion in cooling tower water, as occurred near Hinckley. In the environment,
chromium exists primarily in either the Cr(III) or Cr(VI) forms. Cr(III), an ingredient of many vitamin and
nutritional supplements, forms compounds that are not very soluble in water, and it has low toxicity. But Cr(VI)
is much more toxic and forms compounds that are reasonably soluble in water. Exposure to small amounts of
Cr(VI) can lead to damage of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and immune systems, as well as the kidneys,
liver, blood, and skin.
Despite cleanup efforts, Cr(VI) groundwater contamination remains a problem in Hinckley and other locations
across the globe. A 2010 study by the Environmental Working Group found that of 35 US cities tested, 31 had
higher levels of Cr(VI) in their tap water than the public health goal of 0.02 parts per billion set by the California
Environmental Protection Agency.
Molecular (Covalent) Compounds
The bonding characteristics of inorganic molecular compounds are different from ionic compounds, and they are
named using a different system as well. The charges of cations and anions dictate their ratios in ionic compounds, so
specifying the names of the ions provides sufficient information to determine chemical formulas. However, because
covalent bonding allows for significant variation in the combination ratios of the atoms in a molecule, the names for
molecular compounds must explicitly identify these ratios.

Compounds Composed of Two Elements
When two nonmetallic elements form a molecular compound, several combination ratios are often possible. For
example, carbon and oxygen can form the compounds CO and CO2. Since these are different substances with different
properties, they cannot both have the same name (they cannot both be called carbon oxide). To deal with this situation,
we use a naming method that is somewhat similar to that used for ionic compounds, but with added prefixes to specify
the numbers of atoms of each element. The name of the more metallic element (the one farther to the left and/or
bottom of the periodic table) is first, followed by the name of the more nonmetallic element (the one farther to the
right and/or top) with its ending changed to the suffix –ide. The numbers of atoms of each element are designated by
the Greek prefixes shown in Table 2.10.
When only one atom of the first element is present, the prefix mono- is usually deleted from that part. Thus, CO is
named carbon monoxide, and CO2 is called carbon dioxide. When two vowels are adjacent, the a in the Greek prefix
is usually dropped. Some other examples are shown in Table 2.11.
Names of Some Molecular Compounds Composed of Two Elements
Compound Name Compound Name
SO2 sulfur dioxide BCl3 boron trichloride
SO3 sulfur trioxide SF6 sulfur hexafluoride
NO2 nitrogen dioxide PF5 phosphorus pentafluoride
N2O4 dinitrogen tetroxide P4O10 tetraphosphorus decaoxide
N2O5 dinitrogen pentoxide IF7 iodine heptafluoride
Table 2.11
There are a few common names that you will encounter as you continue your study of chemistry. For example,
although NO is often called nitric oxide, its proper name is nitrogen monoxide. Similarly, N2O is known as nitrous
oxide even though our rules would specify the name dinitrogen monoxide. (And H2O is usually called water, not
dihydrogen monoxide.) You should commit to memory the common names of compounds as you encounter them.

The following website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16chemcompname) provides practice with naming
chemical compounds and writing chemical formulas. You can choose binary, polyatomic, and variable
charge ionic compounds, as well as molecular compounds.
Binary Acids
Some compounds containing hydrogen are members of an important class of substances known as acids. The
chemistry of these compounds is explored in more detail in later chapters of this text, but for now, it will suffice to
note that many acids release hydrogen ions, H+, when dissolved in water. To denote this distinct chemical property, a
mixture of water with an acid is given a name derived from the compound’s name. If the compound is a binary acid
(comprised of hydrogen and one other nonmetallic element):
1. The word “hydrogen” is changed to the prefix hydro-
2. The other nonmetallic element name is modified by adding the suffix -ic
3. The word “acid” is added as a second word
For example, when the gas HCl (hydrogen chloride) is dissolved in water, the solution is called hydrochloric acid.
Several other examples of this nomenclature are shown in Table 2.12.
Names of Some Simple Acids
Name of Gas Name of Acid
HF(g), hydrogen fluoride HF(aq), hydrofluoric acid
HCl(g), hydrogen chloride HCl(aq), hydrochloric acid

Link to Learning

subject to specialized nomenclature rules that you will learn later. However, we will briefly discuss the important
compounds known as oxyacids, compounds that contain hydrogen, oxygen, and at least one other element, and
are bonded in such a way as to impart acidic properties to the compound (you will learn the details of this in a
later chapter). Typical oxyacids consist of hydrogen combined with a polyatomic, oxygen-containing ion. To name
oxyacids:
1. Omit “hydrogen”
2. Start with the root name of the anion
3. Replace –ate with –ic, or –ite with –ous
4. Add “acid”
For example, consider H2CO3 (which you might be tempted to call “hydrogen carbonate”). To name this correctly,
“hydrogen” is omitted; the –ate of carbonate is replace with –ic; and acid is added—so its name is carbonic acid.
Other examples are given in Table 2.13. There are some exceptions to the general naming method (e.g., H2SO4 is
called sulfuric acid, not sulfic acid, and H2SO3 is sulfurous, not sulfous, acid).

Summary
2.1 Early Ideas in Atomic Theory
The ancient Greeks proposed that matter consists of extremely small particles called atoms. Dalton postulated that
each element has a characteristic type of atom that differs in properties from atoms of all other elements, and that
atoms of different elements can combine in fixed, small, whole-number ratios to form compounds. Samples of a
particular compound all have the same elemental proportions by mass. When two elements form different compounds,
a given mass of one element will combine with masses of the other element in a small, whole-number ratio. During
any chemical change, atoms are neither created nor destroyed.
2.2 Evolution of Atomic Theory
Although no one has actually seen the inside of an atom, experiments have demonstrated much about atomic structure.
Thomson’s cathode ray tube showed that atoms contain small, negatively charged particles called electrons. Millikan
discovered that there is a fundamental electric charge—the charge of an electron. Rutherford’s gold foil experiment
showed that atoms have a small, dense, positively charged nucleus; the positively charged particles within the nucleus
are called protons. Chadwick discovered that the nucleus also contains neutral particles called neutrons. Soddy
demonstrated that atoms of the same element can differ in mass; these are called isotopes.
2.3 Atomic Structure and Symbolism
An atom consists of a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons. The nucleus contains protons and
neutrons; its diameter is about 100,000 times smaller than that of the atom. The mass of one atom is usually expressed
in atomic mass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic mass. An amu is defined as exactly 1
12 of the mass of
a carbon-12 atom and is equal to 1.6605 × 10−24 g.
Protons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of 1+ and a mass of 1.0073 amu. Neutrons are relatively heavy
particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087 amu. Electrons are light particles with a charge of 1− and a mass of
116 Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
0.00055 amu. The number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number (Z) and is the property that defines an
atom’s elemental identity. The sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number
and, expressed in amu, is approximately equal to the mass of the atom. An atom is neutral when it contains equal
numbers of electrons and protons.
Isotopes of an element are atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers; isotopes of an element,
therefore, differ from each other only in the number of neutrons within the nucleus. When a naturally occurring
element is composed of several isotopes, the atomic mass of the element represents the average of the masses of the
isotopes involved. A chemical symbol identifies the atoms in a substance using symbols, which are one-, two-, or
three-letter abbreviations for the atoms.
2.4 Chemical Formulas
A molecular formula uses chemical symbols and subscripts to indicate the exact numbers of different atoms in a
molecule or compound. An empirical formula gives the simplest, whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound. A
structural formula indicates the bonding arrangement of the atoms in the molecule. Ball-and-stick and space-filling
models show the geometric arrangement of atoms in a molecule. Isomers are compounds with the same molecular
formula but different arrangements of atoms.
2.5 The Periodic Table
The discovery of the periodic recurrence of similar properties among the elements led to the formulation of the
periodic table, in which the elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number in rows known as periods
and columns known as groups. Elements in the same group of the periodic table have similar chemical properties.
Elements can be classified as metals, metalloids, and nonmetals, or as a main-group elements, transition metals, and
inner transition metals. Groups are numbered 1–18 from left to right. The elements in group 1 are known as the alkali
metals; those in group 2 are the alkaline earth metals; those in 15 are the pnictogens; those in 16 are the chalcogens;
those in 17 are the halogens; and those in 18 are the noble gases.
2.6 Molecular and Ionic Compounds
Metals (particularly those in groups 1 and 2) tend to lose the number of electrons that would leave them with the
same number of electrons as in the preceding noble gas in the periodic table. By this means, a positively charged
ion is formed. Similarly, nonmetals (especially those in groups 16 and 17, and, to a lesser extent, those in Group 15)
can gain the number of electrons needed to provide atoms with the same number of electrons as in the next noble
gas in the periodic table. Thus, nonmetals tend to form negative ions. Positively charged ions are called cations, and
negatively charged ions are called anions. Ions can be either monatomic (containing only one atom) or polyatomic
(containing more than one atom).
Compounds that contain ions are called ionic compounds. Ionic compounds generally form from metals and
nonmetals. Compounds that do not contain ions, but instead consist of atoms bonded tightly together in molecules
(uncharged groups of atoms that behave as a single unit), are called covalent compounds. Covalent compounds
usually form from two nonmetals.
2.7 Chemical Nomenclature
Chemists use nomenclature rules to clearly name compounds. Ionic and molecular compounds are named using
somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a nonmetal. The name of
the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to –ide. For example,
K2O is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses
follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, FeCl2 is iron(II) chloride and FeCl3 is iron(III) chloride.
Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular
compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers
of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include SF6, sulfur hexafluoride, and N2O4,
dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special
nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the –ide suffix to –ic, and adding
Chapter 2 | Atoms, Molecules, and Ions 117
“acid;” HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (–ate to –ic and –ite to
–ous), and adding “acid;” H2CO3 is carbonic acid.

Turkey or the United States. Calculate the percent abundances leading to the two values of the average atomic

Introduction
Swimming pools have long been a popular means of recreation, exercise, and physical therapy. Since it is impractical
to refill large pools with fresh water on a frequent basis, pool water is regularly treated with chemicals to prevent
the growth of harmful bacteria and algae. Proper pool maintenance requires regular additions of various chemical
compounds in carefully measured amounts. For example, the relative amount of calcium ion, Ca2+, in the water should
be maintained within certain limits to prevent eye irritation and avoid damage to the pool bed and plumbing. To
maintain proper calcium levels, calcium cations are added to the water in the form of an ionic compound that also
contains anions; thus, it is necessary to know both the relative amount of Ca2+ in the compound and the volume of
water in the pool in order to achieve the proper calcium level. Quantitative aspects of the composition of substances
(such as the calcium-containing compound) and mixtures (such as the pool water) are the subject of this chapter.

3.1 Formula Mass and the Mole Concept
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Calculate formula masses for covalent and ionic compounds
• Define the amount unit mole and the related quantity Avogadro’s number Explain the relation between mass,
moles, and numbers of atoms or molecules, and perform calculations deriving these quantities from one
another
Many argue that modern chemical science began when scientists started exploring the quantitative as well as
the qualitative aspects of chemistry. For example, Dalton’s atomic theory was an attempt to explain the results
of measurements that allowed him to calculate the relative masses of elements combined in various compounds.
Understanding the relationship between the masses of atoms and the chemical formulas of compounds allows us to
quantitatively describe the composition of substances.
Formula Mass
An earlier chapter of this text described the development of the atomic mass unit, the concept of average atomic
masses, and the use of chemical formulas to represent the elemental makeup of substances. These ideas can be
extended to calculate the formula mass of a substance by summing the average atomic masses of all the atoms
represented in the substance’s formula.
Formula Mass for Covalent Substances
For covalent substances, the formula represents the numbers and types of atoms composing a single molecule of
the substance; therefore, the formula mass may be correctly referred to as a molecular mass. Consider chloroform
(CHCl3), a covalent compound once used as a surgical anesthetic and now primarily used in the production of
tetrafluoroethylene, the building block for the "anti-stick" polymer, Teflon. The molecular formula of chloroform
indicates that a single molecule contains one carbon atom, one hydrogen atom, and three chlorine atoms. The average
molecular mass of a chloroform molecule is therefore equal to the sum of the average atomic masses of these atoms.
Figure 3.2 outlines the calculations used to derive the molecular mass of chloroform, which is 119.37 amu.
Figure 3.2 The average mass of a chloroform molecule, CHCl3, is 119.37 amu, which is the sum of the average
atomic masses of each of its constituent atoms. The model shows the molecular structure of chloroform.
Likewise, the molecular mass of an aspirin molecule, C9H8O4, is the sum of the atomic masses of nine carbon atoms,
eight hydrogen atoms, and four oxygen atoms, which amounts to 180.15 amu (Figure 3.3).

Figure 3.3 The average mass of an aspirin molecule is 180.15 amu. The model shows the molecular structure of
aspirin, C9H8O4.
Example 3.1
Computing Molecular Mass for a Covalent Compound
Ibuprofen, C13H18O2, is a covalent compound and the active ingredient in several popular nonprescription
pain medications, such as Advil and Motrin. What is the molecular mass (amu) for this compound?
Solution
Molecules of this compound are composed of 13 carbon atoms, 18 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms.
Following the approach described above, the average molecular mass for this compound is therefore:

Acetaminophen, C8H9NO2, is a covalent compound and the active ingredient in several popular
nonprescription pain medications, such as Tylenol. What is the molecular mass (amu) for this compound?
Answer: 151.16 amu
Formula Mass for Ionic Compounds
Ionic compounds are composed of discrete cations and anions combined in ratios to yield electrically neutral bulk
matter. The formula mass for an ionic compound is calculated in the same way as the formula mass for covalent
compounds: by summing the average atomic masses of all the atoms in the compound’s formula. Keep in mind,
however, that the formula for an ionic compound does not represent the composition of a discrete molecule, so it may
not correctly be referred to as the “molecular mass.”
As an example, consider sodium chloride, NaCl, the chemical name for common table salt. Sodium chloride is an
ionic compound composed of sodium cations, Na+, and chloride anions, Cl−, combined in a 1:1 ratio. The formula
mass for this compound is computed as 58.44 amu (see Figure 3.4).
Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions 133
Figure 3.4 Table salt, NaCl, contains an array of sodium and chloride ions combined in a 1:1 ratio. Its formula mass
is 58.44 amu.
Note that the average masses of neutral sodium and chlorine atoms were used in this computation, rather than the
masses for sodium cations and chlorine anions. This approach is perfectly acceptable when computing the formula
mass of an ionic compound. Even though a sodium cation has a slightly smaller mass than a sodium atom (since it
is missing an electron), this difference will be offset by the fact that a chloride anion is slightly more massive than
a chloride atom (due to the extra electron). Moreover, the mass of an electron is negligibly small with respect to the
mass of a typical atom. Even when calculating the mass of an isolated ion, the missing or additional electrons can
generally be ignored, since their contribution to the overall mass is negligible, reflected only in the nonsignificant
digits that will be lost when the computed mass is properly rounded. The few exceptions to this guideline are very
light ions derived from elements with precisely known atomic masses.
Example 3.2
Computing Formula Mass for an Ionic Compound
Aluminum sulfate, Al2(SO4)3, is an ionic compound that is used in the manufacture of paper and in various
water purification processes. What is the formula mass (amu) of this compound?
Solution
The formula for this compound indicates it contains Al3+ and SO42− ions combined in a 2:3 ratio. For
purposes of computing a formula mass, it is helpful to rewrite the formula in the simpler format, Al2S3O12.
Following the approach outlined above, the formula mass for this compound is calculated as follows:

Answer: 310.18 amu
The Mole
The identity of a substance is defined not only by the types of atoms or ions it contains, but by the quantity of
134 Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
each type of atom or ion. For example, water, H2O, and hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, are alike in that their respective
molecules are composed of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. However, because a hydrogen peroxide molecule contains
two oxygen atoms, as opposed to the water molecule, which has only one, the two substances exhibit very different
properties. Today, sophisticated instruments allow the direct measurement of these defining microscopic traits;
however, the same traits were originally derived from the measurement of macroscopic properties (the masses
and volumes of bulk quantities of matter) using relatively simple tools (balances and volumetric glassware). This
experimental approach required the introduction of a new unit for amount of substances, the mole, which remains
indispensable in modern chemical science.
The mole is an amount unit similar to familiar units like pair, dozen, gross, etc. It provides a specific measure of the
number of atoms or molecules in a bulk sample of matter. A mole is defined as the amount of substance containing
the same number of discrete entities (such as atoms, molecules, and ions) as the number of atoms in a sample of pure
12C weighing exactly 12 g. One Latin connotation for the word “mole” is “large mass” or “bulk,” which is consistent
with its use as the name for this unit. The mole provides a link between an easily measured macroscopic property,
bulk mass, and an extremely important fundamental property, number of atoms, molecules, and so forth.
The number of entities composing a mole has been experimentally determined to be 6.02214179 × 1023, a
fundamental constant named Avogadro’s number (NA) or the Avogadro constant in honor of Italian scientist Amedeo
Avogadro. This constant is properly reported with an explicit unit of “per mole,” a conveniently rounded version
being 6.022 × 1023/mol.
Consistent with its definition as an amount unit, 1 mole of any element contains the same number of atoms as 1 mole
of any other element. The masses of 1 mole of different elements, however, are different, since the masses of the
individual atoms are drastically different. The molar mass of an element (or compound) is the mass in grams of 1
mole of that substance, a property expressed in units of grams per mole (g/mol) (see Figure 3.5).
Figure 3.5 Each sample contains 6.022 × 1023 atoms —1.00 mol of atoms. From left to right (top row): 65.4 g zinc,

g lead, and 118.7 g tin. (credit: modification of work by Mark Ott)
Because the definitions of both the mole and the atomic mass unit are based on the same reference substance, 12C, the
molar mass of any substance is numerically equivalent to its atomic or formula weight in amu. Per the amu definition,
a single 12C atom weighs 12 amu (its atomic mass is 12 amu). According to the definition of the mole, 12 g of 12C
contains 1 mole of 12C atoms (its molar mass is 12 g/mol). This relationship holds for all elements, since their atomic
Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions 135
masses are measured relative to that of the amu-reference substance, 12C. Extending this principle, the molar mass of
a compound in grams is likewise numerically equivalent to its formula mass in amu (Figure 3.6).

Na 22.99 22.99 6.022 × 1023
Cl 35.45 35.45 6.022 × 1023
While atomic mass and molar mass are numerically equivalent, keep in mind that they are vastly different in terms of
scale, as represented by the vast difference in the magnitudes of their respective units (amu versus g). To appreciate
the enormity of the mole, consider a small drop of water weighing about 0.03 g (see Figure 3.7). Although this
represents just a tiny fraction of 1 mole of water (~18 g), it contains more water molecules than can be clearly
imagined. If the molecules were distributed equally among the roughly seven billion people on earth, each person
would receive more than 100 billion molecules.

Deriving Moles from Grams for an Element
According to nutritional guidelines from the US Department of Agriculture, the estimated average
requirement for dietary potassium is 4.7 g. What is the estimated average requirement of potassium in
moles?
Solution
The mass of K is provided, and the corresponding amount of K in moles is requested. Referring to the
periodic table, the atomic mass of K is 39.10 amu, and so its molar mass is 39.10 g/mol. The given mass of
K (4.7 g) is a bit more than one-tenth the molar mass (39.10 g), so a reasonable “ballpark” estimate of the
number of moles would be slightly greater than 0.1 mol.
The molar amount of a substance may be calculated by dividing its mass (g) by its molar mass (g/mol):

Deriving Grams from Moles for an Element
A liter of air contains 9.2 × 10−4 mol argon. What is the mass of Ar in a liter of air?
Solution
The molar amount of Ar is provided and must be used to derive the corresponding mass in grams. Since
the amount of Ar is less than 1 mole, the mass will be less than the mass of 1 mole of Ar, approximately
40 g. The molar amount in question is approximately one-one thousandth (~10−3) of a mole, and so the
corresponding mass should be roughly one-one thousandth of the molar mass (~0.04 g):
In this case, logic dictates (and the factor-label method supports) multiplying the provided amount (mol) by
the molar mass (g/mol):
9.2 × 10−4 mol Ar ⎛

The result is in agreement with our expectations, around 0.04 g Ar.

The number of Cu atoms in the wire may be conveniently derived from its mass by a two-step computation:
first calculating the molar amount of Cu, and then using Avogadro’s number (NA) to convert this molar
amount to number of Cu atoms:
Considering that the provided sample mass (5.00 g) is a little less than one-tenth the mass of 1 mole of Cu
(~64 g), a reasonable estimate for the number of atoms in the sample would be on the order of one-tenth NA,
or approximately 1022 Cu atoms. Carrying out the two-step computation yields:

Derive the number of moles of a compound from its mass following the same procedure used for an element

of oxygen, and 1 mole of nitrogen:
The provided mass of glycine (~28 g) is a bit more than one-third the molar mass (~75 g/mol), so
the computed result is expected to be a bit greater than one-third of a mole (~0.33 mol). Dividing the

Counting Neurotransmitter Molecules in the Brain
The brain is the control center of the central nervous system (Figure 3.9). It sends and receives signals to
and from muscles and other internal organs to monitor and control their functions; it processes stimuli detected
by sensory organs to guide interactions with the external world; and it houses the complex physiological
processes that give rise to our intellect and emotions. The broad field of neuroscience spans all aspects of
the structure and function of the central nervous system, including research on the anatomy and physiology
of the brain. Great progress has been made in brain research over the past few decades, and the BRAIN
Initiative, a federal initiative announced in 2013, aims to accelerate and capitalize on these advances through
the concerted efforts of various industrial, academic, and government agencies (more details available at
www.whitehouse.gov/share/brain-initiative).
Figure 3.9 (a) A typical human brain weighs about 1.5 kg and occupies a volume of roughly 1.1 L. (b)
Information is transmitted in brain tissue and throughout the central nervous system by specialized cells
called neurons (micrograph shows cells at 1600× magnification).
Specialized cells called neurons transmit information between different parts of the central nervous system by
way of electrical and chemical signals. Chemical signaling occurs at the interface between different neurons
when one of the cells releases molecules (called neurotransmitters) that diffuse across the small gap between
the cells (called the synapse) and bind to the surface of the other cell. These neurotransmitter molecules are
stored in small intracellular structures called vesicles that fuse to the cell wall and then break open to release
their contents when the neuron is appropriately stimulated. This process is called exocytosis (see Figure 3.10).
One neurotransmitter that has been very extensively studied is dopamine, C8H11NO2. Dopamine is involved in
various neurological processes that impact a wide variety of human behaviors. Dysfunctions in the dopamine
systems of the brain underlie serious neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s and schizophrenia.

Figure 3.10 (a) Chemical signals are transmitted from neurons to other cells by the release of
neurotransmitter molecules into the small gaps (synapses) between the cells. (b) Dopamine, C8H11NO2, is a
neurotransmitter involved in a number of neurological processes.
One important aspect of the complex processes related to dopamine signaling is the number of
neurotransmitter molecules released during exocytosis. Since this number is a central factor in determining
neurological response (and subsequent human thought and action), it is important to know how this number
changes with certain controlled stimulations, such as the administration of drugs. It is also important to
understand the mechanism responsible for any changes in the number of neurotransmitter molecules
released—for example, some dysfunction in exocytosis, a change in the number of vesicles in the neuron, or
a change in the number of neurotransmitter molecules in each vesicle.
Significant progress has been made recently in directly measuring the number of dopamine molecules
stored in individual vesicles and the amount actually released when the vesicle undergoes exocytosis. Using
miniaturized probes that can selectively detect dopamine molecules in very small amounts, scientists have
determined that the vesicles of a certain type of mouse brain neuron contain an average of 30,000 dopamine
molecules per vesicle (about 5 × 10−20 mol or 50 zmol). Analysis of these neurons from mice subjected to
various drug therapies shows significant changes in the average number of dopamine molecules contained in
individual vesicles, increasing or decreasing by up to three-fold, depending on the specific drug used. These
studies also indicate that not all of the dopamine in a given vesicle is released during exocytosis, suggesting
that it may be possible to regulate the fraction released using pharmaceutical therapies.[1]

3.2 Determining Empirical and Molecular Formulas
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Compute the percent composition of a compound
• Determine the empirical formula of a compound
• Determine the molecular formula of a compound
The previous section discussed the relationship between the bulk mass of a substance and the number of atoms or
molecules it contains (moles). Given the chemical formula of the substance, one may determine the amount of the
substance (moles) from its mass, and vice versa. But what if the chemical formula of a substance is unknown? In
this section, these same principles will be applied to derive the chemical formulas of unknown substances from
experimental mass measurements.
Percent Composition
The elemental makeup of a compound defines its chemical identity, and chemical formulas are the most succinct way
of representing this elemental makeup. When a compound’s formula is unknown, measuring the mass of each of its
constituent elements is often the first step in the process of determining the formula experimentally. The results of
these measurements permit the calculation of the compound’s percent composition, defined as the percentage by
mass of each element in the compound. For example, consider a gaseous compound composed solely of carbon and
hydrogen. The percent composition of this compound could be represented as follows:
% H = mass H
mass compound × 100%
% C = mass C
mass compound × 100%
If analysis of a 10.0-g sample of this gas showed it to contain 2.5 g H and 7.5 g C, the percent composition would be
calculated to be 25% H and 75% C:
% H = 2.5 g H
10.0 g compound × 100% = 25%
% C = 7.5 g C
10.0 g compound × 100% = 75%
Example 3.9
Calculation of Percent Composition
Analysis of a 12.04-g sample of a liquid compound composed of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen showed it
to contain 7.34 g C, 1.85 g H, and 2.85 g N. What is the percent composition of this compound?
Solution
To calculate percent composition, divide the experimentally derived mass of each element by the overall
mass of the compound, and then convert to a percentage:
144 Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
% C = 7.34 g C
12.04 g compound × 100% = 61.0%
% H = 1.85 g H
12.04 g compound × 100% = 15.4%
% N = 2.85 g N
12.04 g compound × 100% = 23.7%
The analysis results indicate that the compound is 61.0% C, 15.4% H, and 23.7% N by mass.

A 24.81-g sample of a gaseous compound containing only carbon, oxygen, and chlorine is determined to
contain 3.01 g C, 4.00 g O, and 17.81 g Cl. What is this compound’s percent composition?
Answer: 12.1% C, 16.1% O, 71.8% Cl
Determining Percent Composition from Molecular or Empirical Formulas
Percent composition is also useful for evaluating the relative abundance of a given element in different compounds of
known formulas. As one example, consider the common nitrogen-containing fertilizers ammonia (NH3), ammonium
nitrate (NH4NO3), and urea (CH4N2O). The element nitrogen is the active ingredient for agricultural purposes, so the
mass percentage of nitrogen in the compound is a practical and economic concern for consumers choosing among
these fertilizers. For these sorts of applications, the percent composition of a compound is easily derived from its
formula mass and the atomic masses of its constituent elements. A molecule of NH3 contains one N atom weighing
14.01 amu and three H atoms weighing a total of (3 × 1.008 amu) = 3.024 amu. The formula mass of ammonia is
therefore (14.01 amu + 3.024 amu) = 17.03 amu, and its percent composition is:
% N = 14.01 amu N
17.03 amu NH3
× 100% = 82.27%
% H = 3.024 amu H
17.03 amu NH3
× 100% = 17.76%
This same approach may be taken considering a pair of molecules, a dozen molecules, or a mole of molecules, etc.
The latter amount is most convenient and would simply involve the use of molar masses instead of atomic and formula
masses, as demonstrated Example 3.10. As long as the molecular or empirical formula of the compound in question
is known, the percent composition may be derived from the atomic or molar masses of the compound's elements.
Example 3.10
Determining Percent Composition from a Molecular Formula
Aspirin is a compound with the molecular formula C9H8O4. What is its percent composition?
Solution
To calculate the percent composition, the masses of C, H, and O in a known mass of C9H8O4 are needed.
It is convenient to consider 1 mol of C9H8O4 and use its molar mass (180.159 g/mole, determined from the
chemical formula) to calculate the percentages of each of its elements:
Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions 145
% C = 9 mol C × molar mass C
molar mass C9 H8 O4
× 100 = 9 × 12.01 g/mol
180.159 g/mol × 100 = 108.09 g/mol
180.159 g/mol × 100
% C = 60.00% C
% H = 8 mol H × molar mass H
molar mass C9 H8 O4
× 100 = 8 × 1.008 g/mol
180.159 g/mol × 100 = 8.064 g/mol
180.159 g/mol × 100
% H = 4.476% H
% O = 4 mol O × molar mass O
molar mass C9 H8 O4
× 100 = 4 × 16.00 g/mol
180.159 g/mol × 100 = 64.00 g/mol
180.159 g/mol × 100
% O = 35.52%
Note that these percentages sum to equal 100.00% when appropriately rounded.

Answer: 69.9% Fe
Determination of Empirical Formulas
As previously mentioned, the most common approach to determining a compound’s chemical formula is to first
measure the masses of its constituent elements. However, keep in mind that chemical formulas represent the relative
numbers, not masses, of atoms in the substance. Therefore, any experimentally derived data involving mass must be
used to derive the corresponding numbers of atoms in the compound. This is accomplished using molar masses to
convert the mass of each element to a number of moles. These molar amounts are used to compute whole-number
ratios that can be used to derive the empirical formula of the substance. Consider a sample of compound determined
to contain 1.71 g C and 0.287 g H. The corresponding numbers of atoms (in moles) are:
1.17 g C × 1 mol C
12.01 g C = 0.142 mol C
0.287 g H × 1 mol H
1.008 g H = 0.284 mol H
Thus, this compound may be represented by the formula C0.142H0.248. Per convention, formulas contain whole-
number subscripts, which can be achieved by dividing each subscript by the smaller subscript:
C 0.142
0.142
H 0.284
0.142
or CH2
(Recall that subscripts of “1” are not written but rather assumed if no other number is present.)
The empirical formula for this compound is thus CH2. This may or not be the compound’s molecular formula as well;
however, additional information is needed to make that determination (as discussed later in this section).
Consider as another example a sample of compound determined to contain 5.31 g Cl and 8.40 g O. Following the
same approach yields a tentative empirical formula of:
C10.150 O0.525 = Cl 0.150
0.150
O 0.525
0.150
= ClO3.5
In this case, dividing by the smallest subscript still leaves us with a decimal subscript in the empirical formula. To
convert this into a whole number, multiply each of the subscripts by two, retaining the same atom ratio and yielding
Cl2O7 as the final empirical formula.
In summary, empirical formulas are derived from experimentally measured element masses by:
1. Deriving the number of moles of each element from its mass
2. Dividing each element’s molar amount by the smallest molar amount to yield subscripts for a tentative
empirical formula

⎞
⎠ = 0.6261 mol Fe
15.03 g O⎛
⎝ mol O

⎠ = 0.9394 mol O

0.6261
0.6261 = 1.000 mol Fe
0.9394
0.6261 = 1.500 mol O
The ratio is 1.000 mol of iron to 1.500 mol of oxygen (Fe1O1.5). Finally, multiply the ratio by two to get the
smallest possible whole number subscripts while still maintaining the correct iron-to-oxygen ratio:
2⎛
⎝Fe1 O1.5⎞
⎠ = Fe2 O3

Deriving Empirical Formulas from Percent Composition
Finally, with regard to deriving empirical formulas, consider instances in which a compound’s percent composition
is available rather than the absolute masses of the compound’s constituent elements. In such cases, the percent
composition can be used to calculate the masses of elements present in any convenient mass of compound; these
masses can then be used to derive the empirical formula in the usual fashion.

Solution
Since the scale for percentages is 100, it is most convenient to calculate the mass of elements present in
a sample weighing 100 g. The calculation is “most convenient” because, per the definition for percent
composition, the mass of a given element in grams is numerically equivalent to the element’s mass
percentage. This numerical equivalence results from the definition of the “percentage” unit, whose name is
derived from the Latin phrase per centum meaning “by the hundred.” Considering this definition, the mass
percentages provided may be more conveniently expressed as fractions:
27.29% C = 27.29 g C
100 g compound
72.71% O = 72.71 g O
100 g compound
The molar amounts of carbon and hydrogen in a 100-g sample are calculated by dividing each element’s
mass by its molar mass:
27.29 g C⎛
⎝ mol C
12.01 g
⎞
⎠ = 2.272 mol C
72.71 g O⎛
⎝ mol O
16.00 g
⎞
⎠ = 4.544 mol O
Coefficients for the tentative empirical formula are derived by dividing each molar amount by the lesser of
the two:
2.272 mol C
2.272 = 1
4.544 mol O

What is the empirical formula of a compound containing 40.0% C, 6.71% H, and 53.28% O?
Answer: CH2O
Derivation of Molecular Formulas
Recall that empirical formulas are symbols representing the relative numbers of a compound’s elements. Determining
the absolute numbers of atoms that compose a single molecule of a covalent compound requires knowledge of both
its empirical formula and its molecular mass or molar mass. These quantities may be determined experimentally
by various measurement techniques. Molecular mass, for example, is often derived from the mass spectrum of the
compound (see discussion of this technique in the previous chapter on atoms and molecules). Molar mass can be
measured by a number of experimental methods, many of which will be introduced in later chapters of this text.
Molecular formulas are derived by comparing the compound’s molecular or molar mass to its empirical formula
mass. As the name suggests, an empirical formula mass is the sum of the average atomic masses of all the atoms
represented in an empirical formula. If the molecular (or molar) mass of the substance is known, it may be divided by
the empirical formula mass to yield the number of empirical formula units per molecule (n):
molecular or molar mass ⎛
⎝amu or g
mol
⎞
⎠
empirical formula mass ⎛
⎝amu or g
mol
⎞
⎠
= n formula units/molecule
The molecular formula is then obtained by multiplying each subscript in the empirical formula by n, as shown by the
generic empirical formula AxBy:
(Ax By)n = Anx Bny
For example, consider a covalent compound whose empirical formula is determined to be CH2O. The empirical
formula mass for this compound is approximately 30 amu (the sum of 12 amu for one C atom, 2 amu for two H
atoms, and 16 amu for one O atom). If the compound’s molecular mass is determined to be 180 amu, this indicates
that molecules of this compound contain six times the number of atoms represented in the empirical formula:
180 amu/molecule
30 amu
formula unit
= 6 formula units/molecule
Molecules of this compound are then represented by molecular formulas whose subscripts are six times greater than
those in the empirical formula:
(CH2 O)6 = C6 H12 O6
Note that this same approach may be used when the molar mass (g/mol) instead of the molecular mass (amu) is
used. In this case, one mole of empirical formula units and molecules is considered, as opposed to single units and
molecules.

Determination of the Molecular Formula for Nicotine
Nicotine, an alkaloid in the nightshade family of plants that is mainly responsible for the addictive nature
of cigarettes, contains 74.02% C, 8.710% H, and 17.27% N. If 40.57 g of nicotine contains 0.2500 mol
nicotine, what is the molecular formula?
Solution
Determining the molecular formula from the provided data will require comparison of the compound’s
empirical formula mass to its molar mass. As the first step, use the percent composition to derive the
150 Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions

compound’s empirical formula. Assuming a convenient, a 100-g sample of nicotine yields the following
molar amounts of its elements:
⎛
⎝74.02 g C⎞
⎠
⎛
⎝ 1 mol C
12.01 g C
⎞
⎠ = 6.163 mol C
⎛
⎝8.710 g H⎞
⎠
⎛
⎝1 mol H
1.01 g H
⎞
⎠ = 8.624 mol H
⎛
⎝17.27 g N⎞
⎠
⎛
⎝ 1 mol N
14.01 g N
⎞
⎠ = 1.233 mol N
Next, calculate the molar ratios of these elements relative to the least abundant element, N.
6.163 mol C / 1.233 mol N = 5
8.264 mol H / 1.233 mol N = 7
1.233 mol N / 1.233 mol N = 1
1.233
1.233 = 1.000 mol N
6.163
1.233 = 4.998 mol C
8.624
1.233 = 6.994 mol H
The C-to-N and H-to-N molar ratios are adequately close to whole numbers, and so the empirical formula
is C5H7N. The empirical formula mass for this compound is therefore 81.13 amu/formula unit, or 81.13 g/
mol formula unit.
Calculate the molar mass for nicotine from the given mass and molar amount of compound:
40.57 g nicotine
0.2500 mol nicotine = 162.3 g

Comparing the molar mass and empirical formula mass indicates that each nicotine molecule contains two
formula units:
162.3 g/mol
81.13 g
formula unit
= 2 formula units/molecule
Finally, derive the molecular formula for nicotine from the empirical formula by multiplying each subscript
by two:

Preceding sections of this chapter focused on the composition of substances: samples of matter that contain only one

type of element or compound. However, mixtures—samples of matter containing two or more substances physically
combined—are more commonly encountered in nature than are pure substances. Similar to a pure substance, the
relative composition of a mixture plays an important role in determining its properties. The relative amount of oxygen
in a planet’s atmosphere determines its ability to sustain aerobic life. The relative amounts of iron, carbon, nickel, and
other elements in steel (a mixture known as an “alloy”) determine its physical strength and resistance to corrosion.
The relative amount of the active ingredient in a medicine determines its effectiveness in achieving the desired
pharmacological effect. The relative amount of sugar in a beverage determines its sweetness (see Figure 3.14). This
section will describe one of the most common ways in which the relative compositions of mixtures may be quantified.
Figure 3.14 Sugar is one of many components in the complex mixture known as coffee. The amount of sugar in a
given amount of coffee is an important determinant of the beverage’s sweetness. (credit: Jane Whitney)
Solutions
Solutions have previously been defined as homogeneous mixtures, meaning that the composition of the mixture
(and therefore its properties) is uniform throughout its entire volume. Solutions occur frequently in nature and have
also been implemented in many forms of manmade technology. A more thorough treatment of solution properties is
provided in the chapter on solutions and colloids, but provided here is an introduction to some of the basic properties
of solutions.
The relative amount of a given solution component is known as its concentration. Often, though not always, a
solution contains one component with a concentration that is significantly greater than that of all other components.
This component is called the solvent and may be viewed as the medium in which the other components are dispersed,
or dissolved. Solutions in which water is the solvent are, of course, very common on our planet. A solution in which
water is the solvent is called an aqueous solution.
A solute is a component of a solution that is typically present at a much lower concentration than the solvent.
Solute concentrations are often described with qualitative terms such as dilute (of relatively low concentration) and
concentrated (of relatively high concentration).
Concentrations may be quantitatively assessed using a wide variety of measurement units, each convenient for
particular applications. Molarity (M) is a useful concentration unit for many applications in chemistry. Molarity is
defined as the number of moles of solute in exactly 1 liter (1 L) of the solution:

Solution
Since the molar amount of solute and the volume of solution are both given, the molarity can be calculated
using the definition of molarity. Per this definition, the solution volume must be converted from mL to L:
M = mol solute

Distilled white vinegar (Figure 3.15) is a solution of acetic acid, CH3CO2H, in water. A 0.500-L vinegar

molarity?
Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions 153
Figure 3.15 Distilled white vinegar is a solution of acetic acid in water.

As in previous examples, the definition of molarity is the primary equation used to calculate the quantity

Determining the Mass of Solute in a Given Volume of Solution
How many grams of NaCl are contained in 0.250 L of a 5.30-M solution?

M = mol solute

mol solute = M × L solution
mol solute = 5.30 mol NaCl
L × 0.250 L = 1.325 mol NaCl
Finally, this molar amount is used to derive the mass of NaCl:

When performing calculations stepwise, as in Example 3.17, it is important to refrain from rounding any
intermediate calculation results, which can lead to rounding errors in the final result. In Example 3.17, the molar
amount of NaCl computed in the first step, 1.325 mol, would be properly rounded to 1.32 mol if it were to be
reported; however, although the last digit (5) is not significant, it must be retained as a guard digit in the intermediate
calculation. If the guard digit had not been retained, the final calculation for the mass of NaCl would have been 77.1
g, a difference of 0.3 g.
In addition to retaining a guard digit for intermediate calculations, rounding errors may also be avoided by performing
computations in a single step (see Example 3.18). This eliminates intermediate steps so that only the final result is
rounded.

Determining the Volume of Solution Containing a Given Mass of Solute
In Example 3.16, the concentration of acetic acid in white vinegar was determined to be 0.839 M. What

First, use the molar mass to calculate moles of acetic acid from the given mass:
g solute × mol solute
g solute = mol solute
Then, use the molarity of the solution to calculate the volume of solution containing this molar amount of
solute:
mol solute × L solution
mol solute = L solution
Combining these two steps into one yields:

Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions 155
Dilution of Solutions
Dilution is the process whereby the concentration of a solution is lessened by the addition of solvent. For example, a
glass of iced tea becomes increasingly diluted as the ice melts. The water from the melting ice increases the volume
of the solvent (water) and the overall volume of the solution (iced tea), thereby reducing the relative concentrations
of the solutes that give the beverage its taste (Figure 3.16).
Figure 3.16 Both solutions contain the same mass of copper nitrate. The solution on the right is more dilute because
the copper nitrate is dissolved in more solvent. (credit: Mark Ott)
Dilution is also a common means of preparing solutions of a desired concentration. By adding solvent to a measured
portion of a more concentrated stock solution, a solution of lesser concentration may be prepared. For example,
commercial pesticides are typically sold as solutions in which the active ingredients are far more concentrated than is
appropriate for their application. Before they can be used on crops, the pesticides must be diluted. This is also a very
common practice for the preparation of a number of common laboratory reagents.
A simple mathematical relationship can be used to relate the volumes and concentrations of a solution before and
after the dilution process. According to the definition of molarity, the molar amount of solute in a solution (n) is equal
to the product of the solution’s molarity (M) and its volume in liters (L):
n = ML
Expressions like these may be written for a solution before and after it is diluted:
n1 = M1 L1
n2 = M2 L2
where the subscripts “1” and “2” refer to the solution before and after the dilution, respectively. Since the dilution
process does not change the amount of solute in the solution, n1 = n2. Thus, these two equations may be set equal to
one another:
M1 L1 = M2 L2
This relation is commonly referred to as the dilution equation. Although this equation uses molarity as the unit of
concentration and liters as the unit of volume, other units of concentration and volume may be used as long as the
units properly cancel per the factor-label method. Reflecting this versatility, the dilution equation is often written in
the more general form:
C1 V1 = C2 V2
where C and V are concentration and volume, respectively.

solute amount, solution volume, and concentration and to confirm the dilution equation.
Example 3.19
Determining the Concentration of a Diluted Solution
If 0.850 L of a 5.00-M solution of copper nitrate, Cu(NO3)2, is diluted to a volume of 1.80 L by the addition
of water, what is the molarity of the diluted solution?
Solution
The stock concentration, C1, and volume, V1, are provided as well as the volume of the diluted solution, V2.
Rearrange the dilution equation to isolate the unknown property, the concentration of the diluted solution,
C2:
C1 V1 = C2 V2
C2 = C1 V1
V2
Since the stock solution is being diluted by more than two-fold (volume is increased from 0.85 L to 1.80
L), the diluted solution’s concentration is expected to be less than one-half 5 M. This ballpark estimate will
be compared to the calculated result to check for any gross errors in computation (for example, such as an
improper substitution of the given quantities). Substituting the given values for the terms on the right side
of this equation yields:
C2 = 0.850 L × 5.00 mol
L
1.80 L = 2.36 M
This result compares well to our ballpark estimate (it’s a bit less than one-half the stock concentration, 5 M).

Since the diluted concentration (0.12 M) is slightly more than one-fourth the original concentration (0.45

44 mL. Substituting the given values and solving for the unknown volume yields:
V2 = (0.45 M)(0.011 L)
(0.12 M)
V2 = 0.041 L

solution, V2 and C2. Find the volume of the stock solution, V1 by rearranging the dilution equation to isolate
V1:
C1 V1 = C2 V2
V1 = C2 V2
C1
Since the concentration of the diluted solution 0.100 M is roughly one-sixteenth that of the stock solution
(1.59 M), the volume of the stock solution is expected to be about one-sixteenth that of the diluted solution,
or around 0.3 liters. Substituting the given values and solving for the unknown volume yields:
V1 = (0.100 M)(5.00 L)
1.59 M
V1 = 0.314 L
Thus, 0.314 L of the 1.59-M solution is needed to prepare the desired solution. This result is consistent with

• Define the concentration units of mass percentage, volume percentage, mass-volume percentage, parts-per-

• Perform computations relating a solution’s concentration and its components’ volumes and/or masses using

The previous section introduced molarity, a very useful measurement unit for evaluating the concentration of
solutions. However, molarity is only one measure of concentration. This section will describe some other units of
concentration that are commonly used in various applications, either for convenience or by convention.
Mass Percentage
Earlier in this chapter, percent composition was introduced as a measure of the relative amount of a given element in
a compound. Percentages are also commonly used to express the composition of mixtures, including solutions. The
mass percentage of a solution component is defined as the ratio of the component’s mass to the solution’s mass,
expressed as a percentage:
mass percentage = mass of component
mass of solution × 100%
Mass percentage is also referred to by similar names such as percent mass, percent weight, weight/weight percent,
and other variations on this theme. The most common symbol for mass percentage is simply the percent sign, %,
although more detailed symbols are often used including %mass, %weight, and (w/w)%. Use of these more detailed
symbols can prevent confusion of mass percentages with other types of percentages, such as volume percentages (to
be discussed later in this section).
Mass percentages are popular concentration units for consumer products. The label of a typical liquid bleach bottle
(Figure 3.17) cites the concentration of its active ingredient, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), as being 7.4%. A
100.0-g sample of bleach would therefore contain 7.4 g of NaOCl.
Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions 159

7.4% NaOCl by mass.
Example 3.22
Calculation of Percent by Mass
A 5.0-g sample of spinal fluid contains 3.75 mg (0.00375 g) of glucose. What is the percent by mass of
glucose in spinal fluid?
Solution
The spinal fluid sample contains roughly 4 mg of glucose in 5000 mg of fluid, so the mass fraction of
glucose should be a bit less than one part in 1000, or about 0.1%. Substituting the given masses into the
equation defining mass percentage yields:
% glucose = 3.75 mg glucose × 1 g
1000 mg
5.0 g spinal fluid = 0.075%
The computed mass percentage agrees with our rough estimate (it’s a bit less than 0.1%).
Note that while any mass unit may be used to compute a mass percentage (mg, g, kg, oz, and so on),
the same unit must be used for both the solute and the solution so that the mass units cancel, yielding a
dimensionless ratio. In this case, the solute mass unit in the numerator was converted from mg to g to match
the units in the denominator. Alternatively, the spinal fluid mass unit in the denominator could have been
converted from g to mg instead. As long as identical mass units are used for both solute and solution, the
computed mass percentage will be correct.

“Concentrated” hydrochloric acid is an aqueous solution of 37.2% HCl that is commonly used as a
laboratory reagent. The density of this solution is 1.19 g/mL. What mass of HCl is contained in 0.500 L of
this solution?
Solution
The HCl concentration is near 40%, so a 100-g portion of this solution would contain about 40 g of HCl.
Since the solution density isn’t greatly different from that of water (1 g/mL), a reasonable estimate of the
HCl mass in 500 g (0.5 L) of the solution is about five times greater than that in a 100 g portion, or 5 ×
40 = 200 g. In order to derive the mass of solute in a solution from its mass percentage, the mass of the
solution must be known. Using the solution density given, convert the solution’s volume to mass, and then
use the given mass percentage to calculate the solute mass. This mathematical approach is outlined in this
flowchart:
For proper unit cancellation, the 0.500-L volume is converted into 500 mL, and the mass percentage is
expressed as a ratio, 37.2 g HCl/g solution:
500 mL solution ⎛
⎝1.19 g solution

Liquid volumes over a wide range of magnitudes are conveniently measured using common and relatively
inexpensive laboratory equipment. The concentration of a solution formed by dissolving a liquid solute in a liquid
solvent is therefore often expressed as a volume percentage, %vol or (v/v)%:
volume percentage = volume solute

Mass-Volume Percentage
“Mixed” percentage units, derived from the mass of solute and the volume of solution, are popular for certain
biochemical and medical applications. A mass-volume percent is a ratio of a solute’s mass to the solution’s volume
expressed as a percentage. The specific units used for solute mass and solution volume may vary, depending on the
solution. For example, physiological saline solution, used to prepare intravenous fluids, has a concentration of 0.9%
mass/volume (m/v), indicating that the composition is 0.9 g of solute per 100 mL of solution. The concentration
of glucose in blood (commonly referred to as “blood sugar”) is also typically expressed in terms of a mass-volume
ratio. Though not expressed explicitly as a percentage, its concentration is usually given in milligrams of glucose per
deciliter (100 mL) of blood (Figure 3.18).
Figure 3.18 “Mixed” mass-volume units are commonly encountered in medical settings. (a) The NaCl concentration
of physiological saline is 0.9% (m/v). (b) This device measures glucose levels in a sample of blood. The normal range
for glucose concentration in blood (fasting) is around 70–100 mg/dL. (credit a: modification of work by “The National
Guard”/Flickr; credit b: modification of work by Biswarup Ganguly)
Parts per Million and Parts per Billion
Very low solute concentrations are often expressed using appropriately small units such as parts per million (ppm)
or parts per billion (ppb). Like percentage (“part per hundred”) units, ppm and ppb may be defined in terms of
masses, volumes, or mixed mass-volume units. There are also ppm and ppb units defined with respect to numbers of
atoms and molecules.
The mass-based definitions of ppm and ppb are given here:
162 Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
ppm = mass solute
mass solution × 106 ppm
ppb = mass solute
mass solution × 109 ppb
Both ppm and ppb are convenient units for reporting the concentrations of pollutants and other trace contaminants
in water. Concentrations of these contaminants are typically very low in treated and natural waters, and their levels
cannot exceed relatively low concentration thresholds without causing adverse effects on health and wildlife. For
example, the EPA has identified the maximum safe level of fluoride ion in tap water to be 4 ppm. Inline water filters
are designed to reduce the concentration of fluoride and several other trace-level contaminants in tap water (Figure

The definitions of the ppm and ppb units may be used to convert the given concentration from ppb to ppm.
Comparing these two unit definitions shows that ppm is 1000 times greater than ppb (1 ppm = 103 ppb).
Thus:
15 ppb × 1 ppm
103 ppb = 0.015 ppm
The definition of the ppb unit may be used to calculate the requested mass if the mass of the solution
is provided. Since the volume of solution (300 mL) is given, its density must be used to derive the
Chapter 3 | Composition of Substances and Solutions 163
corresponding mass. Assume the density of tap water to be roughly the same as that of pure water (~1.00
g/mL), since the concentrations of any dissolved substances should not be very large. Rearranging the
equation defining the ppb unit and substituting the given quantities yields:
ppb = mass solute
mass solution × 109 ppb
mass solute = ppb × mass solution
109 ppb
mass solute = 15 ppb × 300 mL × 1.00 g
mL
109 ppb = 4.5 × 10−6 g
Finally, convert this mass to the requested unit of micrograms:
4.5 × 10−6 g × 1 μg
10−6 g = 4.5 μg

Summary
3.1 Formula Mass and the Mole Concept
The formula mass of a substance is the sum of the average atomic masses of each atom represented in the chemical
formula and is expressed in atomic mass units. The formula mass of a covalent compound is also called the molecular
mass. A convenient amount unit for expressing very large numbers of atoms or molecules is the mole. Experimental
measurements have determined the number of entities composing 1 mole of substance to be 6.022 × 1023, a quantity
called Avogadro’s number. The mass in grams of 1 mole of substance is its molar mass. Due to the use of the same
reference substance in defining the atomic mass unit and the mole, the formula mass (amu) and molar mass (g/mol)
for any substance are numerically equivalent (for example, one H2O molecule weighs approximately18 amu and 1
mole of H2O molecules weighs approximately 18 g).
3.2 Determining Empirical and Molecular Formulas
The chemical identity of a substance is defined by the types and relative numbers of atoms composing its fundamental
entities (molecules in the case of covalent compounds, ions in the case of ionic compounds). A compound’s percent
composition provides the mass percentage of each element in the compound, and it is often experimentally determined
and used to derive the compound’s empirical formula. The empirical formula mass of a covalent compound may be
compared to the compound’s molecular or molar mass to derive a molecular formula.
3.3 Molarity
Solutions are homogeneous mixtures. Many solutions contain one component, called the solvent, in which other
components, called solutes, are dissolved. An aqueous solution is one for which the solvent is water. The
concentration of a solution is a measure of the relative amount of solute in a given amount of solution. Concentrations
may be measured using various units, with one very useful unit being molarity, defined as the number of moles of
solute per liter of solution. The solute concentration of a solution may be decreased by adding solvent, a process
referred to as dilution. The dilution equation is a simple relation between concentrations and volumes of a solution
before and after dilution.
3.4 Other Units for Solution Concentrations
In addition to molarity, a number of other solution concentration units are used in various applications. Percentage
concentrations based on the solution components’ masses, volumes, or both are useful for expressing relatively high
concentrations, whereas lower concentrations are conveniently expressed using ppm or ppb units. These units are
popular in environmental, medical, and other fields where mole-based units such as molarity are not as commonly
used.

Introduction
Solid-fuel rockets are a central feature in the world’s space exploration programs, including the new Space Launch
System being developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to replace the retired Space
Shuttle fleet (Figure 4.1). The engines of these rockets rely on carefully prepared solid mixtures of chemicals
combined in precisely measured amounts. Igniting the mixture initiates a vigorous chemical reaction that rapidly
generates large amounts of gaseous products. These gases are ejected from the rocket engine through its nozzle,
providing the thrust needed to propel heavy payloads into space. Both the nature of this chemical reaction and the
relationships between the amounts of the substances being consumed and produced by the reaction are critically
important considerations that determine the success of the technology. This chapter will describe how to symbolize
chemical reactions using chemical equations, how to classify some common chemical reactions by identifying
patterns of reactivity, and how to determine the quantitative relations between the amounts of substances involved in
chemical reactions—that is, the reaction stoichiometry.

4.1 Writing and Balancing Chemical Equations
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Derive chemical equations from narrative descriptions of chemical reactions.
• Write and balance chemical equations in molecular, total ionic, and net ionic formats.
An earlier chapter of this text introduced the use of element symbols to represent individual atoms. When atoms
gain or lose electrons to yield ions, or combine with other atoms to form molecules, their symbols are modified
or combined to generate chemical formulas that appropriately represent these species. Extending this symbolism to
represent both the identities and the relative quantities of substances undergoing a chemical (or physical) change
involves writing and balancing a chemical equation. Consider as an example the reaction between one methane
molecule (CH4) and two diatomic oxygen molecules (O2) to produce one carbon dioxide molecule (CO2) and two
water molecules (H2O). The chemical equation representing this process is provided in the upper half of Figure 4.2,
with space-filling molecular models shown in the lower half of the figure.
Figure 4.2 The reaction between methane and oxygen to yield carbon dioxide and water (shown at bottom) may be
represented by a chemical equation using formulas (top).
This example illustrates the fundamental aspects of any chemical equation:
1. The substances undergoing reaction are called reactants, and their formulas are placed on the left side of the
equation.
2. The substances generated by the reaction are called products, and their formulas are placed on the right side
of the equation.
3. Plus signs (+) separate individual reactant and product formulas, and an arrow (⟶) separates the reactant
and product (left and right) sides of the equation.
4. The relative numbers of reactant and product species are represented by coefficients (numbers placed
immediately to the left of each formula). A coefficient of 1 is typically omitted.
It is common practice to use the smallest possible whole-number coefficients in a chemical equation, as is done in
this example. Realize, however, that these coefficients represent the relative numbers of reactants and products, and,
therefore, they may be correctly interpreted as ratios. Methane and oxygen react to yield carbon dioxide and water
in a 1:2:1:2 ratio. This ratio is satisfied if the numbers of these molecules are, respectively, 1-2-1-2, or 2-4-2-4, or
3-6-3-6, and so on (Figure 4.3). Likewise, these coefficients may be interpreted with regard to any amount (number)
unit, and so this equation may be correctly read in many ways, including:
• One methane molecule and two oxygen molecules react to yield one carbon dioxide molecule and two water

molecules.
• One dozen methane molecules and two dozen oxygen molecules react to yield one dozen carbon dioxide
molecules and two dozen water molecules.
• One mole of methane molecules and 2 moles of oxygen molecules react to yield 1 mole of carbon dioxide
molecules and 2 moles of water molecules.
Figure 4.3 Regardless of the absolute numbers of molecules involved, the ratios between numbers of molecules of
each species that react (the reactants) and molecules of each species that form (the products) are the same and are
given by the chemical reaction equation.
Balancing Equations
The chemical equation described in section 4.1 is balanced, meaning that equal numbers of atoms for each element
involved in the reaction are represented on the reactant and product sides. This is a requirement the equation must
satisfy to be consistent with the law of conservation of matter. It may be confirmed by simply summing the numbers
of atoms on either side of the arrow and comparing these sums to ensure they are equal. Note that the number of
atoms for a given element is calculated by multiplying the coefficient of any formula containing that element by the
element’s subscript in the formula. If an element appears in more than one formula on a given side of the equation, the
number of atoms represented in each must be computed and then added together. For example, both product species in
the example reaction, CO2 and H2O, contain the element oxygen, and so the number of oxygen atoms on the product
side of the equation is
⎛
⎝1 CO2 molecule × 2 O atoms
CO2 molecule
⎞
⎠ + ⎛
⎝2 H2 O molecules × 1 O atom
H2 O molecule
⎞
⎠ = 4 O atoms
The equation for the reaction between methane and oxygen to yield carbon dioxide and water is confirmed to be
balanced per this approach, as shown here:
CH4 + 2O2 ⟶ CO2 + 2H2 O
Element Reactants Products Balanced?
C 1 × 1 = 1 1 × 1 = 1 1 = 1, yes
H 4 × 1 = 4 2 × 2 = 4 4 = 4, yes
O 2 × 2 = 4 (1 × 2) + (2 × 1) = 4 4 = 4, yes
A balanced chemical equation often may be derived from a qualitative description of some chemical reaction by a
Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 177
fairly simple approach known as balancing by inspection. Consider as an example the decomposition of water to yield
molecular hydrogen and oxygen. This process is represented qualitatively by an unbalanced chemical equation:
H2 O ⟶ H2 + O2 (unbalanced)
Comparing the number of H and O atoms on either side of this equation confirms its imbalance:
Element Reactants Products Balanced?
H 1 × 2 = 2 1 × 2 = 2 2 = 2, yes
O 1 × 1 = 1 1 × 2 = 2 1 ≠ 2, no
The numbers of H atoms on the reactant and product sides of the equation are equal, but the numbers of O atoms
are not. To achieve balance, the coefficients of the equation may be changed as needed. Keep in mind, of course, that
the formula subscripts define, in part, the identity of the substance, and so these cannot be changed without altering
the qualitative meaning of the equation. For example, changing the reactant formula from H2O to H2O2 would yield
balance in the number of atoms, but doing so also changes the reactant’s identity (it’s now hydrogen peroxide and not
water). The O atom balance may be achieved by changing the coefficient for H2O to 2.
2H2 O ⟶ H2 + O2 (unbalanced)
Element Reactants Products Balanced?
H 2 × 2 = 4 1 × 2 = 2 4 ≠ 2, no
O 2 × 1 = 2 1 × 2 = 2 2 = 2, yes
The H atom balance was upset by this change, but it is easily reestablished by changing the coefficient for the H2
product to 2.
2H2 O ⟶ 2H2 + O2 (balanced)
Element Reactants Products Balanced?
H 2 × 2 = 4 2 × 2 = 4 4 = 4, yes
O 2 × 1 = 2 1 × 2 = 2 2 = 2, yes
These coefficients yield equal numbers of both H and O atoms on the reactant and product sides, and the balanced
equation is, therefore:
2H2 O ⟶ 2H2 + O2
Example 4.1

N2 + O2 ⟶ N2 O5 (unbalanced)
Next, count the number of each type of atom present in the unbalanced equation.
Element Reactants Products Balanced?
N 1 × 2 = 2 1 × 2 = 2 2 = 2, yes
O 1 × 2 = 2 1 × 5 = 5 2 ≠ 5, no
Though nitrogen is balanced, changes in coefficients are needed to balance the number of oxygen atoms. To
balance the number of oxygen atoms, a reasonable first attempt would be to change the coefficients for the
O2 and N2O5 to integers that will yield 10 O atoms (the least common multiple for the O atom subscripts in
these two formulas).
N2 + 5O2 ⟶ 2N2 O5 (unbalanced)
Element Reactants Products Balanced?
N 1 × 2 = 2 2 × 2 = 4 2 ≠ 4, no
O 5 × 2 = 10 2 × 5 = 10 10 = 10, yes
The N atom balance has been upset by this change; it is restored by changing the coefficient for the reactant
N2 to 2.
2N2 + 5O2 ⟶ 2N2 O5
Element Reactants Products Balanced?
N 2 × 2 = 4 2 × 2 = 4 4 = 4, yes
O 5 × 2 = 10 2 × 5 = 10 10 = 10, yes
The numbers of N and O atoms on either side of the equation are now equal, and so the equation is balanced.

Write a balanced equation for the decomposition of ammonium nitrate to form molecular nitrogen,
molecular oxygen, and water. (Hint: Balance oxygen last, since it is present in more than one molecule on
the right side of the equation.)
Answer: 2NH4 NO3 ⟶ 2N2 + O2 + 4H2 O
It is sometimes convenient to use fractions instead of integers as intermediate coefficients in the process of balancing
a chemical equation. When balance is achieved, all the equation’s coefficients may then be multiplied by a whole
number to convert the fractional coefficients to integers without upsetting the atom balance. For example, consider
the reaction of ethane (C2H6) with oxygen to yield H2O and CO2, represented by the unbalanced equation:
C2 H6 + O2 ⟶ H2 O + CO2 (unbalanced)
Following the usual inspection approach, one might first balance C and H atoms by changing the coefficients for the
two product species, as shown:
Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 179
C2 H6 + O2 ⟶ 3H2 O + 2CO2 (unbalanced)
This results in seven O atoms on the product side of the equation, an odd number—no integer coefficient can be used
with the O2 reactant to yield an odd number, so a fractional coefficient, 7
2, is used instead to yield a provisional
balanced equation:
C2 H6 + 7
2 O2 ⟶ 3H2 O + 2CO2
A conventional balanced equation with integer-only coefficients is derived by multiplying each coefficient by 2:
2C2 H6 + 7O2 ⟶ 6H2 O + 4CO2
Finally with regard to balanced equations, recall that convention dictates use of the smallest whole-number
coefficients. Although the equation for the reaction between molecular nitrogen and molecular hydrogen to produce
ammonia is, indeed, balanced,
3N2 + 9H2 ⟶ 6NH3
the coefficients are not the smallest possible integers representing the relative numbers of reactant and product
molecules. Dividing each coefficient by the greatest common factor, 3, gives the preferred equation:
N2 + 3H2 ⟶ 2NH3

Additional Information in Chemical Equations
The physical states of reactants and products in chemical equations very often are indicated with a parenthetical
abbreviation following the formulas. Common abbreviations include s for solids, l for liquids, g for gases, and aq
for substances dissolved in water (aqueous solutions, as introduced in the preceding chapter). These notations are
illustrated in the example equation here:
2Na(s) + 2H2 O(l) ⟶ 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g)
This equation represents the reaction that takes place when sodium metal is placed in water. The solid sodium reacts
with liquid water to produce molecular hydrogen gas and the ionic compound sodium hydroxide (a solid in pure form,
but readily dissolved in water).
Special conditions necessary for a reaction are sometimes designated by writing a word or symbol above or below the
equation’s arrow. For example, a reaction carried out by heating may be indicated by the uppercase Greek letter delta
(Δ) over the arrow.
CaCO3(s) ⟶
Δ CaO(s) + CO2(g)
Other examples of these special conditions will be encountered in more depth in later chapters.
Equations for Ionic Reactions
Given the abundance of water on earth, it stands to reason that a great many chemical reactions take place in aqueous
media. When ions are involved in these reactions, the chemical equations may be written with various levels of detail
appropriate to their intended use. To illustrate this, consider a reaction between ionic compounds taking place in an
aqueous solution. When aqueous solutions of CaCl2 and AgNO3 are mixed, a reaction takes place producing aqueous

Ca(NO3)2 and solid AgCl:
CaCl2(aq) + 2AgNO3(aq) ⟶ Ca(NO3)2(aq) + 2AgCl(s)
This balanced equation, derived in the usual fashion, is called a molecular equation because it doesn’t explicitly
represent the ionic species that are present in solution. When ionic compounds dissolve in water, they may dissociate
into their constituent ions, which are subsequently dispersed homogenously throughout the resulting solution (a
thorough discussion of this important process is provided in the chapter on solutions). Ionic compounds dissolved in
water are, therefore, more realistically represented as dissociated ions, in this case:
CaCl2(aq) ⟶ Ca2+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq)
2AgNO3(aq) ⟶ 2Ag+(aq) + 2NO3 −(aq)
Ca(NO3)2(aq) ⟶ Ca2+(aq) + 2NO3 −(aq)
Unlike these three ionic compounds, AgCl does not dissolve in water to a significant extent, as signified by its
physical state notation, s.
Explicitly representing all dissolved ions results in a complete ionic equation. In this particular case, the formulas
for the dissolved ionic compounds are replaced by formulas for their dissociated ions:
Ca2+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq) + 2Ag+(aq) + 2NO3 −(aq) ⟶ Ca2+(aq) + 2NO3 −(aq) + 2AgCl(s)
Examining this equation shows that two chemical species are present in identical form on both sides of the arrow,
Ca2+(aq) and NO3 −(aq). These spectator ions—ions whose presence is required to maintain charge neutrality—are
neither chemically nor physically changed by the process, and so they may be eliminated from the equation to yield a
more succinct representation called a net ionic equation:
Ca2+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq) + 2Ag+(aq) + 2NO3 −(aq) ⟶ Ca2+(aq) + 2NO3 −(aq) + 2AgCl(s)
2Cl−(aq) + 2Ag+(aq) ⟶ 2AgCl(s)
Following the convention of using the smallest possible integers as coefficients, this equation is then written:
Cl−(aq) + Ag+(aq) ⟶ AgCl(s)
This net ionic equation indicates that solid silver chloride may be produced from dissolved chloride and silver(I) ions,
regardless of the source of these ions. These molecular and complete ionic equations provide additional information,
namely, the ionic compounds used as sources of Cl− and Ag+.

equation for this reaction:
CO2(aq) + 2NaOH(aq) ⟶ Na2 CO3(aq) + H2 O(l)
The two dissolved ionic compounds, NaOH and Na2CO3, can be represented as dissociated ions to yield the

Finally, identify the spectator ion(s), in this case Na+(aq), and remove it from each side of the equation to

4.2 Classifying Chemical Reactions
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define three common types of chemical reactions (precipitation, acid-base, and oxidation-reduction)
• Classify chemical reactions as one of these three types given appropriate descriptions or chemical equations
• Identify common acids and bases
• Predict the solubility of common inorganic compounds by using solubility rules
• Compute the oxidation states for elements in compounds
Humans interact with one another in various and complex ways, and we classify these interactions according to
common patterns of behavior. When two humans exchange information, we say they are communicating. When they
exchange blows with their fists or feet, we say they are fighting. Faced with a wide range of varied interactions
between chemical substances, scientists have likewise found it convenient (or even necessary) to classify chemical
interactions by identifying common patterns of reactivity. This module will provide an introduction to three of the
most prevalent types of chemical reactions: precipitation, acid-base, and oxidation-reduction.
Precipitation Reactions and Solubility Rules
A precipitation reaction is one in which dissolved substances react to form one (or more) solid products. Many
reactions of this type involve the exchange of ions between ionic compounds in aqueous solution and are sometimes
referred to as double displacement, double replacement, or metathesis reactions. These reactions are common in
nature and are responsible for the formation of coral reefs in ocean waters and kidney stones in animals. They are
used widely in industry for production of a number of commodity and specialty chemicals. Precipitation reactions
also play a central role in many chemical analysis techniques, including spot tests used to identify metal ions and
gravimetric methods for determining the composition of matter (see the last module of this chapter).
The extent to which a substance may be dissolved in water, or any solvent, is quantitatively expressed as its solubility,
182 Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
defined as the maximum concentration of a substance that can be achieved under specified conditions. Substances
with relatively large solubilities are said to be soluble. A substance will precipitate when solution conditions are
such that its concentration exceeds its solubility. Substances with relatively low solubilities are said to be insoluble,
and these are the substances that readily precipitate from solution. More information on these important concepts is
provided in a later chapter on solutions. For purposes of predicting the identities of solids formed by precipitation
reactions, one may simply refer to patterns of solubility that have been observed for many ionic compounds (Table
4.1).

A vivid example of precipitation is observed when solutions of potassium iodide and lead nitrate are mixed, resulting
in the formation of solid lead iodide:
2KI(aq) + Pb(NO3)2(aq) ⟶ PbI2(s) + 2KNO3(aq)
This observation is consistent with the solubility guidelines: The only insoluble compound among all those involved
is lead iodide, one of the exceptions to the general solubility of iodide salts.
Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 183
The net ionic equation representing this reaction is:
Pb2+(aq) + 2I−(aq) ⟶ PbI2(s)
Lead iodide is a bright yellow solid that was formerly used as an artist’s pigment known as iodine yellow (Figure
4.4). The properties of pure PbI2 crystals make them useful for fabrication of X-ray and gamma ray detectors.
Figure 4.4 A precipitate of PbI2 forms when solutions containing Pb2+ and I− are mixed. (credit: Der Kreole/
Wikimedia Commons)
The solubility guidelines in Table 4.1 may be used to predict whether a precipitation reaction will occur when
solutions of soluble ionic compounds are mixed together. One merely needs to identify all the ions present in the
solution and then consider if possible cation/anion pairing could result in an insoluble compound. For example,
mixing solutions of silver nitrate and sodium fluoride will yield a solution containing Ag+, NO3 − , Na+, and F−
ions. Aside from the two ionic compounds originally present in the solutions, AgNO3 and NaF, two additional ionic
compounds may be derived from this collection of ions: NaNO3 and AgF. The solubility guidelines indicate all nitrate
salts are soluble but that AgF is one of the exceptions to the general solubility of fluoride salts. A precipitation
reaction, therefore, is predicted to occur, as described by the following equations:
NaF(aq) + AgNO3(aq) ⟶ AgF(s) + NaNO3(aq) (molecular)
Ag+(aq) + F−(aq) ⟶ AgF(s) (net ionic)

Answer: sodium sulfate, BaSO4
Acid-Base Reactions
An acid-base reaction is one in which a hydrogen ion, H+, is transferred from one chemical species to another.
Such reactions are of central importance to numerous natural and technological processes, ranging from the chemical
transformations that take place within cells and the lakes and oceans, to the industrial-scale production of fertilizers,
pharmaceuticals, and other substances essential to society. The subject of acid-base chemistry, therefore, is worthy of
thorough discussion, and a full chapter is devoted to this topic later in the text.
For purposes of this brief introduction, we will consider only the more common types of acid-base reactions that take
place in aqueous solutions. In this context, an acid is a substance that will dissolve in water to yield hydronium ions,
H3O+. As an example, consider the equation shown here:
HCl(aq) + H2 O(aq) ⟶ Cl−(aq) + H3 O+(aq)
The process represented by this equation confirms that hydrogen chloride is an acid. When dissolved in water, H3O+
ions are produced by a chemical reaction in which H+ ions are transferred from HCl molecules to H2O molecules
(Figure 4.5).
Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 185
Figure 4.5 When hydrogen chloride gas dissolves in water, (a) it reacts as an acid, transferring protons to water
molecules to yield (b) hydronium ions (and solvated chloride ions).
The nature of HCl is such that its reaction with water as just described is essentially 100% efficient: Virtually every
HCl molecule that dissolves in water will undergo this reaction. Acids that completely react in this fashion are called
strong acids, and HCl is one among just a handful of common acid compounds that are classified as strong (Table
4.2). A far greater number of compounds behave as weak acids and only partially react with water, leaving a large
majority of dissolved molecules in their original form and generating a relatively small amount of hydronium ions.
Weak acids are commonly encountered in nature, being the substances partly responsible for the tangy taste of citrus
fruits, the stinging sensation of insect bites, and the unpleasant smells associated with body odor. A familiar example
of a weak acid is acetic acid, the main ingredient in food vinegars:
CH3 CO2 H(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ CH3 CO2 −(aq) + H3 O+(aq)
When dissolved in water under typical conditions, only about 1% of acetic acid molecules are present in the ionized
form, CH3 CO2 − (Figure 4.6). (The use of a double-arrow in the equation above denotes the partial reaction aspect
of this process, a concept addressed fully in the chapters on chemical equilibrium.)

A base is a substance that will dissolve in water to yield hydroxide ions, OH−. The most common bases are ionic
compounds composed of alkali or alkaline earth metal cations (groups 1 and 2) combined with the hydroxide ion—for
example, NaOH and Ca(OH)2. Unlike the acid compounds discussed previously, these compounds do not react
chemically with water; instead they dissolve and dissociate, releasing hydroxide ions directly into the solution.
For example, KOH and Ba(OH)2 dissolve in water and dissociate completely to produce cations (K+ and Ba2+,
respectively) and hydroxide ions, OH−. These bases, along with other hydroxides that completely dissociate in water,
are considered strong bases.
Consider as an example the dissolution of lye (sodium hydroxide) in water:
NaOH(s) ⟶ Na+(aq) + OH−(aq)
This equation confirms that sodium hydroxide is a base. When dissolved in water, NaOH dissociates to yield Na+ and
OH− ions. This is also true for any other ionic compound containing hydroxide ions. Since the dissociation process
is essentially complete when ionic compounds dissolve in water under typical conditions, NaOH and other ionic
hydroxides are all classified as strong bases.
Unlike ionic hydroxides, some compounds produce hydroxide ions when dissolved by chemically reacting with water
Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 187
molecules. In all cases, these compounds react only partially and so are classified as weak bases. These types of
compounds are also abundant in nature and important commodities in various technologies. For example, global
production of the weak base ammonia is typically well over 100 metric tons annually, being widely used as an
agricultural fertilizer, a raw material for chemical synthesis of other compounds, and an active ingredient in household
cleaners (Figure 4.7). When dissolved in water, ammonia reacts partially to yield hydroxide ions, as shown here:
NH3(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ NH4 +(aq) + OH−(aq)
This is, by definition, an acid-base reaction, in this case involving the transfer of H+ ions from water molecules to
ammonia molecules. Under typical conditions, only about 1% of the dissolved ammonia is present as NH4 + ions.
Figure 4.7 Ammonia is a weak base used in a variety of applications. (a) Pure ammonia is commonly applied as an
agricultural fertilizer. (b) Dilute solutions of ammonia are effective household cleansers. (credit a: modification of work

A neutralization reaction is a specific type of acid-base reaction in which the reactants are an acid and a base (but
not water), and the products are often a salt and water
acid + base ⟶ salt + water
To illustrate a neutralization reaction, consider what happens when a typical antacid such as milk of magnesia (an
aqueous suspension of solid Mg(OH)2) is ingested to ease symptoms associated with excess stomach acid (HCl):
Mg(OH)2(s) + 2HCl(aq) ⟶ MgCl2(aq) + 2H2 O(l).
Note that in addition to water, this reaction produces a salt, magnesium chloride.

HOCl(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ OCl−(aq) + H3 O+(aq)
A double-arrow is appropriate in this equation because it indicates the HOCl is a weak acid that has not
reacted completely.

Stomach Antacids
Our stomachs contain a solution of roughly 0.03 M HCl, which helps us digest the food we eat. The burning
sensation associated with heartburn is a result of the acid of the stomach leaking through the muscular valve
at the top of the stomach into the lower reaches of the esophagus. The lining of the esophagus is not protected
from the corrosive effects of stomach acid the way the lining of the stomach is, and the results can be very
painful. When we have heartburn, it feels better if we reduce the excess acid in the esophagus by taking
an antacid. As you may have guessed, antacids are bases. One of the most common antacids is calcium
carbonate, CaCO3. The reaction,
CaCO3(s) + 2HCl(aq) ⇌ CaCl2(aq) + H2 O(l) + CO2(g)
not only neutralizes stomach acid, it also produces CO2(g), which may result in a satisfying belch.
Milk of Magnesia is a suspension of the sparingly soluble base magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)2. It works
according to the reaction:
Mg(OH)2(s) ⇌ Mg2+(aq) + 2OH−(aq)
The hydroxide ions generated in this equilibrium then go on to react with the hydronium ions from the stomach
acid, so that:
H3 O+ + OH− ⇌ 2H2 O(l)
This reaction does not produce carbon dioxide, but magnesium-containing antacids can have a laxative effect.
Several antacids have aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, as an active ingredient. The aluminum hydroxide tends
to cause constipation, and some antacids use aluminum hydroxide in concert with magnesium hydroxide to
balance the side effects of the two substances.
Culinary Aspects of Chemistry
Examples of acid-base chemistry are abundant in the culinary world. One example is the use of baking soda, or
sodium bicarbonate in baking. NaHCO3 is a base. When it reacts with an acid such as lemon juice, buttermilk,
or sour cream in a batter, bubbles of carbon dioxide gas are formed from decomposition of the resulting
carbonic acid, and the batter “rises.” Baking powder is a combination of sodium bicarbonate, and one or more
acid salts that react when the two chemicals come in contact with water in the batter.
Many people like to put lemon juice or vinegar, both of which are acids, on cooked fish (Figure 4.8). It turns

out that fish have volatile amines (bases) in their systems, which are neutralized by the acids to yield involatile
ammonium salts. This reduces the odor of the fish, and also adds a “sour” taste that we seem to enjoy.
Figure 4.8 A neutralization reaction takes place between citric acid in lemons or acetic acid in vinegar, and
the bases in the flesh of fish.
Pickling is a method used to preserve vegetables using a naturally produced acidic environment. The
vegetable, such as a cucumber, is placed in a sealed jar submerged in a brine solution. The brine solution
favors the growth of beneficial bacteria and suppresses the growth of harmful bacteria. The beneficial bacteria
feed on starches in the cucumber and produce lactic acid as a waste product in a process called fermentation.
The lactic acid eventually increases the acidity of the brine to a level that kills any harmful bacteria, which
require a basic environment. Without the harmful bacteria consuming the cucumbers they are able to last much
longer than if they were unprotected. A byproduct of the pickling process changes the flavor of the vegetables
with the acid making them taste sour.

Oxidation-Reduction Reactions
Earth’s atmosphere contains about 20% molecular oxygen, O2, a chemically reactive gas that plays an essential role in
the metabolism of aerobic organisms and in many environmental processes that shape the world. The term oxidation

was originally used to describe chemical reactions involving O2, but its meaning has evolved to refer to a broad and
important reaction class known as oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions. A few examples of such reactions will be
used to develop a clear picture of this classification.
Some redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons between reactant species to yield ionic products, such as the
reaction between sodium and chlorine to yield sodium chloride:
2Na(s) + Cl2(g) ⟶ 2NaCl(s)
It is helpful to view the process with regard to each individual reactant, that is, to represent the fate of each reactant
in the form of an equation called a half-reaction:
2Na(s) ⟶ 2Na+(s) + 2e−
Cl2(g) + 2e− ⟶ 2Cl−(s)
These equations show that Na atoms lose electrons while Cl atoms (in the Cl2 molecule) gain electrons, the “s”
subscripts for the resulting ions signifying they are present in the form of a solid ionic compound. For redox reactions
of this sort, the loss and gain of electrons define the complementary processes that occur:
oxidation = loss of electrons
reduction = gain of electrons
In this reaction, then, sodium is oxidized and chlorine undergoes reduction. Viewed from a more active perspective,
sodium functions as a reducing agent (reductant), since it provides electrons to (or reduces) chlorine. Likewise,
chlorine functions as an oxidizing agent (oxidant), as it effectively removes electrons from (oxidizes) sodium.
reducing agent = species that is oxidized
oxidizing agent = species that is reduced
Some redox processes, however, do not involve the transfer of electrons. Consider, for example, a reaction similar to
the one yielding NaCl:
H2(g) + Cl2(g) ⟶ 2HCl(g)
The product of this reaction is a covalent compound, so transfer of electrons in the explicit sense is not involved. To
clarify the similarity of this reaction to the previous one and permit an unambiguous definition of redox reactions,
a property called oxidation number has been defined. The oxidation number (or oxidation state) of an element in
a compound is the charge its atoms would possess if the compound was ionic. The following guidelines are used to
assign oxidation numbers to each element in a molecule or ion.
1. The oxidation number of an atom in an elemental substance is zero.
2. The oxidation number of a monatomic ion is equal to the ion’s charge.
3. Oxidation numbers for common nonmetals are usually assigned as follows:
• Hydrogen: +1 when combined with nonmetals, −1 when combined with metals
• Oxygen: −2 in most compounds, sometimes −1 (so-called peroxides, O2 2−), very rarely − 1
2 (so-
called superoxides, O2 −), positive values when combined with F (values vary)
• Halogens: −1 for F always, −1 for other halogens except when combined with oxygen or other
halogens (positive oxidation numbers in these cases, varying values)
4. The sum of oxidation numbers for all atoms in a molecule or polyatomic ion equals the charge on the molecule
or ion.
Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 191
Note: The proper convention for reporting charge is to write the number first, followed by the sign (e.g., 2+), while
oxidation number is written with the reversed sequence, sign followed by number (e.g., +2). This convention aims to
emphasize the distinction between these two related properties.
Example 4.5
Assigning Oxidation Numbers
Follow the guidelines in this section of the text to assign oxidation numbers to all the elements in the
following species:
(a) H2S
(b) SO3 2−
(c) Na2SO4
Solution
(a) According to guideline 1, the oxidation number for H is +1.
Using this oxidation number and the compound’s formula, guideline 4 may then be used to calculate the
oxidation number for sulfur:
charge on H2 S = 0 = (2 × +1) + (1 × x)
x = 0 − (2 × +1) = −2
(b) Guideline 3 suggests the oxidation number for oxygen is −2.
Using this oxidation number and the ion’s formula, guideline 4 may then be used to calculate the oxidation
number for sulfur:
charge on SO3 2− = −2 = (3 × −2) + (1 × x)
x = −2 − (3 × −2) = +4
(c) For ionic compounds, it’s convenient to assign oxidation numbers for the cation and anion separately.
According to guideline 2, the oxidation number for sodium is +1.
Assuming the usual oxidation number for oxygen (−2 per guideline 3), the oxidation number for sulfur is
calculated as directed by guideline 4:
charge on SO4 2− = −2 = (4 × −2) + (1 × x)
x = −2 − (4 × −2) = +6

Using the oxidation number concept, an all-inclusive definition of redox reaction has been established. Oxidation-
reduction (redox) reactions are those in which one or more elements involved undergo a change in oxidation
number. (While the vast majority of redox reactions involve changes in oxidation number for two or more elements,

a few interesting exceptions to this rule do exist Example 4.6.) Definitions for the complementary processes of this
reaction class are correspondingly revised as shown here:
oxidation = increase in oxidation number
reduction = decrease in oxidation number
Returning to the reactions used to introduce this topic, they may now both be identified as redox processes. In the
reaction between sodium and chlorine to yield sodium chloride, sodium is oxidized (its oxidation number increases
from 0 in Na to +1 in NaCl) and chlorine is reduced (its oxidation number decreases from 0 in Cl2 to −1 in NaCl). In
the reaction between molecular hydrogen and chlorine, hydrogen is oxidized (its oxidation number increases from 0
in H2 to +1 in HCl) and chlorine is reduced (its oxidation number decreases from 0 in Cl2 to −1 in HCl).
Several subclasses of redox reactions are recognized, including combustion reactions in which the reductant (also
called a fuel) and oxidant (often, but not necessarily, molecular oxygen) react vigorously and produce significant
amounts of heat, and often light, in the form of a flame. Solid rocket-fuel reactions such as the one depicted in Figure
4.1 are combustion processes. A typical propellant reaction in which solid aluminum is oxidized by ammonium
perchlorate is represented by this equation:
10Al(s) + 6NH4 ClO4(s) ⟶ 4Al2 O3(s) + 2AlCl3(s) + 12H2 O(g) + 3N2(g)
Watch a brief video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16hybridrocket) showing the test firing of a small-
scale, prototype, hybrid rocket engine planned for use in the new Space Launch System being developed
by NASA. The first engines firing at
3 s (green flame) use a liquid fuel/oxidant mixture, and the second, more powerful engines firing at 4 s
(yellow flame) use a solid mixture.
Single-displacement (replacement) reactions are redox reactions in which an ion in solution is displaced (or
replaced) via the oxidation of a metallic element. One common example of this type of reaction is the acid oxidation
of certain metals:
Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) ⟶ ZnCl2(aq) + H2(g)
Metallic elements may also be oxidized by solutions of other metal salts; for example:
Cu(s) + 2AgNO3(aq) ⟶ Cu (NO3)2(aq) + 2Ag(s)
This reaction may be observed by placing copper wire in a solution containing a dissolved silver salt. Silver ions in
solution are reduced to elemental silver at the surface of the copper wire, and the resulting Cu2+ ions dissolve in the
solution to yield a characteristic blue color (Figure 4.9).

Describing Redox Reactions

those reactions identified as redox, name the oxidant and reductant.

(e) C2 H4(g) + 3O2(g) ⟶ 2CO2(g) + 2H2 O(l)
Solution
Redox reactions are identified per definition if one or more elements undergo a change in oxidation number.
(a) This is not a redox reaction, since oxidation numbers remain unchanged for all elements.
(b) This is a redox reaction. Gallium is oxidized, its oxidation number increasing from 0 in Ga(l) to +3 in
GaBr3(s). The reducing agent is Ga(l). Bromine is reduced, its oxidation number decreasing from 0 in Br2(l)
to −1 in GaBr3(s). The oxidizing agent is Br2(l).
(c) This is a redox reaction. It is a particularly interesting process, as it involves the same element, oxygen,
undergoing both oxidation and reduction (a so-called disproportionation reaction). Oxygen is oxidized, its
oxidation number increasing from −1 in H2O2(aq) to 0 in O2(g). Oxygen is also reduced, its oxidation
number decreasing from −1 in H2O2(aq) to −2 in H2O(l). For disproportionation reactions, the same
substance functions as an oxidant and a reductant.
(d) This is not a redox reaction, since oxidation numbers remain unchanged for all elements.
(e) This is a redox reaction (combustion). Carbon is oxidized, its oxidation number increasing from −2 in
C2H4(g) to +4 in CO2(g). The reducing agent (fuel) is C2H4(g). Oxygen is reduced, its oxidation number
decreasing from 0 in O2(g) to −2 in H2O(l). The oxidizing agent is O2(g).

Balancing Redox Reactions via the Half-Reaction Method
Redox reactions that take place in aqueous media often involve water, hydronium ions, and hydroxide ions as
reactants or products. Although these species are not oxidized or reduced, they do participate in chemical change
in other ways (e.g., by providing the elements required to form oxyanions). Equations representing these reactions
are sometimes very difficult to balance by inspection, so systematic approaches have been developed to assist in the
process. One very useful approach is to use the method of half-reactions, which involves the following steps:
1. Write the two half-reactions representing the redox process.
2. Balance all elements except oxygen and hydrogen.
3. Balance oxygen atoms by adding H2O molecules.
4. Balance hydrogen atoms by adding H+ ions.
5. Balance charge by adding electrons.
6. If necessary, multiply each half-reaction’s coefficients by the smallest possible integers to yield equal numbers of
electrons in each.
7. Add the balanced half-reactions together and simplify by removing species that appear on both sides of the
equation.
8. For reactions occurring in basic media (excess hydroxide ions), carry out these additional steps:
a. Add OH− ions to both sides of the equation in numbers equal to the number of H+ ions.
b. On the side of the equation containing both H+ and OH− ions, combine these ions to yield water molecules.
c. Simplify the equation by removing any redundant water molecules.
9. Finally, check to see that both the number of atoms and the total charges[1] are balanced.
Example 4.7
Balancing Redox Reactions in Acidic Solution
Write a balanced equation for the reaction between dichromate ion and iron(II) to yield iron(III) and
chromium(III) in acidic solution.
Cr2 O7 2− + Fe2+ ⟶ Cr3+ + Fe3+
Solution
Step 1. Write the two half-reactions.
Each half-reaction will contain one reactant and one product with one element in common.
Fe2+ ⟶ Fe3+
Cr2 O7 2− ⟶ Cr3+
Step 2. Balance all elements except oxygen and hydrogen. The iron half-reaction is already
balanced, but the chromium half-reaction shows two Cr atoms on the left and one Cr atom on the
right. Changing the coefficient on the right side of the equation to 2 achieves balance with regard to
Cr atoms.
Fe2+ ⟶ Fe3+
Cr2 O7 2− ⟶ 2Cr3+
Step 3. Balance oxygen atoms by adding H2O molecules. The iron half-reaction does not contain
O atoms. The chromium half-reaction shows seven O atoms on the left and none on the right, so
1. The requirement of “charge balance” is just a specific type of “mass balance” in which the species in question are electrons. An equation
must represent equal numbers of electrons on the reactant and product sides, and so both atoms and charges must be balanced.
Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 195
seven water molecules are added to the right side.
Fe2+ ⟶ Fe3+
Cr2 O7 2− ⟶ 2Cr3+ + 7H2 O
Step 4. Balance hydrogen atoms by adding H+ions. The iron half-reaction does not contain H
atoms. The chromium half-reaction shows 14 H atoms on the right and none on the left, so 14
hydrogen ions are added to the left side.
Fe2+ ⟶ Fe3+
Cr2 O7 2− + 14H+ ⟶ 2Cr3+ + 7H2 O
Step 5. Balance charge by adding electrons. The iron half-reaction shows a total charge of 2+ on
the left side (1 Fe2+ ion) and 3+ on the right side (1 Fe3+ ion). Adding one electron to the right side
brings that side’s total charge to (3+) + (1−) = 2+, and charge balance is achieved.
The chromium half-reaction shows a total charge of (1 × 2−) + (14 × 1+) = 12+ on the left side
(1 Cr2 O7 2− ion and 14 H+ ions). The total charge on the right side is (2 × 3+) = 6 + (2 Cr3+ ions).
Adding six electrons to the left side will bring that side’s total charge to (12+ + 6−) = 6+, and charge
balance is achieved.
Fe2+ ⟶ Fe3+ + e−
Cr2 O7 2− + 14H+ + 6e− ⟶ 2Cr3+ + 7H2 O
Step 6. Multiply the two half-reactions so the number of electrons in one reaction equals the
number of electrons in the other reaction. To be consistent with mass conservation, and the idea that
redox reactions involve the transfer (not creation or destruction) of electrons, the iron half-reaction’s
coefficient must be multiplied by 6.
6Fe2+ ⟶ 6Fe3+ + 6e−
Cr2 O7 2− + 6e− + 14H+ ⟶ 2Cr3+ + 7H2 O
Step 7. Add the balanced half-reactions and cancel species that appear on both sides of the
equation.
6Fe2+ + Cr2 O7 2− + 6e− + 14H+ ⟶ 6Fe3+ + 6e− + 2Cr3+ + 7H2 O
Only the six electrons are redundant species. Removing them from each side of the equation yields
the simplified, balanced equation here:
6Fe2+ + Cr2 O7 2− + 14H+ ⟶ 6Fe3+ + 2Cr3+ + 7H2 O
A final check of atom and charge balance confirms the equation is balanced.

4.3 Reaction Stoichiometry
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the concept of stoichiometry as it pertains to chemical reactions
• Use balanced chemical equations to derive stoichiometric factors relating amounts of reactants and products
• Perform stoichiometric calculations involving mass, moles, and solution molarity
A balanced chemical equation provides a great deal of information in a very succinct format. Chemical formulas
provide the identities of the reactants and products involved in the chemical change, allowing classification of the
reaction. Coefficients provide the relative numbers of these chemical species, allowing a quantitative assessment
of the relationships between the amounts of substances consumed and produced by the reaction. These quantitative
relationships are known as the reaction’s stoichiometry, a term derived from the Greek words stoicheion (meaning
“element”) and metron (meaning “measure”). In this module, the use of balanced chemical equations for various
stoichiometric applications is explored.
The general approach to using stoichiometric relationships is similar in concept to the way people go about many
common activities. Food preparation, for example, offers an appropriate comparison. A recipe for making eight
pancakes calls for 1 cup pancake mix, 3
4 cup milk, and one egg. The “equation” representing the preparation of
pancakes per this recipe is
1 cup mix + 3
4 cup milk + 1 egg ⟶ 8 pancakes
If two dozen pancakes are needed for a big family breakfast, the ingredient amounts must be increased proportionally
according to the amounts given in the recipe. For example, the number of eggs required to make 24 pancakes is
24 pancakes × 1 egg
8 pancakes = 3 eggs
Balanced chemical equations are used in much the same fashion to determine the amount of one reactant required to
react with a given amount of another reactant, or to yield a given amount of product, and so forth. The coefficients in
the balanced equation are used to derive stoichiometric factors that permit computation of the desired quantity. To
illustrate this idea, consider the production of ammonia by reaction of hydrogen and nitrogen:
N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⟶ 2NH3(g)
This equation shows ammonia molecules are produced from hydrogen molecules in a 2:3 ratio, and stoichiometric
factors may be derived using any amount (number) unit:
Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 197
2 NH3 molecules
3 H2 molecules or 2 doz NH3 molecules
3 doz H2 molecules or 2 mol NH3 molecules
3 mol H2 molecules
These stoichiometric factors can be used to compute the number of ammonia molecules produced from a given
number of hydrogen molecules, or the number of hydrogen molecules required to produce a given number of
ammonia molecules. Similar factors may be derived for any pair of substances in any chemical equation.

The approach here is the same as for Example 4.8, though the absolute number of molecules is requested,
not the number of moles of molecules. This will simply require use of the moles-to-numbers conversion
factor, Avogadro’s number.
The balanced equation shows that carbon dioxide is produced from propane in a 3:1 ratio:
3 mol CO2
1 mol C3 H8
Using this stoichiometric factor, the provided molar amount of propane, and Avogadro’s number,
0.75 mol C3 H8 × 3 mol CO2

These examples illustrate the ease with which the amounts of substances involved in a chemical reaction of known
stoichiometry may be related. Directly measuring numbers of atoms and molecules is, however, not an easy task, and
the practical application of stoichiometry requires that we use the more readily measured property of mass.

Airbags
Airbags (Figure 4.12) are a safety feature provided in most automobiles since the 1990s. The effective
operation of an airbag requires that it be rapidly inflated with an appropriate amount (volume) of gas when the
vehicle is involved in a collision. This requirement is satisfied in many automotive airbag systems through use
of explosive chemical reactions, one common choice being the decomposition of sodium azide, NaN3. When
sensors in the vehicle detect a collision, an electrical current is passed through a carefully measured amount
of NaN3 to initiate its decomposition:
Chemistry in Everyday Life
Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 201
2NaN3(s) ⟶ 3N2(g) + 2Na(s)
This reaction is very rapid, generating gaseous nitrogen that can deploy and fully inflate a typical airbag in
a fraction of a second (~0.03–0.1 s). Among many engineering considerations, the amount of sodium azide

function. For example, a small mass (~100 g) of NaN3 will generate approximately 50 L of N2.

4.4 Reaction Yields
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the concepts of theoretical yield and limiting reactants/reagents.
• Derive the theoretical yield for a reaction under specified conditions.
• Calculate the percent yield for a reaction.
The relative amounts of reactants and products represented in a balanced chemical equation are often referred to as
stoichiometric amounts. All the exercises of the preceding module involved stoichiometric amounts of reactants. For
example, when calculating the amount of product generated from a given amount of reactant, it was assumed that any
other reactants required were available in stoichiometric amounts (or greater). In this module, more realistic situations
are considered, in which reactants are not present in stoichiometric amounts.
Limiting Reactant
Consider another food analogy, making grilled cheese sandwiches (Figure 4.13):
1 slice of cheese + 2 slices of bread ⟶ 1 sandwich
Stoichiometric amounts of sandwich ingredients for this recipe are bread and cheese slices in a 2:1 ratio. Provided
with 28 slices of bread and 11 slices of cheese, one may prepare 11 sandwiches per the provided recipe, using all the
provided cheese and having six slices of bread left over. In this scenario, the number of sandwiches prepared has been
limited by the number of cheese slices, and the bread slices have been provided in excess.

Figure 4.13 Sandwich making can illustrate the concepts of limiting and excess reactants.
Consider this concept now with regard to a chemical process, the reaction of hydrogen with chlorine to yield hydrogen
chloride:
H2(g) + Cl2(g) ⟶ 2HCl(g)
The balanced equation shows the hydrogen and chlorine react in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. If these reactants are
provided in any other amounts, one of the reactants will nearly always be entirely consumed, thus limiting the amount
of product that may be generated. This substance is the limiting reactant, and the other substance is the excess
reactant. Identifying the limiting and excess reactants for a given situation requires computing the molar amounts
of each reactant provided and comparing them to the stoichiometric amounts represented in the balanced chemical
equation. For example, imagine combining 3 moles of H2 and 2 moles of Cl2. This represents a 3:2 (or 1.5:1) ratio of
hydrogen to chlorine present for reaction, which is greater than the stoichiometric ratio of 1:1. Hydrogen, therefore,
is present in excess, and chlorine is the limiting reactant. Reaction of all the provided chlorine (2 mol) will consume
2 mol of the 3 mol of hydrogen provided, leaving 1 mol of hydrogen unreacted.
An alternative approach to identifying the limiting reactant involves comparing the amount of product expected for
the complete reaction of each reactant. Each reactant amount is used to separately calculate the amount of product that
would be formed per the reaction’s stoichiometry. The reactant yielding the lesser amount of product is the limiting
reactant. For the example in the previous paragraph, complete reaction of the hydrogen would yield
mol HCl produced = 3 mol H2 × 2 mol HCl
1 mol H2
= 6 mol HCl
Complete reaction of the provided chlorine would produce
mol HCl produced = 2 mol Cl2 × 2 mol HCl
1 mol Cl2
= 4 mol HCl
The chlorine will be completely consumed once 4 moles of HCl have been produced. Since enough hydrogen
was provided to yield 6 moles of HCl, there will be unreacted hydrogen remaining once this reaction is complete.
Chlorine, therefore, is the limiting reactant and hydrogen is the excess reactant (Figure 4.14).
Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 203
Figure 4.14 When H2 and Cl2 are combined in nonstoichiometric amounts, one of these reactants will limit the
amount of HCl that can be produced. This illustration shows a reaction in which hydrogen is present in excess and
chlorine is the limiting reactant.

Example 4.12
Identifying the Limiting Reactant
Silicon nitride is a very hard, high-temperature-resistant ceramic used as a component of turbine blades in
jet engines. It is prepared according to the following equation:
3Si(s) + 2N2(g) ⟶ Si3 N4(s)
Which is the limiting reactant when 2.00 g of Si and 1.50 g of N2 react?
Solution
Compute the provided molar amounts of reactants, and then compare these amounts to the balanced
equation to identify the limiting reactant.
mol Si = 2.00 g Si × 1 mol Si
28.09 g Si = 0.0712 mol Si
mol N2 = 1.50 g N2 × 1 mol N2
28.02 g N2
= 0.0535 mol N2
The provided Si:N2 molar ratio is:
0.0712 mol Si
0.0535 mol N2
= 1.33 mol Si
1 mol N2
The stoichiometric Si:N2 ratio is:

3 mol Si
2 mol N2
= 1.5 mol Si
1 mol N2
Comparing these ratios shows that Si is provided in a less-than-stoichiometric amount, and so is the limiting
reactant.
Alternatively, compute the amount of product expected for complete reaction of each of the provided
reactants. The 0.0712 moles of silicon would yield
mol Si3 N4 produced = 0.0712 mol Si × 1 mol Si3 N4
3 mol Si = 0.0237 mol Si3 N4
while the 0.0535 moles of nitrogen would produce
mol Si3 N4 produced = 0.0535 mol N2 × 1 mol Si3 N4
2 mol N2
= 0.0268 mol Si3 N4
Since silicon yields the lesser amount of product, it is the limiting reactant.

Answer: O2
Percent Yield
The amount of product that may be produced by a reaction under specified conditions, as calculated per the
stoichiometry of an appropriate balanced chemical equation, is called the theoretical yield of the reaction. In practice,
the amount of product obtained is called the actual yield, and it is often less than the theoretical yield for a number of
reasons. Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products.
Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this
chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the
actual yield. The extent to which a reaction’s theoretical yield is achieved is commonly expressed as its percent yield:
percent yield = actual yield
theoretical yield × 100%
Actual and theoretical yields may be expressed as masses or molar amounts (or any other appropriate property; e.g.,
volume, if the product is a gas). As long as both yields are expressed using the same units, these units will cancel
when percent yield is calculated.
Example 4.13
Calculation of Percent Yield
Upon reaction of 1.274 g of copper sulfate with excess zinc metal, 0.392 g copper metal was obtained
according to the equation:
CuSO4(aq) + Zn(s) ⟶ Cu(s) + ZnSO4(aq)
What is the percent yield?
Solution
The provided information identifies copper sulfate as the limiting reactant, and so the theoretical yield is
found by the approach illustrated in the previous module, as shown here:
Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 205
1.274 g CuSO4 × 1 mol CuSO4
159.62 g CuSO4
× 1 mol Cu
1 mol CuSO4
× 63.55 g Cu
1 mol Cu = 0.5072 g Cu
Using this theoretical yield and the provided value for actual yield, the percent yield is calculated to be
percent yield = ⎛
⎝ actual yield
theoretical yield
⎞
⎠ × 100
percent yield = ⎛
⎝ 0.392 g Cu

Green Chemistry and Atom Economy
The purposeful design of chemical products and processes that minimize the use of environmentally
hazardous substances and the generation of waste is known as green chemistry. Green chemistry is a
philosophical approach that is being applied to many areas of science and technology, and its practice is
summarized by guidelines known as the “Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry” (see details at this website
(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16greenchem) ). One of the 12 principles is aimed specifically at maximizing
the efficiency of processes for synthesizing chemical products. The atom economy of a process is a measure
of this efficiency, defined as the percentage by mass of the final product of a synthesis relative to the masses
of all the reactants used:
atom economy = mass of product
mass of reactants × 100%
Though the definition of atom economy at first glance appears very similar to that for percent yield, be
aware that this property represents a difference in the theoretical efficiencies of different chemical processes.
The percent yield of a given chemical process, on the other hand, evaluates the efficiency of a process by
comparing the yield of product actually obtained to the maximum yield predicted by stoichiometry.
The synthesis of the common nonprescription pain medication, ibuprofen, nicely illustrates the success of a
green chemistry approach (Figure 4.15). First marketed in the early 1960s, ibuprofen was produced using
a six-step synthesis that required 514 g of reactants to generate each mole (206 g) of ibuprofen, an atom
economy of 40%. In the 1990s, an alternative process was developed by the BHC Company (now BASF
Corporation) that requires only three steps and has an atom economy of ~80%, nearly twice that of the original
process. The BHC process generates significantly less chemical waste; uses less-hazardous and recyclable
materials; and provides significant cost-savings to the manufacturer (and, subsequently, the consumer). In
recognition of the positive environmental impact of the BHC process, the company received the Environmental
Protection Agency’s Greener Synthetic Pathways Award in 1997.

4.5 Quantitative Chemical Analysis
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the fundamental aspects of titrations and gravimetric analysis.
• Perform stoichiometric calculations using typical titration and gravimetric data.
In the 18th century, the strength (actually the concentration) of vinegar samples was determined by noting the amount
of potassium carbonate, K2CO3, which had to be added, a little at a time, before bubbling ceased. The greater the
weight of potassium carbonate added to reach the point where the bubbling ended, the more concentrated the vinegar.
We now know that the effervescence that occurred during this process was due to reaction with acetic acid, CH3CO2H,
the compound primarily responsible for the odor and taste of vinegar. Acetic acid reacts with potassium carbonate
according to the following equation:
Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 207
2CH3 CO2 H(aq) + K2 CO3(s) ⟶ 2CH3 CO2 K(aq) + CO2(g) + H2 O(l)
The bubbling was due to the production of CO2.
The test of vinegar with potassium carbonate is one type of quantitative analysis—the determination of the amount
or concentration of a substance in a sample. In the analysis of vinegar, the concentration of the solute (acetic acid)
was determined from the amount of reactant that combined with the solute present in a known volume of the solution.
In other types of chemical analyses, the amount of a substance present in a sample is determined by measuring the
amount of product that results.
Titration
The described approach to measuring vinegar strength was an early version of the analytical technique known as
titration analysis. A typical titration analysis involves the use of a buret (Figure 4.16) to make incremental
additions of a solution containing a known concentration of some substance (the titrant) to a sample solution
containing the substance whose concentration is to be measured (the analyte). The titrant and analyte undergo a
chemical reaction of known stoichiometry, and so measuring the volume of titrant solution required for complete
reaction with the analyte (the equivalence point of the titration) allows calculation of the analyte concentration. The
equivalence point of a titration may be detected visually if a distinct change in the appearance of the sample solution
accompanies the completion of the reaction. The halt of bubble formation in the classic vinegar analysis is one such
example, though, more commonly, special dyes called indicators are added to the sample solutions to impart a change
in color at or very near the equivalence point of the titration. Equivalence points may also be detected by measuring
some solution property that changes in a predictable way during the course of the titration. Regardless of the approach
taken to detect a titration’s equivalence point, the volume of titrant actually measured is called the end point. Properly
designed titration methods typically ensure that the difference between the equivalence and end points is negligible.
Though any type of chemical reaction may serve as the basis for a titration analysis, the three described in this chapter
(precipitation, acid-base, and redox) are most common. Additional details regarding titration analysis are provided in
the chapter on acid-base equilibria.

Example 4.14
Titration Analysis
The end point in a titration of a 50.00-mL sample of aqueous HCl was reached by addition of 35.23 mL of
0.250 M NaOH titrant. The titration reaction is:
HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) ⟶ NaCl(aq) + H2 O(l)
What is the molarity of the HCl?
Solution
As for all reaction stoichiometry calculations, the key issue is the relation between the molar amounts of
the chemical species of interest as depicted in the balanced chemical equation. The approach outlined in
previous modules of this chapter is followed, with additional considerations required, since the amounts of
reactants provided and requested are expressed as solution concentrations.
For this exercise, the calculation will follow the following outlined steps:
Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 209
The molar amount of HCl is calculated to be:
35.23 mL NaOH × 1 L
1000 mL × 0.250 mol NaOH
1 L × 1 mol HCl
1 mol NaOH = 8.81 × 10−3 mol HCl
Using the provided volume of HCl solution and the definition of molarity, the HCl concentration is:
M = mol HCl
L solution
M = 8.81 × 10−3 mol HCl
50.00 mL × 1 L
1000 mL
M = 0.176 M

equal to the number of millimoles of solute per milliliter of solution:
M = mol solute

1 mmol NaOH

Answer: 0.2648 M
Gravimetric Analysis
A gravimetric analysis is one in which a sample is subjected to some treatment that causes a change in the physical
state of the analyte that permits its separation from the other components of the sample. Mass measurements of
the sample, the isolated analyte, or some other component of the analysis system, used along with the known
stoichiometry of the compounds involved, permit calculation of the analyte concentration. Gravimetric methods were
the first techniques used for quantitative chemical analysis, and they remain important tools in the modern chemistry
laboratory.

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
The required change of state in a gravimetric analysis may be achieved by various physical and chemical processes.
For example, the moisture (water) content of a sample is routinely determined by measuring the mass of a sample
before and after it is subjected to a controlled heating process that evaporates the water. Also common are gravimetric
techniques in which the analyte is subjected to a precipitation reaction of the sort described earlier in this chapter.
The precipitate is typically isolated from the reaction mixture by filtration, carefully dried, and then weighed (Figure
4.17). The mass of the precipitate may then be used, along with relevant stoichiometric relationships, to calculate
analyte concentration.
Figure 4.17 Precipitate may be removed from a reaction mixture by filtration.

What is the concentration (mass percent) of MgSO4 in the mixture?
Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 211
Solution
The plan for this calculation is similar to others used in stoichiometric calculations, the central step being
the connection between the moles of BaSO4 and MgSO4 through their stoichiometric factor. Once the mass
of MgSO4 is computed, it may be used along with the mass of the sample mixture to calculate the requested
percentage concentration.
The mass of MgSO4 that would yield the provided precipitate mass is
0.6168 g BaSO4 × 1 mol BaSO4
233.43 g BaSO4
× 1 mol MgSO4
1 mol BaSO4

The elemental composition of hydrocarbons and related compounds may be determined via a gravimetric method
known as combustion analysis. In a combustion analysis, a weighed sample of the compound is heated to a high
temperature under a stream of oxygen gas, resulting in its complete combustion to yield gaseous products of known
identities. The complete combustion of hydrocarbons, for example, will yield carbon dioxide and water as the only
products. The gaseous combustion products are swept through separate, preweighed collection devices containing
compounds that selectively absorb each product (Figure 4.18). The mass increase of each device corresponds to the
mass of the absorbed product and may be used in an appropriate stoichiometric calculation to derive the mass of the
relevant element.

determining the carbon and hydrogen content of a sample.
Example 4.16
Combustion Analysis
Polyethylene is a hydrocarbon polymer used to produce food-storage bags and many other flexible plastic
items. A combustion analysis of a 0.00126-g sample of polyethylene yields 0.00394 g of CO2 and 0.00161
g of H2O. What is the empirical formula of polyethylene?
Solution
The primary assumption in this exercise is that all the carbon in the sample combusted is converted to carbon
dioxide, and all the hydrogen in the sample is converted to water:
Cx Hy(s) + excess O 2(g) ⟶ xCO2(g) + y
2H2 O(g)
Note that a balanced equation is not necessary for the task at hand. To derive the empirical formula of the
compound, only the subscripts x and y are needed.
First, calculate the molar amounts of carbon and hydrogen in the sample, using the provided masses of the
carbon dioxide and water, respectively. With these molar amounts, the empirical formula for the compound
may be written as described in the previous chapter of this text. An outline of this approach is given in the
following flow chart:
Chapter 4 | Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions 213
mol C = 0.00394 g CO2 × 1 mol CO2
44.01 g × 1 mol C
1 mol CO2
= 8.95 × 10−5 mol C
mol H = 0.00161 g H2 O × 1 mol H2 O
18.02 g × 2 mol H
1 mol H2 O = 1.79 × 10−4 mol H
The empirical formula for the compound is then derived by identifying the smallest whole-number multiples
for these molar amounts. The H-to-C molar ratio is
mol H
mol C = 1.79 × 10−4 mol H
8.95 × 10−5 mol C = 2 mol H

Summary
4.1 Writing and Balancing Chemical Equations
Chemical equations are symbolic representations of chemical and physical changes. Formulas for the substances
undergoing the change (reactants) and substances generated by the change (products) are separated by an arrow and
preceded by integer coefficients indicating their relative numbers. Balanced equations are those whose coefficients
result in equal numbers of atoms for each element in the reactants and products. Chemical reactions in aqueous
solution that involve ionic reactants or products may be represented more realistically by complete ionic equations
and, more succinctly, by net ionic equations.
4.2 Classifying Chemical Reactions
Chemical reactions are classified according to similar patterns of behavior. A large number of important reactions are
included in three categories: precipitation, acid-base, and oxidation-reduction (redox). Precipitation reactions involve
the formation of one or more insoluble products. Acid-base reactions involve the transfer of hydrogen ions between
reactants. Redox reactions involve a change in oxidation number for one or more reactant elements. Writing balanced
equations for some redox reactions that occur in aqueous solutions is simplified by using a systematic approach called
the half-reaction method.
4.3 Reaction Stoichiometry
A balanced chemical equation may be used to describe a reaction’s stoichiometry (the relationships between amounts
of reactants and products). Coefficients from the equation are used to derive stoichiometric factors that subsequently
may be used for computations relating reactant and product masses, molar amounts, and other quantitative properties.
4.4 Reaction Yields
When reactions are carried out using less-than-stoichiometric quantities of reactants, the amount of product generated
will be determined by the limiting reactant. The amount of product generated by a chemical reaction is its actual yield.
This yield is often less than the amount of product predicted by the stoichiometry of the balanced chemical equation
representing the reaction (its theoretical yield). The extent to which a reaction generates the theoretical amount of
product is expressed as its percent yield.
4.5 Quantitative Chemical Analysis
The stoichiometry of chemical reactions may serve as the basis for quantitative chemical analysis methods. Titrations
involve measuring the volume of a titrant solution required to completely react with a sample solution. This volume
is then used to calculate the concentration of analyte in the sample using the stoichiometry of the titration reaction.
Gravimetric analysis involves separating the analyte from the sample by a physical or chemical process, determining
its mass, and then calculating its concentration in the sample based on the stoichiometry of the relevant process.
Combustion analysis is a gravimetric method used to determine the elemental composition of a compound by
collecting and weighing the gaseous products of its combustion.

Introduction
Chemical reactions, such as those that occur when you light a match, involve changes in energy as well as matter.
Societies at all levels of development could not function without the energy released by chemical reactions. In 2012,
about 85% of US energy consumption came from the combustion of petroleum products, coal, wood, and garbage. We
use this energy to produce electricity (38%); to transport food, raw materials, manufactured goods, and people (27%);
for industrial production (21%); and to heat and power our homes and businesses (10%).[1] While these combustion
reactions help us meet our essential energy needs, they are also recognized by the majority of the scientific community
as a major contributor to global climate change.
Useful forms of energy are also available from a variety of chemical reactions other than combustion. For example,
the energy produced by the batteries in a cell phone, car, or flashlight results from chemical reactions. This chapter
introduces many of the basic ideas necessary to explore the relationships between chemical changes and energy, with
a focus on thermal energy.

5.1 Energy Basics
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define energy, distinguish types of energy, and describe the nature of energy changes that accompany
chemical and physical changes
• Distinguish the related properties of heat, thermal energy, and temperature
• Define and distinguish specific heat and heat capacity, and describe the physical implications of both
• Perform calculations involving heat, specific heat, and temperature change
Chemical changes and their accompanying changes in energy are important parts of our everyday world (Figure
5.2). The macronutrients in food (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates) undergo metabolic reactions that provide the
energy to keep our bodies functioning. We burn a variety of fuels (gasoline, natural gas, coal) to produce energy
for transportation, heating, and the generation of electricity. Industrial chemical reactions use enormous amounts of
energy to produce raw materials (such as iron and aluminum). Energy is then used to manufacture those raw materials
into useful products, such as cars, skyscrapers, and bridges.
Figure 5.2 The energy involved in chemical changes is important to our daily lives: (a) A cheeseburger for lunch
provides the energy you need to get through the rest of the day; (b) the combustion of gasoline provides the energy
that moves your car (and you) between home, work, and school; and (c) coke, a processed form of coal, provides the
energy needed to convert iron ore into iron, which is essential for making many of the products we use daily. (credit a:

Over 90% of the energy we use comes originally from the sun. Every day, the sun provides the earth with almost
10,000 times the amount of energy necessary to meet all of the world’s energy needs for that day. Our challenge is to
find ways to convert and store incoming solar energy so that it can be used in reactions or chemical processes that are
both convenient and nonpolluting. Plants and many bacteria capture solar energy through photosynthesis. We release
the energy stored in plants when we burn wood or plant products such as ethanol. We also use this energy to fuel our
bodies by eating food that comes directly from plants or from animals that got their energy by eating plants. Burning
coal and petroleum also releases stored solar energy: These fuels are fossilized plant and animal matter.
This chapter will introduce the basic ideas of an important area of science concerned with the amount of heat absorbed
or released during chemical and physical changes—an area called thermochemistry. The concepts introduced in
this chapter are widely used in almost all scientific and technical fields. Food scientists use them to determine the
energy content of foods. Biologists study the energetics of living organisms, such as the metabolic combustion of
sugar into carbon dioxide and water. The oil, gas, and transportation industries, renewable energy providers, and many
others endeavor to find better methods to produce energy for our commercial and personal needs. Engineers strive
to improve energy efficiency, find better ways to heat and cool our homes, refrigerate our food and drinks, and meet
the energy and cooling needs of computers and electronics, among other applications. Understanding thermochemical
principles is essential for chemists, physicists, biologists, geologists, every type of engineer, and just about anyone

Energy
Energy can be defined as the capacity to supply heat or do work. One type of work (w) is the process of causing
matter to move against an opposing force. For example, we do work when we inflate a bicycle tire—we move matter
(the air in the pump) against the opposing force of the air already in the tire.
Like matter, energy comes in different types. One scheme classifies energy into two types: potential energy, the
energy an object has because of its relative position, composition, or condition, and kinetic energy, the energy that
an object possesses because of its motion. Water at the top of a waterfall or dam has potential energy because of its
position; when it flows downward through generators, it has kinetic energy that can be used to do work and produce
electricity in a hydroelectric plant (Figure 5.3). A battery has potential energy because the chemicals within it can
produce electricity that can do work.
Figure 5.3 (a) Water at a higher elevation, for example, at the top of Victoria Falls, has a higher potential energy
than water at a lower elevation. As the water falls, some of its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. (b) If
the water flows through generators at the bottom of a dam, such as the Hoover Dam shown here, its kinetic energy is
converted into electrical energy. (credit a: modification of work by Steve Jurvetson; credit b: modification of work by
“curimedia”/Wikimedia commons)
Energy can be converted from one form into another, but all of the energy present before a change occurs always
exists in some form after the change is completed. This observation is expressed in the law of conservation of energy:
during a chemical or physical change, energy can be neither created nor destroyed, although it can be changed in
form. (This is also one version of the first law of thermodynamics, as you will learn later.)
When one substance is converted into another, there is always an associated conversion of one form of energy into
another. Heat is usually released or absorbed, but sometimes the conversion involves light, electrical energy, or
some other form of energy. For example, chemical energy (a type of potential energy) is stored in the molecules
that compose gasoline. When gasoline is combusted within the cylinders of a car’s engine, the rapidly expanding
gaseous products of this chemical reaction generate mechanical energy (a type of kinetic energy) when they move the
cylinders’ pistons.
According to the law of conservation of matter (seen in an earlier chapter), there is no detectable change in the
total amount of matter during a chemical change. When chemical reactions occur, the energy changes are relatively
modest and the mass changes are too small to measure, so the laws of conservation of matter and energy hold well.
However, in nuclear reactions, the energy changes are much larger (by factors of a million or so), the mass changes
are measurable, and matter-energy conversions are significant. This will be examined in more detail in a later chapter
Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 233
on nuclear chemistry.
Thermal Energy, Temperature, and Heat
Thermal energy is kinetic energy associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules. Temperature is a
quantitative measure of “hot” or “cold.” When the atoms and molecules in an object are moving or vibrating quickly,
they have a higher average kinetic energy (KE), and we say that the object is “hot.” When the atoms and molecules
are moving slowly, they have lower average KE, and we say that the object is “cold” (Figure 5.4). Assuming that no
chemical reaction or phase change (such as melting or vaporizing) occurs, increasing the amount of thermal energy
in a sample of matter will cause its temperature to increase. And, assuming that no chemical reaction or phase change
(such as condensation or freezing) occurs, decreasing the amount of thermal energy in a sample of matter will cause
its temperature to decrease.
Figure 5.4 (a) The molecules in a sample of hot water move more rapidly than (b) those in a sample of cold water.

Most substances expand as their temperature increases and contract as their temperature decreases. This property can
be used to measure temperature changes, as shown in Figure 5.5. The operation of many thermometers depends on
the expansion and contraction of substances in response to temperature changes.

different metals (such as brass and steel) form a two-layered strip. When heated or cooled, one of the metals (brass)

have a calibrated scale that indicates the temperature. (credit a: modification of work by “dwstucke”/Flickr)
The following demonstration (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16Bimetallic) allows one to view the effects
of heating and cooling a coiled bimetallic strip.
Heat (q) is the transfer of thermal energy between two bodies at different temperatures. Heat flow (a redundant term,
but one commonly used) increases the thermal energy of one body and decreases the thermal energy of the other.
Suppose we initially have a high temperature (and high thermal energy) substance (H) and a low temperature (and low
thermal energy) substance (L). The atoms and molecules in H have a higher average KE than those in L. If we place
substance H in contact with substance L, the thermal energy will flow spontaneously from substance H to substance L.
The temperature of substance H will decrease, as will the average KE of its molecules; the temperature of substance
L will increase, along with the average KE of its molecules. Heat flow will continue until the two substances are at
the same temperature (Figure 5.6).

Figure 5.6 (a) Substances H and L are initially at different temperatures, and their atoms have different average
kinetic energies. (b) When they contact each other, collisions between the molecules result in the transfer of kinetic
(thermal) energy from the hotter to the cooler matter. (c) The two objects reach “thermal equilibrium” when both
substances are at the same temperature and their molecules have the same average kinetic energy.

Matter undergoing chemical reactions and physical changes can release or absorb heat. A change that releases heat is
called an exothermic process. For example, the combustion reaction that occurs when using an oxyacetylene torch
is an exothermic process—this process also releases energy in the form of light as evidenced by the torch’s flame
(Figure 5.7). A reaction or change that absorbs heat is an endothermic process. A cold pack used to treat muscle
strains provides an example of an endothermic process. When the substances in the cold pack (water and a salt like
ammonium nitrate) are brought together, the resulting process absorbs heat, leading to the sensation of cold.

Historically, energy was measured in units of calories (cal). A calorie is the amount of energy required to raise one
gram of water by 1 degree C (1 kelvin). However, this quantity depends on the atmospheric pressure and the starting
temperature of the water. The ease of measurement of energy changes in calories has meant that the calorie is still
frequently used. The Calorie (with a capital C), or large calorie, commonly used in quantifying food energy content,
is a kilocalorie. The SI unit of heat, work, and energy is the joule. A joule (J) is defined as the amount of energy
used when a force of 1 newton moves an object 1 meter. It is named in honor of the English physicist James Prescott
Joule. One joule is equivalent to 1 kg m2/s2, which is also called 1 newton–meter. A kilojoule (kJ) is 1000 joules. To
standardize its definition, 1 calorie has been set to equal 4.184 joules.
We now introduce two concepts useful in describing heat flow and temperature change. The heat capacity (C) of a
body of matter is the quantity of heat (q) it absorbs or releases when it experiences a temperature change (ΔT) of 1
degree Celsius (or equivalently, 1 kelvin):
C = q
ΔT
Heat capacity is determined by both the type and amount of substance that absorbs or releases heat. It is therefore an
extensive property—its value is proportional to the amount of the substance.
For example, consider the heat capacities of two cast iron frying pans. The heat capacity of the large pan is five times
greater than that of the small pan because, although both are made of the same material, the mass of the large pan
is five times greater than the mass of the small pan. More mass means more atoms are present in the larger pan, so
it takes more energy to make all of those atoms vibrate faster. The heat capacity of the small cast iron frying pan is
found by observing that it takes 18,150 J of energy to raise the temperature of the pan by 50.0 °C:
Csmall pan = 18,140 J
50.0 °C = 363 J/°C
The larger cast iron frying pan, while made of the same substance, requires 90,700 J of energy to raise its temperature
by 50.0 °C. The larger pan has a (proportionally) larger heat capacity because the larger amount of material requires
a (proportionally) larger amount of energy to yield the same temperature change:
Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 237
Clarge pan = 90,700 J
50.0 °C = 1814 J/°C
The specific heat capacity (c) of a substance, commonly called its “specific heat,” is the quantity of heat required to
raise the temperature of 1 gram of a substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin):
c = q
mΔT
Specific heat capacity depends only on the kind of substance absorbing or releasing heat. It is an intensive
property—the type, but not the amount, of the substance is all that matters. For example, the small cast iron frying
pan has a mass of 808 g. The specific heat of iron (the material used to make the pan) is therefore:
ciron = 18,140 J
(808 g)(50.0 °C) = 0.449 J/g °C
The large frying pan has a mass of 4040 g. Using the data for this pan, we can also calculate the specific heat of iron:
ciron = 90,700 J
(4040 g)(50.0 °C) = 0.449 J/g °C
Although the large pan is more massive than the small pan, since both are made of the same material, they both yield
the same value for specific heat (for the material of construction, iron). Note that specific heat is measured in units of
energy per temperature per mass and is an intensive property, being derived from a ratio of two extensive properties
(heat and mass). The molar heat capacity, also an intensive property, is the heat capacity per mole of a particular
substance and has units of J/mol °C (Figure 5.8).
Figure 5.8 Because of its larger mass, a large frying pan has a larger heat capacity than a small frying pan.
Because they are made of the same material, both frying pans have the same specific heat. (credit: Mark Blaser)
water has a relatively high specific heat (about 4.2 J/g °C for the liquid and 2.09 J/g °C for the solid)); most metals
have much lower specific heats (usually less than 1 J/g °C). The specific heat of a substance varies somewhat with
temperature. However, this variation is usually small enough that we will treat specific heat as constant over the range
of temperatures that will be considered in this chapter. Specific heats of some common substances are listed in Table
5.1.

Table 5.1
If we know the mass of a substance and its specific heat, we can determine the amount of heat, q, entering or leaving
the substance by measuring the temperature change before and after the heat is gained or lost:
q = (specific heat) × (mass of substance) × (temperature change)
q = c × m × ΔT = c × m × (Tfinal − Tinitial)
In this equation, c is the specific heat of the substance, m is its mass, and ΔT (which is read “delta T”) is the
temperature change, Tfinal − Tinitial. If a substance gains thermal energy, its temperature increases, its final temperature
is higher than its initial temperature, Tfinal − Tinitial has a positive value, and the value of q is positive. If a substance
loses thermal energy, its temperature decreases, the final temperature is lower than the initial temperature, Tfinal −
Tinitial has a negative value, and the value of q is negative.
Example 5.1
Measuring Heat
A flask containing 8.0 × 102 g of water is heated, and the temperature of the water increases from 21 °C to
85 °C. How much heat did the water absorb?
Solution
To answer this question, consider these factors:
• the specific heat of the substance being heated (in this case, water)
• the amount of substance being heated (in this case, 8.0 × 102 g)
• the magnitude of the temperature change (in this case, from 21 °C to 85 °C).
The specific heat of water is 4.184 J/g °C, so to heat 1 g of water by 1 °C requires 4.184 J. We note that
since 4.184 J is required to heat 1 g of water by 1 °C, we will need 800 times as much to heat 8.0 × 102 g of
water by 1 °C. Finally, we observe that since 4.184 J are required to heat 1 g of water by 1 °C, we will need
Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 239
64 times as much to heat it by 64 °C (that is, from 21 °C to 85 °C).
This can be summarized using the equation:
q = c × m × ΔT = c × m × (Tfinal − Tinitial)
= (4.184 J/ g °C) × (8.0 x 102 g) × (85 − 21) °C
= (4.184 J/ g °C) × (8.0 x 102 g) × (64) °C
= 210,000 J ( = 2.1 × 102 kJ)
Because the temperature increased, the water absorbed heat and q is positive.

°C to 250 °C? The specific heat of iron is 0.449 J/g °C.
Answer: 5.07 × 104 J
Note that the relationship between heat, specific heat, mass, and temperature change can be used to determine any of
these quantities (not just heat) if the other three are known or can be deduced.
Example 5.2
Determining Other Quantities
A piece of unknown metal weighs 348 g. When the metal piece absorbs 6.64 kJ of heat, its temperature
increases from 22.4 °C to 43.6 °C. Determine the specific heat of this metal (which might provide a clue to
its identity).
Solution
Since mass, heat, and temperature change are known for this metal, we can determine its specific heat using
the relationship:
q = c × m × ΔT = c × m × (Tfinal − Tinitial)
Substituting the known values:
6640 J = c × (348 g) × (43.6 − 22.4) °C
Solving:
c = 6640 J
(348 g) × (21.2 °C) = 0.900 J/g °C
Comparing this value with the values in Table 5.1, this value matches the specific heat of aluminum, which
suggests that the unknown metal may be aluminum.

heat some substance; the heat “stored” in that substance is then converted into electricity.
The Solana Generating Station in Arizona’s Sonora Desert produces 280 megawatts of electrical power. It
uses parabolic mirrors that focus sunlight on pipes filled with a heat transfer fluid (HTF) (Figure 5.9). The HTF
then does two things: It turns water into steam, which spins turbines, which in turn produces electricity, and it
melts and heats a mixture of salts, which functions as a thermal energy storage system. After the sun goes
down, the molten salt mixture can then release enough of its stored heat to produce steam to run the turbines
for 6 hours. Molten salts are used because they possess a number of beneficial properties, including high heat
capacities and thermal conductivities.

The 377-megawatt Ivanpah Solar Generating System, located in the Mojave Desert in California, is the largest
solar thermal power plant in the world (Figure 5.10). Its 170,000 mirrors focus huge amounts of sunlight on
three water-filled towers, producing steam at over 538 °C that drives electricity-producing turbines. It produces
enough energy to power 140,000 homes. Water is used as the working fluid because of its large heat capacity
and heat of vaporization.

5.2 Calorimetry
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the technique of calorimetry
• Calculate and interpret heat and related properties using typical calorimetry data
One technique we can use to measure the amount of heat involved in a chemical or physical process is known as
calorimetry. Calorimetry is used to measure amounts of heat transferred to or from a substance. To do so, the heat
is exchanged with a calibrated object (calorimeter). The temperature change measured by the calorimeter is used
to derive the amount of heat transferred by the process under study. The measurement of heat transfer using this
approach requires the definition of a system (the substance or substances undergoing the chemical or physical change)
and its surroundings (all other matter, including components of the measurement apparatus, that serve to either
provide heat to the system or absorb heat from the system).
A calorimeter is a device used to measure the amount of heat involved in a chemical or physical process. For
example, when an exothermic reaction occurs in solution in a calorimeter, the heat produced by the reaction is
absorbed by the solution, which increases its temperature. When an endothermic reaction occurs, the heat required is
absorbed from the thermal energy of the solution, which decreases its temperature (Figure 5.11). The temperature
change, along with the specific heat and mass of the solution, can then be used to calculate the amount of heat
involved in either case.

Figure 5.11 In a calorimetric determination, either (a) an exothermic process occurs and heat, q, is negative,
indicating that thermal energy is transferred from the system to its surroundings, or (b) an endothermic process
occurs and heat, q, is positive, indicating that thermal energy is transferred from the surroundings to the system.
Scientists use well-insulated calorimeters that all but prevent the transfer of heat between the calorimeter and its
environment, which effectively limits the “surroundings” to the nonsystem components with the calorimeter (and
the calorimeter itself). This enables the accurate determination of the heat involved in chemical processes, the
energy content of foods, and so on. General chemistry students often use simple calorimeters constructed from
polystyrene cups (Figure 5.12). These easy-to-use “coffee cup” calorimeters allow more heat exchange with the
outside environment, and therefore produce less accurate energy values.
Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 243
Figure 5.12 A simple calorimeter can be constructed from two polystyrene cups. A thermometer and stirrer extend
through the cover into the reaction mixture.
Commercial solution calorimeters are also available. Relatively inexpensive calorimeters often consist of two thin-
walled cups that are nested in a way that minimizes thermal contact during use, along with an insulated cover,
handheld stirrer, and simple thermometer. More expensive calorimeters used for industry and research typically have a
well-insulated, fully enclosed reaction vessel, motorized stirring mechanism, and a more accurate temperature sensor
(Figure 5.13).

Figure 5.13 Commercial solution calorimeters range from (a) simple, inexpensive models for student use to (b)
expensive, more accurate models for industry and research.
Before discussing the calorimetry of chemical reactions, consider a simpler example that illustrates the core idea
behind calorimetry. Suppose we initially have a high-temperature substance, such as a hot piece of metal (M), and a
low-temperature substance, such as cool water (W). If we place the metal in the water, heat will flow from M to W.
The temperature of M will decrease, and the temperature of W will increase, until the two substances have the same
temperature—that is, when they reach thermal equilibrium (Figure 5.14). If this occurs in a calorimeter, ideally all
of this heat transfer occurs between the two substances, with no heat gained or lost by either its external environment.
Under these ideal circumstances, the net heat change is zero:
qsubstance M + qsubstance W = 0
This relationship can be rearranged to show that the heat gained by substance M is equal to the heat lost by substance
W:
qsubstance M = −qsubstance W
The magnitude of the heat (change) is therefore the same for both substances, and the negative sign merely shows
that qsubstance M and qsubstance W are opposite in direction of heat flow (gain or loss) but does not indicate the arithmetic
sign of either q value (that is determined by whether the matter in question gains or loses heat, per definition). In the
specific situation described, qsubstance M is a negative value and qsubstance W is positive, since heat is transferred from
M to W.
Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 245
Figure 5.14 In a simple calorimetry process, (a) heat, q, is transferred from the hot metal, M, to the cool water, W,
until (b) both are at the same temperature.
Example 5.3
Heat Transfer between Substances at Different Temperatures
A 360.0-g piece of rebar (a steel rod used for reinforcing concrete) is dropped into 425 mL of water at
24.0 °C. The final temperature of the water was measured as 42.7 °C. Calculate the initial temperature
of the piece of rebar. Assume the specific heat of steel is approximately the same as that for iron (Table
5.1), and that all heat transfer occurs between the rebar and the water (there is no heat exchange with the
surroundings).
Solution
The temperature of the water increases from 24.0 °C to 42.7 °C, so the water absorbs heat. That heat came
from the piece of rebar, which initially was at a higher temperature. Assuming that all heat transfer was
between the rebar and the water, with no heat “lost” to the outside environment, then heat given off by rebar
= −heat taken in by water, or:
qrebar = −qwater
Since we know how heat is related to other measurable quantities, we have:
(c × m × ΔT)rebar = −(c × m × ΔT)water
Letting f = final and i = initial, in expanded form, this becomes:
crebar × mrebar × (Tf,rebar − Ti,rebar) = −cwater × mwater × (Tf,water − Ti,water)
The density of water is 1.0 g/mL, so 425 mL of water = 425 g. Noting that the final temperature of both the
rebar and water is 42.7 °C, substituting known values yields:

Answer: The final temperature (reached by both copper and water) is 38.7 °C.
This method can also be used to determine other quantities, such as the specific heat of an unknown metal.
Example 5.4
Identifying a Metal by Measuring Specific Heat
A 59.7 g piece of metal that had been submerged in boiling water was quickly transferred into 60.0 mL of
water initially at 22.0 °C. The final temperature is 28.5 °C. Use these data to determine the specific heat of
the metal. Use this result to identify the metal.
Solution
Assuming perfect heat transfer, heat given off by metal = −heat taken in by water, or:
qmetal = −qwater
In expanded form, this is:
cmetal × mmetal × (Tf,metal − Ti, metal) = −cwater × mwater × (Tf,water − Ti,water)
Noting that since the metal was submerged in boiling water, its initial temperature was 100.0 °C; and that
for water, 60.0 mL = 60.0 g; we have:
(cmetal)(59.7 g)(28.5 °C − 100.0 °C) = −(4.18 J/g °C)(60.0 g)(28.5 °C − 22.0 °C)
Solving this:
cmetal = −(4.184 J/g °C)(60.0 g)(6.5 °C)
(59.7 g)(−71.5 °C) = 0.38 J/g °C
Comparing this with values in Table 5.1, our experimental specific heat is closest to the value for copper
(0.39 J/g °C), so we identify the metal as copper.

29.7 °C. Determine the specific heat and the identity of the metal. (Note: You should find that the specific
heat is close to that of two different metals. Explain how you can confidently determine the identity of the
metal).
Answer: cmetal= 0.13 J/g °C This specific heat is close to that of either gold or lead. It would be difficult to
Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 247
determine which metal this was based solely on the numerical values. However, the observation that the
metal is silver/gray in addition to the value for the specific heat indicates that the metal is lead.
When we use calorimetry to determine the heat involved in a chemical reaction, the same principles we have been
discussing apply. The amount of heat absorbed by the calorimeter is often small enough that we can neglect it (though
not for highly accurate measurements, as discussed later), and the calorimeter minimizes energy exchange with the
outside environment. Because energy is neither created nor destroyed during a chemical reaction, the heat produced or
consumed in the reaction (the “system”), qreaction, plus the heat absorbed or lost by the solution (the “surroundings”),
qsolution, must add up to zero:
qreaction + qsolution = 0
This means that the amount of heat produced or consumed in the reaction equals the amount of heat absorbed or lost
by the solution:
qreaction = −qsolution
This concept lies at the heart of all calorimetry problems and calculations.
Example 5.5
Heat Produced by an Exothermic Reaction
When 50.0 mL of 1.00 M HCl(aq) and 50.0 mL of 1.00 M NaOH(aq), both at 22.0 °C, are added to a coffee
cup calorimeter, the temperature of the mixture reaches a maximum of 28.9 °C. What is the approximate
amount of heat produced by this reaction?
HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) ⟶ NaCl(aq) + H2 O(l)
Solution
To visualize what is going on, imagine that you could combine the two solutions so quickly that no reaction
took place while they mixed; then after mixing, the reaction took place. At the instant of mixing, you have
100.0 mL of a mixture of HCl and NaOH at 22.0 °C. The HCl and NaOH then react until the solution
temperature reaches 28.9 °C.
The heat given off by the reaction is equal to that taken in by the solution. Therefore:
qreaction = −qsolution
(It is important to remember that this relationship only holds if the calorimeter does not absorb any heat
from the reaction, and there is no heat exchange between the calorimeter and the outside environment.)
Next, we know that the heat absorbed by the solution depends on its specific heat, mass, and temperature
change:
qsolution = (c × m × ΔT)solution
To proceed with this calculation, we need to make a few more reasonable assumptions or approximations.
Since the solution is aqueous, we can proceed as if it were water in terms of its specific heat and mass
values. The density of water is approximately 1.0 g/mL, so 100.0 mL has a mass of about 1.0 × 102 g (two
significant figures). The specific heat of water is approximately 4.184 J/g °C, so we use that for the specific
heat of the solution. Substituting these values gives:
qsolution = (4.184 J/g °C)(1.0 × 102 g)(28.9 °C − 22.0 °C) = 2.9 × 103 J
Finally, since we are trying to find the heat of the reaction, we have:

qreaction = −qsolution = −2.9 × 103 J

Thermochemistry of Hand Warmers
When working or playing outdoors on a cold day, you might use a hand warmer to warm your hands (Figure
5.15). A common reusable hand warmer contains a supersaturated solution of NaC2H3O2 (sodium acetate)
and a metal disc. Bending the disk creates nucleation sites around which the metastable NaC2H3O2 quickly
crystallizes (a later chapter on solutions will investigate saturation and supersaturation in more detail).
The process NaC2 H3 O2(aq) ⟶ NaC2 H3 O2(s) is exothermic, and the heat produced by this process is
absorbed by your hands, thereby warming them (at least for a while). If the hand warmer is reheated, the
NaC2H3O2 redissolves and can be reused.
Figure 5.15 Chemical hand warmers produce heat that warms your hand on a cold day. In this one, you can
see the metal disc that initiates the exothermic precipitation reaction. (credit: modification of work by Science

Another common hand warmer produces heat when it is ripped open, exposing iron and water in the
hand warmer to oxygen in the air. One simplified version of this exothermic reaction is
2Fe(s) + 3
2 O2(g) ⟶ Fe2 O3(s). Salt in the hand warmer catalyzes the reaction, so it produces heat more
rapidly; cellulose, vermiculite, and activated carbon help distribute the heat evenly. Other types of hand
warmers use lighter fluid (a platinum catalyst helps lighter fluid oxidize exothermically), charcoal (charcoal
oxidizes in a special case), or electrical units that produce heat by passing an electrical current from a battery
through resistive wires.

Example 5.6
Heat Flow in an Instant Ice Pack
When solid ammonium nitrate dissolves in water, the solution becomes cold. This is the basis for an “instant
ice pack” (Figure 5.16). When 3.21 g of solid NH4NO3 dissolves in 50.0 g of water at 24.9 °C in a
calorimeter, the temperature decreases to 20.3 °C.
Calculate the value of q for this reaction and explain the meaning of its arithmetic sign. State any
assumptions that you made.
Figure 5.16 An instant cold pack consists of a bag containing solid ammonium nitrate and a second bag of
water. When the bag of water is broken, the pack becomes cold because the dissolution of ammonium
nitrate is an endothermic process that removes thermal energy from the water. The cold pack then removes
thermal energy from your body.
Solution
We assume that the calorimeter prevents heat transfer between the solution and its external environment
(including the calorimeter itself), in which case:

If the amount of heat absorbed by a calorimeter is too large to neglect or if we require more accurate results, then we
must take into account the heat absorbed both by the solution and by the calorimeter.
The calorimeters described are designed to operate at constant (atmospheric) pressure and are convenient to measure
heat flow accompanying processes that occur in solution. A different type of calorimeter that operates at constant
volume, colloquially known as a bomb calorimeter, is used to measure the energy produced by reactions that
yield large amounts of heat and gaseous products, such as combustion reactions. (The term “bomb” comes from
the observation that these reactions can be vigorous enough to resemble explosions that would damage other
calorimeters.) This type of calorimeter consists of a robust steel container (the “bomb”) that contains the reactants and
is itself submerged in water (Figure 5.17). The sample is placed in the bomb, which is then filled with oxygen at high
pressure. A small electrical spark is used to ignite the sample. The energy produced by the reaction is absorbed by the
steel bomb and the surrounding water. The temperature increase is measured and, along with the known heat capacity
of the calorimeter, is used to calculate the energy produced by the reaction. Bomb calorimeters require calibration to
determine the heat capacity of the calorimeter and ensure accurate results. The calibration is accomplished using a
reaction with a known q, such as a measured quantity of benzoic acid ignited by a spark from a nickel fuse wire that is
weighed before and after the reaction. The temperature change produced by the known reaction is used to determine
the heat capacity of the calorimeter. The calibration is generally performed each time before the calorimeter is used
to gather research data.

Solution
The combustion produces heat that is primarily absorbed by the water and the bomb. (The amounts of heat
absorbed by the reaction products and the unreacted excess oxygen are relatively small and dealing with
them is beyond the scope of this text. We will neglect them in our calculations.)

Since the first one was constructed in 1899, 35 calorimeters have been built to measure the heat produced by a living
person.[2] These whole-body calorimeters of various designs are large enough to hold an individual human being.
More recently, whole-room calorimeters allow for relatively normal activities to be performed, and these calorimeters
generate data that more closely reflect the real world. These calorimeters are used to measure the metabolism of
individuals under different environmental conditions, different dietary regimes, and with different health conditions,
such as diabetes. In humans, metabolism is typically measured in Calories per day. A nutritional calorie (Calorie) is
the energy unit used to quantify the amount of energy derived from the metabolism of foods; one Calorie is equal to
1000 calories (1 kcal), the amount of energy needed to heat 1 kg of water by 1 °C.
Measuring Nutritional Calories
In your day-to-day life, you may be more familiar with energy being given in Calories, or nutritional calories,
which are used to quantify the amount of energy in foods. One calorie (cal) = exactly 4.184 joules, and one
Calorie (note the capitalization) = 1000 cal, or 1 kcal. (This is approximately the amount of energy needed to
heat 1 kg of water by 1 °C.)
The macronutrients in food are proteins, carbohydrates, and fats or oils. Proteins provide about 4 Calories
per gram, carbohydrates also provide about 4 Calories per gram, and fats and oils provide about 9 Calories/
g. Nutritional labels on food packages show the caloric content of one serving of the food, as well as the
breakdown into Calories from each of the three macronutrients (Figure 5.18).

food’s nutritional information is shown on the package label. In the US, the energy content is given in Calories
(per serving); the rest of the world usually uses kilojoules. (credit a: modification of work by “Rex Roof”/Flickr)
For the example shown in (b), the total energy per 228-g portion is calculated by:
(5 g protein × 4 Calories/g) + (31 g carb × 4 Calories/g) + (12 g fat × 9 Calories/g) = 252 Calories
So, you can use food labels to count your Calories. But where do the values come from? And how accurate
are they? The caloric content of foods can be determined by using bomb calorimetry; that is, by burning the
food and measuring the energy it contains. A sample of food is weighed, mixed in a blender, freeze-dried,
ground into powder, and formed into a pellet. The pellet is burned inside a bomb calorimeter, and the measured
temperature change is converted into energy per gram of food.
Today, the caloric content on food labels is derived using a method called the Atwater system that uses the
average caloric content of the different chemical constituents of food, protein, carbohydrate, and fats. The
average amounts are those given in the equation and are derived from the various results given by bomb
calorimetry of whole foods. The carbohydrate amount is discounted a certain amount for the fiber content,
which is indigestible carbohydrate. To determine the energy content of a food, the quantities of carbohydrate,
protein, and fat are each multiplied by the average Calories per gram for each and the products summed to
obtain the total energy.

Thermochemistry is a branch of chemical thermodynamics, the science that deals with the relationships between
heat, work, and other forms of energy in the context of chemical and physical processes. As we concentrate on
thermochemistry in this chapter, we need to consider some widely used concepts of thermodynamics.
Substances act as reservoirs of energy, meaning that energy can be added to them or removed from them. Energy is
stored in a substance when the kinetic energy of its atoms or molecules is raised. The greater kinetic energy may be in
the form of increased translations (travel or straight-line motions), vibrations, or rotations of the atoms or molecules.
When thermal energy is lost, the intensities of these motions decrease and the kinetic energy falls. The total of all
possible kinds of energy present in a substance is called the internal energy (U), sometimes symbolized as E.
As a system undergoes a change, its internal energy can change, and energy can be transferred from the system to the
surroundings, or from the surroundings to the system. Energy is transferred into a system when it absorbs heat (q)
from the surroundings or when the surroundings do work (w) on the system. For example, energy is transferred into
room-temperature metal wire if it is immersed in hot water (the wire absorbs heat from the water), or if you rapidly
bend the wire back and forth (the wire becomes warmer because of the work done on it). Both processes increase
the internal energy of the wire, which is reflected in an increase in the wire’s temperature. Conversely, energy is
transferred out of a system when heat is lost from the system, or when the system does work on the surroundings.
The relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented by the equation:
ΔU = q + w
as shown in Figure 5.19. This is one version of the first law of thermodynamics, and it shows that the internal
energy of a system changes through heat flow into or out of the system (positive q is heat flow in; negative q is heat
flow out) or work done on or by the system. The work, w, is positive if it is done on the system and negative if it is
done by the system.
Figure 5.19 The internal energy, U, of a system can be changed by heat flow and work. If heat flows into the
system, qin, or work is done on the system, won, its internal energy increases, ΔU > 0. If heat flows out of the system,
qout, or work is done by the system, wby, its internal energy decreases, ΔU < 0.
Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 255
A type of work called expansion work (or pressure-volume work) occurs when a system pushes back the
surroundings against a restraining pressure, or when the surroundings compress the system. An example of this occurs
during the operation of an internal combustion engine. The reaction of gasoline and oxygen is exothermic. Some of
this energy is given off as heat, and some does work pushing the piston in the cylinder. The substances involved in
the reaction are the system, and the engine and the rest of the universe are the surroundings. The system loses energy
by both heating and doing work on the surroundings, and its internal energy decreases. (The engine is able to keep
the car moving because this process is repeated many times per second while the engine is running.) We will consider
how to determine the amount of work involved in a chemical or physical change in the chapter on thermodynamics.
This view of an internal combustion engine (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16combustion) illustrates
the conversion of energy produced by the exothermic combustion reaction of a fuel such as gasoline into
energy of motion.
As discussed, the relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented as ΔU = q + w. Internal
energy is an example of a state function (or state variable), whereas heat and work are not state functions. The value
of a state function depends only on the state that a system is in, and not on how that state is reached. If a quantity is
not a state function, then its value does depend on how the state is reached. An example of a state function is altitude
or elevation. If you stand on the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro, you are at an altitude of 5895 m, and it does not matter
whether you hiked there or parachuted there. The distance you traveled to the top of Kilimanjaro, however, is not a
state function. You could climb to the summit by a direct route or by a more roundabout, circuitous path (Figure
5.20). The distances traveled would differ (distance is not a state function) but the elevation reached would be the
same (altitude is a state function).
Figure 5.20 Paths X and Y represent two different routes to the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Both have the same
change in elevation (altitude or elevation on a mountain is a state function; it does not depend on path), but they have
very different distances traveled (distance walked is not a state function; it depends on the path). (credit: modification

Chemists ordinarily use a property known as enthalpy (H) to describe the thermodynamics of chemical and physical
processes. Enthalpy is defined as the sum of a system’s internal energy (U) and the mathematical product of its

pressure (P) and volume (V):
H = U + PV
Enthalpy is also a state function. Enthalpy values for specific substances cannot be measured directly; only enthalpy
changes for chemical or physical processes can be determined. For processes that take place at constant pressure (a
common condition for many chemical and physical changes), the enthalpy change (ΔH) is:
ΔH = ΔU + PΔV
The mathematical product PΔV represents work (w), namely, expansion or pressure-volume work as noted. By their
definitions, the arithmetic signs of ΔV and w will always be opposite:
PΔV = −w
Substituting this equation and the definition of internal energy into the enthalpy-change equation yields:
ΔH = ΔU + PΔV
= qp + w − w
= qp
where qp is the heat of reaction under conditions of constant pressure.
And so, if a chemical or physical process is carried out at constant pressure with the only work done caused by
expansion or contraction, then the heat flow (qp) and enthalpy change (ΔH) for the process are equal.
The heat given off when you operate a Bunsen burner is equal to the enthalpy change of the methane combustion
reaction that takes place, since it occurs at the essentially constant pressure of the atmosphere. On the other hand, the
heat produced by a reaction measured in a bomb calorimeter (Figure 5.17) is not equal to ΔH because the closed,
constant-volume metal container prevents the pressure from remaining constant (it may increase or decrease if the
reaction yields increased or decreased amounts of gaseous species). Chemists usually perform experiments under
normal atmospheric conditions, at constant external pressure with q = ΔH, which makes enthalpy the most convenient
choice for determining heat changes for chemical reactions.
The following conventions apply when using ΔH:
• A negative value of an enthalpy change, ΔH < 0, indicates an exothermic reaction; a positive value, ΔH > 0,
indicates an endothermic reaction. If the direction of a chemical equation is reversed, the arithmetic sign of its
ΔH is changed (a process that is endothermic in one direction is exothermic in the opposite direction).
• Chemists use a thermochemical equation to represent the changes in both matter and energy. In a
thermochemical equation, the enthalpy change of a reaction is shown as a ΔH value following the equation for
the reaction. This ΔH value indicates the amount of heat associated with the reaction involving the number of
moles of reactants and products as shown in the chemical equation. For example, consider this equation:
H2(g) + 1
2O2(g) ⟶ H2 O(l) ΔH = −286 kJ
This equation indicates that when 1 mole of hydrogen gas and 1
2 mole of oxygen gas at some temperature and
pressure change to 1 mole of liquid water at the same temperature and pressure, 286 kJ of heat are released
to the surroundings. If the coefficients of the chemical equation are multiplied by some factor, the enthalpy
change must be multiplied by that same factor (ΔH is an extensive property):
(two-fold increase in amounts)
2H2(g) + O2(g) ⟶ 2H2 O(l) ΔH = 2 × (−286 kJ) = −572 kJ
(two-fold decrease in amounts)
1
2H2(g) + 1
4O2(g) ⟶ 1
2H2 O(l) ΔH = 1
2 × (−286 kJ) = −143 kJ
• The enthalpy change of a reaction depends on the physical states of the reactants and products, so these must
be shown. For example, when 1 mole of hydrogen gas and 1
2 mole of oxygen gas change to 1 mole of liquid

water at the same temperature and pressure, 286 kJ of heat are released. If gaseous water forms, only 242 kJ
of heat are released.

Solution
For the reaction of 0.0500 mol acid (HCl), q = −2.9 kJ. The reactants are provided in stoichiometric amounts
(same molar ratio as in the balanced equation), and so the amount of acid may be used to calculate a molar
enthalpy change. Since ΔH is an extensive property, it is proportional to the amount of acid neutralized:
ΔH = 1 mol HCl × −2.9 kJ
0.0500 mol HCl = −58 kJ
The thermochemical equation is then
HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) ⟶ NaCl(aq) + H2 O(l) ΔH = −58 kJ

The balanced equation indicates 8 mol KClO3 are required for reaction with 1 mol C12H22O11. Since the
provided amount of KClO3 is less than the stoichiometric amount, it is the limiting reactant and may be used
to compute the enthalpy change:
△ H = - 43.7 kJ/0.0587 mol KCIO3 = 744 kJ/mol KCIO3

⎛

The enthalpy change for this reaction is −5960 kJ, and the thermochemical equation is:

Answer: ΔH = −338 kJ
Enthalpy changes are typically tabulated for reactions in which both the reactants and products are at the same
conditions. A standard state is a commonly accepted set of conditions used as a reference point for the determination
of properties under other different conditions. For chemists, the IUPAC standard state refers to materials under a
pressure of 1 bar and solutions at 1 M, and does not specify a temperature. Many thermochemical tables list values
with a standard state of 1 atm. Because the ΔH of a reaction changes very little with such small changes in pressure
(1 bar = 0.987 atm), ΔH values (except for the most precisely measured values) are essentially the same under both
sets of standard conditions. We will include a superscripted “o” in the enthalpy change symbol to designate standard
state. Since the usual (but not technically standard) temperature is 298.15 K, this temperature will be assumed unless
some other temperature is specified. Thus, the symbol (ΔH°) is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a process
occurring under these conditions. (The symbol ΔH is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a reaction occurring
under nonstandard conditions.)
The enthalpy changes for many types of chemical and physical processes are available in the reference literature,
including those for combustion reactions, phase transitions, and formation reactions. As we discuss these quantities,
it is important to pay attention to the extensive nature of enthalpy and enthalpy changes. Since the enthalpy change
for a given reaction is proportional to the amounts of substances involved, it may be reported on that basis (i.e., as the
ΔH for specific amounts of reactants). However, we often find it more useful to divide one extensive property (ΔH)
by another (amount of substance), and report a per-amount intensive value of ΔH, often “normalized” to a per-mole
basis. (Note that this is similar to determining the intensive property specific heat from the extensive property heat
capacity, as seen previously.)
Standard Enthalpy of Combustion
Standard enthalpy of combustion (ΔHC
° ) is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a substance burns (combines
vigorously with oxygen) under standard state conditions; it is sometimes called “heat of combustion.” For example,
the enthalpy of combustion of ethanol, −1366.8 kJ/mol, is the amount of heat produced when one mole of ethanol
undergoes complete combustion at 25 °C and 1 atmosphere pressure, yielding products also at 25 °C and 1 atm.
C2 H5 OH(l) + 3O2(g) ⟶ 2CO2 + 3H2 O(l) ΔH° = −1366.8 kJ
Enthalpies of combustion for many substances have been measured; a few of these are listed in Table 5.2. Many
readily available substances with large enthalpies of combustion are used as fuels, including hydrogen, carbon (as
coal or charcoal), and hydrocarbons (compounds containing only hydrogen and carbon), such as methane, propane,
and the major components of gasoline.

0.692 g/mL.

Solution
Starting with a known amount (1.00 L of isooctane), we can perform conversions between units until we
arrive at the desired amount of heat or energy. The enthalpy of combustion of isooctane provides one of the
necessary conversions. Table 5.2 gives this value as −5460 kJ per 1 mole of isooctane (C8H18).
Using these data,

The combustion of 1.00 L of isooctane produces 33,100 kJ of heat. (This amount of energy is enough to
melt 99.2 kg, or about 218 lbs, of ice.)
Note: If you do this calculation one step at a time, you would find:

Emerging Algae-Based Energy Technologies (Biofuels)
As reserves of fossil fuels diminish and become more costly to extract, the search is ongoing for replacement
fuel sources for the future. Among the most promising biofuels are those derived from algae (Figure 5.22).
The species of algae used are nontoxic, biodegradable, and among the world’s fastest growing organisms.
About 50% of algal weight is oil, which can be readily converted into fuel such as biodiesel. Algae can yield
26,000 gallons of biofuel per hectare—much more energy per acre than other crops. Some strains of algae can
flourish in brackish water that is not usable for growing other crops. Algae can produce biodiesel, biogasoline,
ethanol, butanol, methane, and even jet fuel.

According to the US Department of Energy, only 39,000 square kilometers (about 0.4% of the land mass of the
US or less than 1
7 of the area used to grow corn) can produce enough algal fuel to replace all the petroleum-
based fuel used in the US. The cost of algal fuels is becoming more competitive—for instance, the US Air
Force is producing jet fuel from algae at a total cost of under $5 per gallon.[3] The process used to produce
algal fuel is as follows: grow the algae (which use sunlight as their energy source and CO2 as a raw material);
harvest the algae; extract the fuel compounds (or precursor compounds); process as necessary (e.g., perform
a transesterification reaction to make biodiesel); purify; and distribute (Figure 5.23).

Standard Enthalpy of Formation
A standard enthalpy of formation is an enthalpy change for a reaction in which exactly 1 mole of a pure substance
is formed from free elements in their most stable states under standard state conditions. These values are especially
useful for computing or predicting enthalpy changes for chemical reactions that are impractical or dangerous to carry
out, or for processes for which it is difficult to make measurements. If we have values for the appropriate standard
enthalpies of formation, we can determine the enthalpy change for any reaction, which we will practice in the next
section on Hess’s law.
The standard enthalpy of formation of CO2(g) is −393.5 kJ/mol. This is the enthalpy change for the exothermic
reaction:
C(s) + O2(g) ⟶ CO2(g) ΔHf° = ΔH° = −393.5 kJ
starting with the reactants at a pressure of 1 atm and 25 °C (with the carbon present as graphite, the most stable form
of carbon under these conditions) and ending with one mole of CO2, also at 1 atm and 25 °C. For nitrogen dioxide,
NO2(g), ΔHf° is 33.2 kJ/mol. This is the enthalpy change for the reaction:
1
2N2(g) + O2(g) ⟶ NO2(g) ΔHf° = ΔH° = +33.2 kJ
A reaction equation with 1
2 mole of N2 and 1 mole of O2 is correct in this case because the standard enthalpy of
formation always refers to 1 mole of product, NO2(g).
You will find a table of standard enthalpies of formation of many common substances in Appendix G. These values
indicate that formation reactions range from highly exothermic (such as −2984 kJ/mol for the formation of P4O10)
to strongly endothermic (such as +226.7 kJ/mol for the formation of acetylene, C2H2). By definition, the standard
enthalpy of formation of an element in its most stable form is equal to zero under standard conditions, which is 1 atm
for gases and 1 M for solutions.
Example 5.11
Evaluating an Enthalpy of Formation
Ozone, O3(g), forms from oxygen, O2(g), by an endothermic process. Ultraviolet radiation is the source of
the energy that drives this reaction in the upper atmosphere. Assuming that both the reactants and products
of the reaction are in their standard states, determine the standard enthalpy of formation, ΔHf° of ozone
from the following information:
3O2(g) ⟶ 2O3(g) ΔH° = +286 kJ
Solution
ΔHf° is the enthalpy change for the formation of one mole of a substance in its standard state from the
elements in their standard states. Thus, ΔHf° for O3(g) is the enthalpy change for the reaction:
3
2O2(g) ⟶ O3(g)
For the formation of 2 mol of O3(g), ΔH° = +286 kJ. This ratio, ⎛
⎝ 286 kJ
2 mol O3
⎞
⎠, can be used as a conversion
factor to find the heat produced when 1 mole of O3(g) is formed, which is the enthalpy of formation for
O3(g):
ΔH° for 1 mole of O3(g) = 1 mol O3 × 286 kJ
2 mol O3
= 143 kJ
Therefore, ΔHf° [O3(g)] = +143 kJ/mol.

Hess’s Law
There are two ways to determine the amount of heat involved in a chemical change: measure it experimentally, or
calculate it from other experimentally determined enthalpy changes. Some reactions are difficult, if not impossible,
to investigate and make accurate measurements for experimentally. And even when a reaction is not hard to perform
or measure, it is convenient to be able to determine the heat involved in a reaction without having to perform an
experiment.
This type of calculation usually involves the use of Hess’s law, which states: If a process can be written as the sum
of several stepwise processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of
the various steps. Hess’s law is valid because enthalpy is a state function: Enthalpy changes depend only on where
a chemical process starts and ends, but not on the path it takes from start to finish. For example, we can think of
the reaction of carbon with oxygen to form carbon dioxide as occurring either directly or by a two-step process. The
direct process is written:
C(s) + O2(g) ⟶ CO2(g) ΔH° = −394 kJ
In the two-step process, first carbon monoxide is formed:
264 Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
C(s) + 1
2O2(g) ⟶ CO(g) ΔH° = −111 kJ
Then, carbon monoxide reacts further to form carbon dioxide:
CO(g) + 1
2O2(g) ⟶ CO2(g) ΔH° = −283 kJ
The equation describing the overall reaction is the sum of these two chemical changes:
Step 1: C(s) + 1
2O2(g) ⟶ CO(g)
Step 2: CO(g) + 1
2O2(g) ⟶ CO2(g)
Sum: C(s) + 1
2O2(g) + CO(g) + 1
2O2(g) ⟶ CO(g) + CO2(g)
Because the CO produced in Step 1 is consumed in Step 2, the net change is:
C(s) + O2(g) ⟶ CO2(g)
According to Hess’s law, the enthalpy change of the reaction will equal the sum of the enthalpy changes of the steps.
C(s) + 1
2O2(g) ⟶ CO(g) ΔH° = −111 kJ
CO(g) + 1
2O2(g) ⟶ CO2(g)
C(s) + O2(g) ⟶ CO2(g) ΔH° = −283 kJ
ΔH° = −394 kJ
The result is shown in Figure 5.24. We see that ΔH of the overall reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step
or two. This finding (overall ΔH for the reaction = sum of ΔH values for reaction “steps” in the overall reaction) is
true in general for chemical and physical processes.
Figure 5.24 The formation of CO2(g) from its elements can be thought of as occurring in two steps, which sum to the
overall reaction, as described by Hess’s law. The horizontal blue lines represent enthalpies. For an exothermic
process, the products are at lower enthalpy than are the reactants.
Before we further practice using Hess’s law, let us recall two important features of ΔH.
1. ΔH is directly proportional to the quantities of reactants or products. For example, the enthalpy change for the
reaction forming 1 mole of NO2(g) is +33.2 kJ:
1
2N2(g) + O2(g) ⟶ NO2(g) ΔH = +33.2 kJ
When 2 moles of NO2 (twice as much) are formed, the ΔH will be twice as large:
Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 265
N2(g) + 2O2(g) ⟶ 2NO2(g) ΔH = +66.4 kJ
In general, if we multiply or divide an equation by a number, then the enthalpy change should also be
multiplied or divided by the same number.
2. ΔH for a reaction in one direction is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to ΔH for the reaction in the
reverse direction. For example, given that:
H2(g) + Cl2(g) ⟶ 2HCl(g) ΔH = −184.6 kJ
Then, for the “reverse” reaction, the enthalpy change is also “reversed”:
2HCl(g) ⟶ H2(g) + Cl2(g) ΔH = +184.6 kJ
Example 5.13
Stepwise Calculation of ΔHf° Using Hess’s Law
Determine the enthalpy of formation, ΔHf° , of FeCl3(s) from the enthalpy changes of the following two-
step process that occurs under standard state conditions:
Fe(s) + Cl2(g) ⟶ FeCl2(s) ΔH° = −341.8 kJ
FeCl2(s) + 1
2Cl2(g) ⟶ FeCl3(s) ΔH° = −57.7 kJ
Solution
We are trying to find the standard enthalpy of formation of FeCl3(s), which is equal to ΔH° for the reaction:
Fe(s) + 3
2Cl2(g) ⟶ FeCl3(s) ΔHf° = ?
Looking at the reactions, we see that the reaction for which we want to find ΔH° is the sum of the two
reactions with known ΔH values, so we must sum their ΔHs:
Fe(s) + Cl2(g) ⟶ FeCl2(s) ΔH° = −341.8 kJ
FeCl2(s) + 1
2Cl2(g) ⟶ FeCl3(s)
Fe(s) + 1
2Cl2(g) ⟶ FeCl3(s)
ΔH° = −57.7 kJ
ΔH° = −399.5 kJ
The enthalpy of formation, ΔHf° , of FeCl3(s) is −399.5 kJ/mol.

(iv) ClF3(g) + O2(g) ⟶ 1
2Cl2 O(g) + 3
2OF2(g) ΔH(iv)° = +266.7 kJ
Solution
Our goal is to manipulate and combine reactions (ii), (iii), and (iv) such that they add up to reaction (i).
Going from left to right in (i), we first see that ClF(g) is needed as a reactant. This can be obtained by
multiplying reaction (iii) by 1
2, which means that the ΔH° change is also multiplied by 1
2:
ClF(g) + 1
2O2(g) ⟶ 1
2Cl2 O(g) + 1
2OF2(g) ΔH° = 1
2(205.6) = +102.8 kJ
Next, we see that F2 is also needed as a reactant. To get this, reverse and halve reaction (ii), which means
that the ΔH° changes sign and is halved:
1
2O2(g) + F2(g) ⟶ OF2(g) ΔH° = +24.7 kJ
To get ClF3 as a product, reverse (iv), changing the sign of ΔH°:
1
2Cl2 O(g) + 3
2OF2(g) ⟶ ClF3(g) + O2(g) ΔH° = −266.7 kJ
Now check to make sure that these reactions add up to the reaction we want:
ClF(g) + 1
2O2(g) ⟶ 1
2Cl2 O(g) + 1
2OF2(g) ΔH° = +102.8 kJ
1
2O2(g) + F2(g) ⟶ OF2(g) ΔH° = +24.7 kJ
1
2Cl2 O(g) + 3
2OF2(g) ⟶ ClF3(g) + O2(g)
ClF(g) + F2 ⟶ ClF3(g) ΔH° = −266.7 kJ
ΔH° = −139.2 kJ
Reactants 1
2O2 and 1
2O2 cancel out product O2; product 1
2Cl2 O cancels reactant 1
2Cl2 O; and reactant
3
2OF2 is cancelled by products 1
2OF2 and OF2. This leaves only reactants ClF(g) and F2(g) and product
ClF3(g), which are what we want. Since summing these three modified reactions yields the reaction of
interest, summing the three modified ΔH° values will give the desired ΔH°:
ΔH° = (+102.8 kJ) + (24.7 kJ) + (−266.7 kJ) = −139.2 kJ

Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 267
We also can use Hess’s law to determine the enthalpy change of any reaction if the corresponding enthalpies of
formation of the reactants and products are available. The stepwise reactions we consider are: (i) decompositions of
the reactants into their component elements (for which the enthalpy changes are proportional to the negative of the
enthalpies of formation of the reactants), followed by (ii) re-combinations of the elements to give the products (with
the enthalpy changes proportional to the enthalpies of formation of the products). The standard enthalpy change of
the overall reaction is therefore equal to: (ii) the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of all the products plus
(i) the sum of the negatives of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants. This is usually rearranged slightly
to be written as follows, with ∑ representing “the sum of” and n standing for the stoichiometric coefficients:
ΔHreaction° = ∑ n × ΔHf° (products) − ∑ n × ΔHf° (reactants)
The following example shows in detail why this equation is valid, and how to use it to calculate the enthalpy change
for a reaction of interest.
Example 5.15
Using Hess’s Law
What is the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:
3NO2(g) + H2 O(l) ⟶ 2HNO3(aq) + NO(g) ΔH° = ?
Solution: Using the Equation
Use the special form of Hess’s law given previously, and values from Appendix G:
ΔHreaction° = ∑ n × ΔHf° (products) − ∑ n × ΔHf° (reactants)
= ⎡
⎣
⎢2 mol HNO3(aq) × −207.4 kJ
mol HNO3(aq) + 1 mol NO(g) × +90.2 kJ
mol NO(g)
⎤
⎦
⎥
−⎡
⎣
⎢3 mol NO2(g) × +33.2 kJ
mol NO2(g) + 1 mol H2 O(l) × −285.8 kJ
mol H2 O(l)
⎤
⎦
⎥
= 2(−207.4 kJ) + 1(+90.2 kJ) − 3(+33.2 kJ) − 1(−285.8 kJ)
= −138.4 kJ
Solution: Supporting Why the General Equation Is Valid
Alternatively, we can write this reaction as the sum of the decompositions of 3NO2(g) and 1H2O(l) into
their constituent elements, and the formation of 2HNO3(aq) and 1NO(g) from their constituent elements.
Writing out these reactions, and noting their relationships to the ΔHf° values for these compounds (from
Appendix G ), we have:
3NO2(g) ⟶ 3/2N2(g) + 3O2(g) ΔH1° = −99.6 kJ
H2 O(l) ⟶ H2(g) + 1
2O2(g) ΔH2° = +285.8 kJ [−1 × ΔHf° (H2 O)]
H2(g) + N2(g) + 3O2(g) ⟶ 2HNO3(aq) ΔH3° = −414.8 kJ [2 × ΔHf° (HNO3)]
1
2N2(g) + 1
2O2(g) ⟶ NO(g) ΔH4° = +90.2 kJ [1 × (NO)]
Summing these reaction equations gives the reaction we are interested in:
3NO2(g) + H2 O(l) ⟶ 2HNO3(aq) + NO(g)
Summing their enthalpy changes gives the value we want to determine:
268 Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
ΔHrxn° = ΔH1° + ΔH2° + ΔH3° + ΔH4° = (−99.6 kJ) + (+285.8 kJ) + (−414.8 kJ) + (+90.2 kJ)
= −138.4 kJ
So the standard enthalpy change for this reaction is ΔH° = −138.4 kJ.
Note that this result was obtained by (1) multiplying the ΔHf° of each product by its stoichiometric
coefficient and summing those values, (2) multiplying the ΔHf° of each reactant by its stoichiometric
coefficient and summing those values, and then (3) subtracting the result found in (2) from the result found
in (1). This is also the procedure in using the general equation, as shown.

Summary
5.1 Energy Basics
Energy is the capacity to supply heat or do work (applying a force to move matter). Kinetic energy (KE) is the energy
of motion; potential energy is energy due to relative position, composition, or condition. When energy is converted
from one form into another, energy is neither created nor destroyed (law of conservation of energy or first law of
thermodynamics).
The thermal energy of matter is due to the kinetic energies of its constituent atoms or molecules. Temperature is
an intensive property of matter reflecting hotness or coldness that increases as the average kinetic energy increases.
Heat is the transfer of thermal energy between objects at different temperatures. Chemical and physical processes can
absorb heat (endothermic) or release heat (exothermic). The SI unit of energy, heat, and work is the joule (J).
Specific heat and heat capacity are measures of the energy needed to change the temperature of a substance or object.
The amount of heat absorbed or released by a substance depends directly on the type of substance, its mass, and the
temperature change it undergoes.
5.2 Calorimetry
Calorimetry is used to measure the amount of thermal energy transferred in a chemical or physical process. This
requires careful measurement of the temperature change that occurs during the process and the masses of the system
and surroundings. These measured quantities are then used to compute the amount of heat produced or consumed in
the process using known mathematical relations.
Chapter 5 | Thermochemistry 271
Calorimeters are designed to minimize energy exchange between their contents and the external environment.
They range from simple coffee cup calorimeters used by introductory chemistry students to sophisticated bomb
calorimeters used to determine the energy content of food.
5.3 Enthalpy
If a chemical change is carried out at constant pressure and the only work done is caused by expansion or contraction,
q for the change is called the enthalpy change with the symbol ΔH, or ΔH° for reactions occurring under standard
state conditions at 298 K. The value of ΔH for a reaction in one direction is equal in magnitude, but opposite in
sign, to ΔH for the reaction in the opposite direction, and ΔH is directly proportional to the quantity of reactants and
products. The standard enthalpy of formation, ΔHf° , is the enthalpy change accompanying the formation of 1 mole
of a substance from the elements in their most stable states at 1 bar and 298.15 K. If the enthalpies of formation are
available for the reactants and products of a reaction, the enthalpy change can be calculated using Hess’s law: If a
process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the
sum of the enthalpy changes of the various steps.

Introduction
In 1054, Chinese astronomers recorded the appearance of a “guest star” in the sky, visible even during the day, which
then disappeared slowly over the next two years. The sudden appearance was due to a supernova explosion, which
was much brighter than the original star. Even though this supernova was observed almost a millennium ago, the
remaining Crab Nebula (Figure 6.1) continues to release energy today. It emits not only visible light but also infrared
light, X-rays, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The nebula emits both continuous spectra (the blue-white
glow) and atomic emission spectra (the colored filaments). In this chapter, we will discuss light and other forms of
electromagnetic radiation and how they are related to the electronic structure of atoms. We will also see how this
radiation can be used to identify elements, even from thousands of light years away.

6.1 Electromagnetic Energy
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the basic behavior of waves, including travelling waves and standing waves
• Describe the wave nature of light
• Use appropriate equations to calculate related light-wave properties such as frequency, wavelength, and
energy
• Distinguish between line and continuous emission spectra
• Describe the particle nature of light
The nature of light has been a subject of inquiry since antiquity. In the seventeenth century, Isaac Newton performed
experiments with lenses and prisms and was able to demonstrate that white light consists of the individual colors
of the rainbow combined together. Newton explained his optics findings in terms of a "corpuscular" view of light,
in which light was composed of streams of extremely tiny particles travelling at high speeds according to Newton's
laws of motion. Others in the seventeenth century, such as Christiaan Huygens, had shown that optical phenomena
such as reflection and refraction could be equally well explained in terms of light as waves travelling at high speed
through a medium called "luminiferous aether" that was thought to permeate all space. Early in the nineteenth
century, Thomas Young demonstrated that light passing through narrow, closely spaced slits produced interference
patterns that could not be explained in terms of Newtonian particles but could be easily explained in terms of waves.
Later in the nineteenth century, after James Clerk Maxwell developed his theory of electromagnetic radiation and
showed that light was the visible part of a vast spectrum of electromagnetic waves, the particle view of light became
thoroughly discredited. By the end of the nineteenth century, scientists viewed the physical universe as roughly
comprising two separate domains: matter composed of particles moving according to Newton's laws of motion, and
electromagnetic radiation consisting of waves governed by Maxwell's equations. Today, these domains are referred
to as classical mechanics and classical electrodynamics (or classical electromagnetism). Although there were a few
physical phenomena that could not be explained within this framework, scientists at that time were so confident of the
overall soundness of this framework that they viewed these aberrations as puzzling paradoxes that would ultimately
be resolved somehow within this framework. As we shall see, these paradoxes led to a contemporary framework that
intimately connects particles and waves at a fundamental level called wave-particle duality, which has superseded the
classical view.
Visible light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation play important roles in chemistry, since they can be used to
infer the energies of electrons within atoms and molecules. Much of modern technology is based on electromagnetic
radiation. For example, radio waves from a mobile phone, X-rays used by dentists, the energy used to cook food
in your microwave, the radiant heat from red-hot objects, and the light from your television screen are forms of
electromagnetic radiation that all exhibit wavelike behavior.
Waves
A wave is an oscillation or periodic movement that can transport energy from one point in space to another. Common
examples of waves are all around us. Shaking the end of a rope transfers energy from your hand to the other end of
the rope, dropping a pebble into a pond causes waves to ripple outward along the water's surface, and the expansion
of air that accompanies a lightning strike generates sound waves (thunder) that can travel outward for several miles.
In each of these cases, kinetic energy is transferred through matter (the rope, water, or air) while the matter remains
essentially in place. An insightful example of a wave occurs in sports stadiums when fans in a narrow region of seats
rise simultaneously and stand with their arms raised up for a few seconds before sitting down again while the fans
in neighboring sections likewise stand up and sit down in sequence. While this wave can quickly encircle a large
stadium in a few seconds, none of the fans actually travel with the wave-they all stay in or above their seats.
Waves need not be restricted to travel through matter. As Maxwell showed, electromagnetic waves consist of an
282 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements

electric field oscillating in step with a perpendicular magnetic field, both of which are perpendicular to the direction of
travel. These waves can travel through a vacuum at a constant speed of 2.998 × 108 m/s, the speed of light (denoted
by c).
All waves, including forms of electromagnetic radiation, are characterized by, a wavelength (denoted by λ, the
lowercase Greek letter lambda), a frequency (denoted by ν, the lowercase Greek letter nu), and an amplitude. As can
be seen in Figure 6.2, the wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs in a wave (measured
in meters in the SI system). Electromagnetic waves have wavelengths that fall within an enormous range-wavelengths
of kilometers (103 m) to picometers (10−12 m) have been observed. The frequency is the number of wave cycles that
pass a specified point in space in a specified amount of time (in the SI system, this is measured in seconds). A cycle
corresponds to one complete wavelength. The unit for frequency, expressed as cycles per second [s−1], is the hertz
(Hz). Common multiples of this unit are megahertz, (1 MHz = 1 × 106 Hz) and gigahertz (1 GHz = 1 × 109 Hz).
The amplitude corresponds to the magnitude of the wave's displacement and so, in Figure 6.2, this corresponds to
one-half the height between the peaks and troughs. The amplitude is related to the intensity of the wave, which for
light is the brightness, and for sound is the loudness.
Figure 6.2 One-dimensional sinusoidal waves show the relationship among wavelength, frequency, and speed. The
wave with the shortest wavelength has the highest frequency. Amplitude is one-half the height of the wave from peak
to trough.
The product of a wave's wavelength (λ) and its frequency (ν), λν, is the speed of the wave. Thus, for electromagnetic
radiation in a vacuum, speed is equal to the fundamental constant, c:
c = 2.998 × 108 ms−1 = λν
Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional: As the wavelength increases, the frequency decreases. The
inverse proportionality is illustrated in Figure 6.3. This figure also shows the electromagnetic spectrum, the
range of all types of electromagnetic radiation. Each of the various colors of visible light has specific frequencies
and wavelengths associated with them, and you can see that visible light makes up only a small portion of the
electromagnetic spectrum. Because the technologies developed to work in various parts of the electromagnetic
spectrum are different, for reasons of convenience and historical legacies, different units are typically used for
different parts of the spectrum. For example, radio waves are usually specified as frequencies (typically in units of
MHz), while the visible region is usually specified in wavelengths (typically in units of nm or angstroms).

We can rearrange the equation c = λν to solve for the frequency:

Many valuable technologies operate in the radio (3 kHz-300 GHz) frequency region of the electromagnetic
spectrum. At the low frequency (low energy, long wavelength) end of this region are AM (amplitude modulation)
radio signals (540-2830 kHz) that can travel long distances. FM (frequency modulation) radio signals are used
at higher frequencies (87.5-108.0 MHz). In AM radio, the information is transmitted by varying the amplitude
of the wave (Figure 6.5). In FM radio, by contrast, the amplitude is constant and the instantaneous frequency
varies.
Chemistry in Everyday Life
Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 285
Figure 6.5 This schematic depicts how amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) can be
used to transmit a radio wave.
Other technologies also operate in the radio-wave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. For example, 4G
cellular telephone signals are approximately 880 MHz, while Global Positioning System (GPS) signals operate
at 1.228 and 1.575 GHz, local area wireless technology (Wi-Fi) networks operate at 2.4 to 5 GHz, and highway
toll sensors operate at 5.8 GHz. The frequencies associated with these applications are convenient because
such waves tend not to be absorbed much by common building materials.
One particularly characteristic phenomenon of waves results when two or more waves come into contact: They
interfere with each other. Figure 6.6 shows the interference patterns that arise when light passes through narrow
slits closely spaced about a wavelength apart. The fringe patterns produced depend on the wavelength, with the
fringes being more closely spaced for shorter wavelength light passing through a given set of slits. When the light
passes through the two slits, each slit effectively acts as a new source, resulting in two closely spaced waves coming
into contact at the detector (the camera in this case). The dark regions in Figure 6.6 correspond to regions where
the peaks for the wave from one slit happen to coincide with the troughs for the wave from the other slit (destructive
interference), while the brightest regions correspond to the regions where the peaks for the two waves (or their two
troughs) happen to coincide (constructive interference). Likewise, when two stones are tossed close together into a
pond, interference patterns are visible in the interactions between the waves produced by the stones. Such interference
patterns cannot be explained by particles moving according to the laws of classical mechanics.

Dorothy Hodgkin
Because the wavelengths of X-rays (10-10,000 picometers [pm]) are comparable to the size of atoms, X-rays
can be used to determine the structure of molecules. When a beam of X-rays is passed through molecules
packed together in a crystal, the X-rays collide with the electrons and scatter. Constructive and destructive
interference of these scattered X-rays creates a specific diffraction pattern. Calculating backward from this
pattern, the positions of each of the atoms in the molecule can be determined very precisely. One of the
pioneers who helped create this technology was Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin.
She was born in Cairo, Egypt, in 1910, where her British parents were studying archeology. Even as a young
girl, she was fascinated with minerals and crystals. When she was a student at Oxford University, she began
researching how X-ray crystallography could be used to determine the structure of biomolecules. She invented
new techniques that allowed her and her students to determine the structures of vitamin B12, penicillin, and
many other important molecules. Diabetes, a disease that affects 382 million people worldwide, involves the
hormone insulin. Hodgkin began studying the structure of insulin in 1934, but it required several decades of
advances in the field before she finally reported the structure in 1969. Understanding the structure has led to
better understanding of the disease and treatment options.
Not all waves are travelling waves. Standing waves (also known as stationary waves) remain constrained within
some region of space. As we shall see, standing waves play an important role in our understanding of the electronic
structure of atoms and molecules. The simplest example of a standing wave is a one-dimensional wave associated
with a vibrating string that is held fixed at its two end points. Figure 6.7 shows the four lowest-energy standing
waves (the fundamental wave and the lowest three harmonics) for a vibrating string at a particular amplitude.
Although the string's motion lies mostly within a plane, the wave itself is considered to be one dimensional, since
it lies along the length of the string. The motion of string segments in a direction perpendicular to the string length
generates the waves and so the amplitude of the waves is visible as the maximum displacement of the curves seen
in Figure 6.7. The key observation from the figure is that only those waves having an integer number, n, of half-
wavelengths between the end points can form. A system with fixed end points such as this restricts the number and
type of the possible waveforms. This is an example of quantization, in which only discrete values from a more
general set of continuous values of some property are observed. Another important observation is that the harmonic
waves (those waves displaying more than one-half wavelength) all have one or more points between the two end
points that are not in motion. These special points are nodes. The energies of the standing waves with a given
amplitude in a vibrating string increase with the number of half-wavelengths n. Since the number of nodes is n – 1,
the energy can also be said to depend on the number of nodes, generally increasing as the number of nodes increases.

Figure 6.7 A vibrating string shows some one-dimensional standing waves. Since the two end points of the string
are held fixed, only waves having an integer number of half-wavelengths can form. The points on the string between
the end points that are not moving are called the nodes.
An example of two-dimensional standing waves is shown in Figure 6.8, which shows the vibrational patterns on
a flat surface. Although the vibrational amplitudes cannot be seen like they could in the vibrating string, the nodes
have been made visible by sprinkling the drum surface with a powder that collects on the areas of the surface that
have minimal displacement. For one-dimensional standing waves, the nodes were points on the line, but for two-
dimensional standing waves, the nodes are lines on the surface (for three-dimensional standing waves, the nodes are
two-dimensional surfaces within the three-dimensional volume).

Blackbody Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe
The last few decades of the nineteenth century witnessed intense research activity in commercializing newly
discovered electric lighting. This required obtaining a better understanding of the distributions of light emitted
from various sources being considered. Artificial lighting is usually designed to mimic natural sunlight within the
limitations of the underlying technology. Such lighting consists of a range of broadly distributed frequencies that form
a continuous spectrum. Figure 6.9 shows the wavelength distribution for sunlight. The most intense radiation is
in the visible region, with the intensity dropping off rapidly for shorter wavelength ultraviolet (UV) light, and more
slowly for longer wavelength infrared (IR) light.

Figure 6.9 The spectral distribution (light intensity vs. wavelength) of sunlight reaches the Earth's atmosphere as UV
light, visible light, and IR light. The unabsorbed sunlight at the top of the atmosphere has a distribution that
approximately matches the theoretical distribution of a blackbody at 5250 °C, represented by the blue curve. (credit:
modification of work by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Terrestrial Reference Spectra for
Photovoltaic Performance Evaluation)
In Figure 6.9, the solar distribution is compared to a representative distribution, called a blackbody spectrum,
that corresponds to a temperature of 5250 °C. The blackbody spectrum matches the solar spectrum quite well. A
blackbody is a convenient, ideal emitter that approximates the behavior of many materials when heated. It is “ideal”
in the same sense that an ideal gas is a convenient, simple representation of real gases that works well, provided
that the pressure is not too high nor the temperature too low. A good approximation of a blackbody that can be used
to observe blackbody radiation is a metal oven that can be heated to very high temperatures. The oven has a small
hole allowing for the light being emitted within the oven to be observed with a spectrometer so that the wavelengths
and their intensities can be measured. Figure 6.10 shows the resulting curves for some representative temperatures.
Each distribution depends only on a single parameter: the temperature. The maxima in the blackbody curves, λmax,
shift to shorter wavelengths as the temperature increases, reflecting the observation that metals being heated to high
temperatures begin to glow a darker red that becomes brighter as the temperature increases, eventually becoming
white hot at very high temperatures as the intensities of all of the visible wavelengths become appreciable. This
common observation was at the heart of the first paradox that showed the fundamental limitations of classical physics
that we will examine.
Physicists derived mathematical expressions for the blackbody curves using well-accepted concepts from the theories
of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism. The theoretical expressions as functions of temperature fit the
observed experimental blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths, but showed significant discrepancies at shorter
wavelengths. Not only did the theoretical curves not show a peak, they absurdly showed the intensity becoming
infinitely large as the wavelength became smaller, which would imply that everyday objects at room temperature
should be emitting large amounts of UV light. This became known as the “ultraviolet catastrophe” because no one
290 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements

could find any problems with the theoretical treatment that could lead to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior.
Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for blackbody radiation that fit the experimental
observations exactly (within experimental error). Planck developed his theoretical treatment by extending the earlier
work that had been based on the premise that the atoms composing the oven vibrated at increasing frequencies
(or decreasing wavelengths) as the temperature increased, with these vibrations being the source of the emitted
electromagnetic radiation. But where the earlier treatments had allowed the vibrating atoms to have any energy values
obtained from a continuous set of energies (perfectly reasonable, according to classical physics), Planck found that by
restricting the vibrational energies to discrete values for each frequency, he could derive an expression for blackbody
radiation that correctly had the intensity dropping rapidly for the short wavelengths in the UV region.
E = nhν, n = 1, 2, 3, . . .
The quantity h is a constant now known as Planck's constant, in his honor. Although Planck was pleased he had
resolved the blackbody radiation paradox, he was disturbed that to do so, he needed to assume the vibrating atoms
required quantized energies, which he was unable to explain. The value of Planck's constant is very small, 6.626
× 10−34 joule seconds (J s), which helps explain why energy quantization had not been observed previously in
macroscopic phenomena.
Figure 6.10 Blackbody spectral distribution curves are shown for some representative temperatures.
The Photoelectric Effect
The next paradox in the classical theory to be resolved concerned the photoelectric effect (Figure 6.11). It had been
observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than
some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend
on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal
had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free
the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its
amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a
given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the
paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually
won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).
Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 291
Einstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could
be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a
wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according
to Planck's formula, E = hν (or, in terms of wavelength using c = νλ, E = hc
λ ). Electrons were ejected when hit
by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater
the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Einstein also argued that the light intensity
did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking
the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing
brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with
some of the electrons.
With Einstein's findings, the nature of light took on a new air of mystery. Although many light phenomena could be
explained either in terms of waves or particles, certain phenomena, such as the interference patterns obtained when
light passed through a double slit, were completely contrary to a particle view of light, while other phenomena, such
as the photoelectric effect, were completely contrary to a wave view of light. Somehow, at a deep fundamental level
still not fully understood, light is both wavelike and particle-like. This is known as wave-particle duality.
Figure 6.11 Photons with low frequencies do not have enough energy to cause electrons to be ejected via the
photoelectric effect. For any frequency of light above the threshold frequency, the kinetic energy of an ejected
electron will increase linearly with the energy of the incoming photon.

Identify which of the following statements are false and, where necessary, change the italicized word or
phrase to make them true, consistent with Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect.
(a) Increasing the brightness of incoming light increases the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons.
(b) Increasing the wavelength of incoming light increases the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons.
(c) Increasing the brightness of incoming light increases the number of ejected electrons.
(d) Increasing the frequency of incoming light can increase the number of ejected electrons.
Solution
(a) False. Increasing the brightness of incoming light has no effect on the kinetic energy of the ejected
electrons. Only energy, not the number or amplitude, of the photons influences the kinetic energy of the
electrons.
(b) False. Increasing the frequency of incoming light increases the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons.
Frequency is proportional to energy and inversely proportional to wavelength. Frequencies above the
threshold value transfer the excess energy into the kinetic energy of the electrons.
(c) True. Because the number of collisions with photons increases with brighter light, the number of ejected
electrons increases.
(d) True with regard to the threshold energy binding the electrons to the metal. Below this threshold,
electrons are not emitted and above it they are. Once over the threshold value, further increasing the
frequency does not increase the number of ejected electrons

Line Spectra
Another paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late nineteenth century struggled

Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 293
with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules. When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated
sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies,
and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is present. Most of the light
generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light
present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be seen in Figure 6.9, sunlight also contains UV light
(shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to
the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that
contains all wavelengths of visible light. These continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation
curves at some appropriate temperature, such as those shown in Figure 6.10.
In contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra having very narrow line widths
interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in Figure 6.13. Exciting a gas at low partial
pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs and neon signs
operate in this way (Figure 6.12). Each element displays its own characteristic set of lines, as do molecules, although
their spectra are generally much more complicated.
Figure 6.12 Neon signs operate by exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current. This sign shows
the elaborate artistic effects that can be achieved. (credit: Dave Shaver)
Each emission line consists of a single wavelength of light, which implies that the light emitted by a gas consists
of a set of discrete energies. For example, when an electric discharge passes through a tube containing hydrogen
gas at low pressure, the H2 molecules are broken apart into separate H atoms and we see a blue-pink color. Passing
the light through a prism produces a line spectrum, indicating that this light is composed of photons of four visible
wavelengths, as shown in Figure 6.13.

Figure 6.13 Compare the two types of emission spectra: continuous spectrum of white light (top) and the line
spectra of the light from excited sodium, hydrogen, calcium, and mercury atoms.
The origin of discrete spectra in atoms and molecules was extremely puzzling to scientists in the late nineteenth
century, since according to classical electromagnetic theory, only continuous spectra should be observed. Even more
puzzling, in 1885, Johann Balmer was able to derive an empirical equation that related the four visible wavelengths
of light emitted by hydrogen atoms to whole integers. That equation is the following one, in which k is a constant:
1
λ = k⎛
⎝ 1
4 − 1

⎞
⎠, n = 3, 4, 5, 6
Other discrete lines for the hydrogen atom were found in the UV and IR regions. Johannes Rydberg generalized
Balmer's work and developed an empirical formula that predicted all of hydrogen's emission lines, not just those
restricted to the visible range, where, n1 and n2 are integers, n1 < n2, and R∞ is the Rydberg constant (1.097 × 107
m−1).

Even in the late nineteenth century, spectroscopy was a very precise science, and so the wavelengths of hydrogen
were measured to very high accuracy, which implied that the Rydberg constant could be determined very precisely
as well. That such a simple formula as the Rydberg formula could account for such precise measurements seemed
astounding at the time, but it was the eventual explanation for emission spectra by Neils Bohr in 1913 that ultimately
convinced scientists to abandon classical physics and spurred the development of modern quantum mechanics.
Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 295
6.2 The Bohr Model
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom
• Use the Rydberg equation to calculate energies of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen atoms
Following the work of Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues in the early twentieth century, the picture of atoms
consisting of tiny dense nuclei surrounded by lighter and even tinier electrons continually moving about the nucleus
was well established. This picture was called the planetary model, since it pictured the atom as a miniature “solar
system” with the electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbiting the sun. The simplest atom is hydrogen,
consisting of a single proton as the nucleus about which a single electron moves. The electrostatic force attracting the
electron to the proton depends only on the distance between the two particles. This classical mechanics description of
the atom is incomplete, however, since an electron moving in an elliptical orbit would be accelerating (by changing
direction) and, according to classical electromagnetism, it should continuously emit electromagnetic radiation. This
loss in orbital energy should result in the electron’s orbit getting continually smaller until it spirals into the nucleus,
implying that atoms are inherently unstable.
In 1913, Niels Bohr attempted to resolve the atomic paradox by ignoring classical electromagnetism’s prediction that
the orbiting electron in hydrogen would continuously emit light. Instead, he incorporated into the classical mechanics
description of the atom Planck’s ideas of quantization and Einstein’s finding that light consists of photons whose
energy is proportional to their frequency. Bohr assumed that the electron orbiting the nucleus would not normally
emit any radiation (the stationary state hypothesis), but it would emit or absorb a photon if it moved to a different
orbit. The energy absorbed or emitted would reflect differences in the orbital energies according to this equation:
∣ ΔE ∣ = ∣ Ef − Ei ∣ = hν = hc
λ
In this equation, h is Planck’s constant and Ei and Ef are the initial and final orbital energies, respectively. The absolute
value of the energy difference is used, since frequencies and wavelengths are always positive. Instead of allowing for
continuous values of energy, Bohr assumed the energies of these electron orbitals were quantized:
En = − k
n2 , n = 1, 2, 3, …
In this expression, k is a constant comprising fundamental constants such as the electron mass and charge and Planck’s
constant. Inserting the expression for the orbit energies into the equation for ΔE gives
ΔE = k
⎛
⎝

or

λ = k

⎛
⎝
⎜ 1

⎠
⎟
which is identical to the Rydberg equation in which R∞ = k
hc. When Bohr calculated his theoretical value for the
Rydberg constant, R∞, and compared it with the experimentally accepted value, he got excellent agreement. Since
the Rydberg constant was one of the most precisely measured constants at that time, this level of agreement was
astonishing and meant that Bohr’s model was taken seriously, despite the many assumptions that Bohr needed to
derive it.
The lowest few energy levels are shown in Figure 6.14. One of the fundamental laws of physics is that matter is
most stable with the lowest possible energy. Thus, the electron in a hydrogen atom usually moves in the n = 1 orbit,
the orbit in which it has the lowest energy. When the electron is in this lowest energy orbit, the atom is said to be in its
ground electronic state (or simply ground state). If the atom receives energy from an outside source, it is possible for
296 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
the electron to move to an orbit with a higher n value and the atom is now in an excited electronic state (or simply
an excited state) with a higher energy. When an electron transitions from an excited state (higher energy orbit) to a
less excited state, or ground state, the difference in energy is emitted as a photon. Similarly, if a photon is absorbed
by an atom, the energy of the photon moves an electron from a lower energy orbit up to a more excited one. We can
relate the energy of electrons in atoms to what we learned previously about energy. The law of conservation of energy
says that we can neither create nor destroy energy. Thus, if a certain amount of external energy is required to excite
an electron from one energy level to another, that same amount of energy will be liberated when the electron returns
to its initial state (Figure 6.15).
Since Bohr’s model involved only a single electron, it could also be applied to the single electron ions He+, Li2+,
Be3+, and so forth, which differ from hydrogen only in their nuclear charges, and so one-electron atoms and ions are
collectively referred to as hydrogen-like atoms. The energy expression for hydrogen-like atoms is a generalization of
the hydrogen atom energy, in which Z is the nuclear charge (+1 for hydrogen, +2 for He, +3 for Li, and so on) and k
has a value of 2.179 × 10–18 J.
En = −kZ 2
n2
The sizes of the circular orbits for hydrogen-like atoms are given in terms of their radii by the following expression,
in which α0 is a constant called the Bohr radius, with a value of 5.292 × 10−11 m:
r = n2
Z a0
The equation also shows us that as the electron’s energy increases (as n increases), the electron is found at greater
distances from the nucleus. This is implied by the inverse dependence of electrostatic attraction on distance, since,
as the electron moves away from the nucleus, the electrostatic attraction between it and the nucleus decreases and it
is held less tightly in the atom. Note that as n gets larger and the orbits get larger, their energies get closer to zero,
and so the limits n ⟶ ∞ and r ⟶ ∞ imply that E = 0 corresponds to the ionization limit where the electron is
completely removed from the nucleus. Thus, for hydrogen in the ground state n = 1, the ionization energy would be:
ΔE = En ⟶ ∞ − E1 = 0 + k = k
With three extremely puzzling paradoxes now solved (blackbody radiation, the photoelectric effect, and the hydrogen
atom), and all involving Planck’s constant in a fundamental manner, it became clear to most physicists at that time
that the classical theories that worked so well in the macroscopic world were fundamentally flawed and could not
be extended down into the microscopic domain of atoms and molecules. Unfortunately, despite Bohr’s remarkable
achievement in deriving a theoretical expression for the Rydberg constant, he was unable to extend his theory to the
next simplest atom, He, which only has two electrons. Bohr’s model was severely flawed, since it was still based on
the classical mechanics notion of precise orbits, a concept that was later found to be untenable in the microscopic
domain, when a proper model of quantum mechanics was developed to supersede classical mechanics.

Bohr’s model of the hydrogen atom provides insight into the behavior of matter at the microscopic level, but it is
does not account for electron–electron interactions in atoms with more than one electron. It does introduce several
important features of all models used to describe the distribution of electrons in an atom. These features include the
following:
• The energies of electrons (energy levels) in an atom are quantized, described by quantum numbers: integer
numbers having only specific allowed value and used to characterize the arrangement of electrons in an atom.
• An electron’s energy increases with increasing distance from the nucleus.
• The discrete energies (lines) in the spectra of the elements result from quantized electronic energies.
Of these features, the most important is the postulate of quantized energy levels for an electron in an atom. As a
consequence, the model laid the foundation for the quantum mechanical model of the atom. Bohr won a Nobel Prize
in Physics for his contributions to our understanding of the structure of atoms and how that is related to line spectra
emissions.
6.3 Development of Quantum Theory
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Extend the concept of wave–particle duality that was observed in electromagnetic radiation to matter as well
• Understand the general idea of the quantum mechanical description of electrons in an atom, and that it uses
the notion of three-dimensional wave functions, or orbitals, that define the distribution of probability to find
an electron in a particular part of space
• List and describe traits of the four quantum numbers that form the basis for completely specifying the state
of an electron in an atom
Bohr’s model explained the experimental data for the hydrogen atom and was widely accepted, but it also raised many
questions. Why did electrons orbit at only fixed distances defined by a single quantum number n = 1, 2, 3, and so
on, but never in between? Why did the model work so well describing hydrogen and one-electron ions, but could not
correctly predict the emission spectrum for helium or any larger atoms? To answer these questions, scientists needed
to completely revise the way they thought about matter.

Behavior in the Microscopic World
We know how matter behaves in the macroscopic world—objects that are large enough to be seen by the naked eye
follow the rules of classical physics. A billiard ball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in
a straight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is acted on by some other force (such as
friction). The ball has a well-defined position and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, p = mv, defined by mass m
and velocity v) at any given moment. In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is the typical
behavior of a classical object.
When waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not displayed by macroscopic particles
such as the billiard ball. For example, interacting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patters
similar to those shown on Figure 6.16. This is a case of wave behavior on the macroscopic scale, and it is clear that
particles and waves are very different phenomena in the macroscopic realm.
Figure 6.16 An interference pattern on the water surface is formed by interacting waves. The waves are caused by
reflection of water from the rocks. (credit: modification of work by Sukanto Debnath)
As technological improvements allowed scientists to probe the microscopic world in greater detail, it became
increasingly clear by the 1920s that very small pieces of matter follow a different set of rules from those we observe
for large objects. The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the case for the microscopic
world.
One of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the microscopic world was Louis de Broglie.
He asked the question: If electromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and other
submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral dissertation, de Broglie extended the
wave–particle duality of light that Einstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles. He
predicted that a particle with mass m and velocity v (that is, with linear momentum p) should also exhibit the behavior
of a wave with a wavelength value λ, given by this expression in which h is the familiar Planck’s constant:
λ = h
mv = h
p
This is called the de Broglie wavelength. Unlike the other values of λ discussed in this chapter, the de Broglie
wavelength is a characteristic of particles and other bodies, not electromagnetic radiation (note that this equation
involves velocity [v, m/s], not frequency [ν, Hz]. Although these two symbols appear nearly identical, they mean
very different things). Where Bohr had postulated the electron as being a particle orbiting the nucleus in quantized
orbits, de Broglie argued that Bohr’s assumption of quantization can be explained if the electron is considered not as
a particle, but rather as a circular standing wave such that only an integer number of wavelengths could fit exactly
within the orbit (Figure 6.17).
Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 301
Figure 6.17 If an electron is viewed as a wave circling around the nucleus, an integer number of wavelengths must
fit into the orbit for this standing wave behavior to be possible.
For a circular orbit of radius r, the circumference is 2πr, and so de Broglie’s condition is:
2πr = nλ, n = 1, 2, 3, …
Shortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at Bell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and
L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference
pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served
as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be
similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used
a crystalline nickel target for their “slits,” since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the
same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. Figure 6.18 shows an interference pattern. It
is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in Electromagnetic Energy for light passing through
two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave–particle duality of matter can be seen in Figure 6.18 by observing what
happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been
recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random.
As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike
behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow
the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation.
Thus the wave–particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum
particles.

Calculating the Wavelength of a Particle
If an electron travels at a velocity of 1.000 × 107 m s–1 and has a mass of 9.109 × 10–28 g, what is its
wavelength?
Solution
We can use de Broglie’s equation to solve this problem, but we first must do a unit conversion of Planck’s
constant. You learned earlier that 1 J = 1 kg m2/s2. Thus, we can write h = 6.626 × 10–34 J s as 6.626 ×

This is a small value, but it is significantly larger than the size of an electron in the classical (particle) view.
This size is the same order of magnitude as the size of an atom. This means that electron wavelike behavior
is going to be noticeable in an atom.

Calculate the wavelength of a softball with a mass of 100 g traveling at a velocity of 35 m s–1, assuming
that it can be modeled as a single particle.
Answer: 1.9 × 10–34 m. We never think of a thrown softball having a wavelength, since this wavelength is
so small it is impossible for our senses or any known instrument to detect (strictly speaking, the wavelength
of a real baseball would correspond to the wavelengths of its constituent atoms and molecules, which, while
much larger than this value, would still be microscopically tiny). The de Broglie wavelength is only
appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.
Werner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other
microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a
particle’s position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle,
the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now
call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly
both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass m moving with velocity vx in the x direction
(or equivalently with momentum px), the product of the uncertainty in the position, Δx, and the uncertainty in the
momentum, Δpx , must be greater than or equal to
ℏ
2 (where
ℏ = h
2π, the value of Planck’s constant divided by
2π).
Δx × Δpx = (Δx)(mΔv) ≥
ℏ
2
This equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of
an object and its momentum. For example, if we improve our measurement of an electron’s position so that the
uncertainty in the position (Δx) has a value of, say, 1 pm (10–12 m, about 1% of the diameter of a hydrogen atom),
then our determination of its momentum must have an uncertainty with a value of at least
⎡
⎣Δp = mΔv = h

⎤
⎦ =

⎠
⎛
⎝2 × 1 × 10−12 m⎞
⎠
= 5 × 10−23 kg m/s.
The value of ħ is not large, so the uncertainty in the position or momentum of a macroscopic object like a baseball is
too insignificant to observe. However, the mass of a microscopic object such as an electron is small enough that the
uncertainty can be large and significant.
It should be noted that Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is not just limited to uncertainties in position and
momentum, but it also links other dynamical variables. For example, when an atom absorbs a photon and makes a
transition from one energy state to another, the uncertainty in the energy and the uncertainty in the time required for
the transition are similarly related, as ΔE Δt ≥
ℏ
2 .
Heisenberg’s principle imposes ultimate limits on what is knowable in science. The uncertainty principle can be
shown to be a consequence of wave–particle duality, which lies at the heart of what distinguishes modern quantum
theory from classical mechanics.

The Quantum–Mechanical Model of an Atom
Shortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as
being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended
de Broglie’s work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his
equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr’s expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg
formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or
wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, ψ. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of
the wavefunction ψ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by ψ are
not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction
∣ψ∣2 describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that
wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron’s density with respect to the nucleus in an
atom. In the most general form, the Schrödinger equation can be written as:
H
^ ψ = Eψ
H
^ is the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations representing the total energy of the quantum particle
(such as an electron in an atom), ψ is the wavefunction of this particle that can be used to find the special distribution
of the probability of finding the particle, and E is the actual value of the total energy of the particle.
Schrödinger’s work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists following in their footsteps, is generally
referred to as quantum mechanics.
You may also have heard of Schrödinger because of his famous thought experiment. This story
(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16superpos) explains the concepts of superposition and entanglement as
related to a cat in a box with poison.
Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms
The goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons in atoms), their different energies,
and other properties. The use of quantum theory provides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a
precursor to chemical bonding.
As was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energy levels but not between them. It is
said that the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values and
can jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or stay between these levels.
The energy levels are labeled with an n value, where n = 1, 2, 3, …. Generally speaking, the energy of an electron
in an atom is greater for greater values of n. This number, n, is referred to as the principal quantum number. The
principal quantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially the same concept as the n in the
Bohr atom description. Another name for the principal quantum number is the shell number. The shells of an atom

Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 305
can be thought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons that belong to a specific shell are
most likely to be found within the corresponding circular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher
the shell number, and so the higher the energy level (Figure 6.19). The positively charged protons in the nucleus
stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attraction between the positive charges of the protons and the negative
charges of the electrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater the energy it has.
Figure 6.19 Different shells are numbered by principal quantum numbers.
This quantum mechanical model for where electrons reside in an atom can be used to look at electronic transitions, the
events when an electron moves from one energy level to another. If the transition is to a higher energy level, energy
is absorbed, and the energy change has a positive value. To obtain the amount of energy necessary for the transition
to a higher energy level, a photon is absorbed by the atom. A transition to a lower energy level involves a release of
energy, and the energy change is negative. This process is accompanied by emission of a photon by the atom. The
following equation summarizes these relationships and is based on the hydrogen atom:
ΔE = Efinal − Einitial
= −2.18 × 10−18 ⎛
⎝
⎜ 1
nf
2 − 1
ni
2
⎞
⎠
⎟ J
The values nf and ni are the final and initial energy states of the electron. Example 6.5 in the previous section of the
chapter demonstrates calculations of such energy changes.
The principal quantum number is one of three quantum numbers used to characterize an orbital. An atomic orbital
is a general region in an atom within which an electron is most probable to reside. The quantum mechanical model
specifies the probability of finding an electron in the three-dimensional space around the nucleus and is based on
solutions of the Schrödinger equation. In addition, the principal quantum number defines the energy of an electron
in a hydrogen or hydrogen-like atom or an ion (an atom or an ion with only one electron) and the general region in
which discrete energy levels of electrons in a multi-electron atoms and ions are located.
Another quantum number is l, the secondary (angular momentum) quantum number. It is an integer that may take
the values, l = 0, 1, 2, …, n – 1. This means that an orbital with n = 1 can have only one value of l, l = 0, whereas n =
2 permits l = 0 and l = 1, and so on. Whereas the principal quantum number, n, defines the general size and energy of
the orbital, the secondary quantum number l specifies the shape of the orbital. Orbitals with the same value of l define
a subshell.
Orbitals with l = 0 are called s orbitals and they make up the s subshells. The value l = 1 corresponds to the p orbitals.
For a given n, p orbitals constitute a p subshell (e.g., 3p if n = 3). The orbitals with l = 2 are called the d orbitals,
followed by the f-, g-, and h-orbitals for l = 3, 4, and 5.
There are certain distances from the nucleus at which the probability density of finding an electron located at a
306 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
particular orbital is zero. In other words, the value of the wavefunction ψ is zero at this distance for this orbital. Such
a value of radius r is called a radial node. The number of radial nodes in an orbital is n – l – 1.
Figure 6.20 The graphs show the probability (y axis) of finding an electron for the 1s, 2s, 3s orbitals as a function of
distance from the nucleus.
Consider the examples in Figure 6.20. The orbitals depicted are of the s type, thus l = 0 for all of them. It can be
seen from the graphs of the probability densities that there are 1 – 0 – 1 = 0 places where the density is zero (nodes)
for 1s (n = 1), 2 – 0 – 1 = 1 node for 2s, and 3 – 0 – 1 = 2 nodes for the 3s orbitals.
The s subshell electron density distribution is spherical and the p subshell has a dumbbell shape. The d and f orbitals
are more complex. These shapes represent the three-dimensional regions within which the electron is likely to be
found.
Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 307
Figure 6.21 Shapes of s, p, d, and f orbitals.
The magnetic quantum number, ml, specifies the relative spatial orientation of a particular orbital. Generally
speaking, ml can be equal to –l, –(l – 1), …, 0, …, (l – 1), l. The total number of possible orbitals with the same value
of l (that is, in the same subshell) is 2l + 1. Thus, there is one s-orbital in an s subshell (l = 0), there are three p-orbitals
308 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements

in a p subshell (l = 1), five d-orbitals in a d subshell (l = 2), seven f-orbitals in an f subshell (l = 3), and so forth.
The principal quantum number defines the general value of the electronic energy. The angular momentum quantum
number determines the shape of the orbital. And the magnetic quantum number specifies orientation of the orbital in
space, as can be seen in Figure 6.21.
Figure 6.22 The chart shows the energies of electron orbitals in a multi-electron atom.
Figure 6.22 illustrates the energy levels for various orbitals. The number before the orbital name (such as 2s, 3p,
and so forth) stands for the principal quantum number, n. The letter in the orbital name defines the subshell with a
specific angular momentum quantum number l = 0 for s orbitals, 1 for p orbitals, 2 for d orbitals. Finally, there are
more than one possible orbitals for l ≥ 1, each corresponding to a specific value of ml. In the case of a hydrogen atom
or a one-electron ion (such as He+, Li2+, and so on), energies of all the orbitals with the same n are the same. This is
called a degeneracy, and the energy levels for the same principal quantum number, n, are called degenerate orbitals.
However, in atoms with more than one electron, this degeneracy is eliminated by the electron–electron interactions,
and orbitals that belong to different subshells have different energies, as shown on Figure 6.22. Orbitals within the
same subshell are still degenerate and have the same energy.
While the three quantum numbers discussed in the previous paragraphs work well for describing electron orbitals,
some experiments showed that they were not sufficient to explain all observed results. It was demonstrated in the
1920s that when hydrogen-line spectra are examined at extremely high resolution, some lines are actually not single
peaks but, rather, pairs of closely spaced lines. This is the so-called fine structure of the spectrum, and it implies that
there are additional small differences in energies of electrons even when they are located in the same orbital. These
observations led Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck to propose that electrons have a fourth quantum number.
They called this the spin quantum number, or ms.
The other three quantum numbers, n, l, and ml, are properties of specific atomic orbitals that also define in what part of
the space an electron is most likely to be located. Orbitals are a result of solving the Schrödinger equation for electrons
in atoms. The electron spin is a different kind of property. It is a completely quantum phenomenon with no analogues
in the classical realm. In addition, it cannot be derived from solving the Schrödinger equation and is not related to the
normal spatial coordinates (such as the Cartesian x, y, and z). Electron spin describes an intrinsic electron "rotation"
or "spinning." Each electron acts as a tiny magnet or a tiny rotating object with an angular momentum, or as a loop
with an electric current, even though this rotation or current cannot be observed in terms of spatial coordinates.
The magnitude of the overall electron spin can only have one value, and an electron can only “spin” in one of two
quantized states. One is termed the α state, with the z component of the spin being in the positive direction of the z
axis. This corresponds to the spin quantum number ms = 1
2. The other is called the β state, with the z component of
Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 309
the spin being negative and ms = − 1
2. Any electron, regardless of the atomic orbital it is located in, can only have
one of those two values of the spin quantum number. The energies of electrons having ms = − 1
2 and ms = 1
2 are
different if an external magnetic field is applied.
Figure 6.23 Electrons with spin values ± 1
2 in an external magnetic field.
Figure 6.23 illustrates this phenomenon. An electron acts like a tiny magnet. Its moment is directed up (in the
positive direction of the z axis) for the 1
2 spin quantum number and down (in the negative z direction) for the spin
quantum number of − 1
2. A magnet has a lower energy if its magnetic moment is aligned with the external magnetic
field (the left electron on Figure 6.23) and a higher energy for the magnetic moment being opposite to the applied
field. This is why an electron with ms = 1
2 has a slightly lower energy in an external field in the positive z direction,
and an electron with ms = − 1
2 has a slightly higher energy in the same field. This is true even for an electron
occupying the same orbital in an atom. A spectral line corresponding to a transition for electrons from the same orbital
but with different spin quantum numbers has two possible values of energy; thus, the line in the spectrum will show
a fine structure splitting.
The Pauli Exclusion Principle
An electron in an atom is completely described by four quantum numbers: n, l, ml, and ms. The first three quantum
numbers define the orbital and the fourth quantum number describes the intrinsic electron property called spin. An
Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle that gives the last piece of information that we need
to understand the general behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated as follows:
No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of all the four quantum numbers. What this means
is that two electrons can share the same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers n, l, and ml) only if their spin
quantum numbers ms have different values. Since the spin quantum number can only have two values ⎛
⎝± 1
2
⎞
⎠, no
more than two electrons can occupy the same orbital (and if two electrons are located in the same orbital, they must
have opposite spins). Therefore, any atomic orbital can be populated by only zero, one, or two electrons.
The properties and meaning of the quantum numbers of electrons in atoms are briefly summarized in Table 6.1.

Working with Shells and Subshells
Indicate the number of subshells, the number of orbitals in each subshell, and the values of l and ml for the
orbitals in the n = 4 shell of an atom.
Solution
For n = 4, l can have values of 0, 1, 2, and 3. Thus, s, p, d, and f subshells are found in the n = 4 shell of
an atom. For l = 0 (the s subshell), ml can only be 0. Thus, there is only one 4s orbital. For l = 1 (p-type
orbitals), m can have values of –1, 0, +1, so we find three 4p orbitals. For l = 2 (d-type orbitals), ml can have
values of –2, –1, 0, +1, +2, so we have five 4d orbitals. When l = 3 (f-type orbitals), ml can have values of
–3, –2, –1, 0, +1, +2, +3, and we can have seven 4f orbitals. Thus, we find a total of 16 orbitals in the n = 4
shell of an atom.

Calculate the maximum number of electrons that can occupy a shell with (a) n = 2, (b) n = 5, and (c) n as a

Solution
(a) When n = 2, there are four orbitals (a single 2s orbital, and three orbitals labeled 2p). These four orbitals
can contain eight electrons.
(b) When n = 5, there are five subshells of orbitals that we need to sum:

Again, each orbital holds two electrons, so 50 electrons can fit in this shell.

Configurations)

Having introduced the basics of atomic structure and quantum mechanics, we can use our understanding of quantum
numbers to determine how atomic orbitals relate to one another. This allows us to determine which orbitals are
occupied by electrons in each atom. The specific arrangement of electrons in orbitals of an atom determines many of
the chemical properties of that atom.
Orbital Energies and Atomic Structure
The energy of atomic orbitals increases as the principal quantum number, n, increases. In any atom with two or more
electrons, the repulsion between the electrons makes energies of subshells with different values of l differ so that the
energy of the orbitals increases within a shell in the order s < p < d < f. Figure 6.24 depicts how these two trends
in increasing energy relate. The 1s orbital at the bottom of the diagram is the orbital with electrons of lowest energy.
The energy increases as we move up to the 2s and then 2p, 3s, and 3p orbitals, showing that the increasing n value has
more influence on energy than the increasing l value for small atoms. However, this pattern does not hold for larger
atoms. The 3d orbital is higher in energy than the 4s orbital. Such overlaps continue to occur frequently as we move
up the chart.
Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 313
Figure 6.24 Generalized energy-level diagram for atomic orbitals in an atom with two or more electrons (not to
scale).
Electrons in successive atoms on the periodic table tend to fill low-energy orbitals first. Thus, many students find
it confusing that, for example, the 5p orbitals fill immediately after the 4d, and immediately before the 6s. The
filling order is based on observed experimental results, and has been confirmed by theoretical calculations. As the
principal quantum number, n, increases, the size of the orbital increases and the electrons spend more time farther
from the nucleus. Thus, the attraction to the nucleus is weaker and the energy associated with the orbital is higher (less
stabilized). But this is not the only effect we have to take into account. Within each shell, as the value of l increases,
the electrons are less penetrating (meaning there is less electron density found close to the nucleus), in the order s
> p > d > f. Electrons that are closer to the nucleus slightly repel electrons that are farther out, offsetting the more
dominant electron–nucleus attractions slightly (recall that all electrons have −1 charges, but nuclei have +Z charges).
This phenomenon is called shielding and will be discussed in more detail in the next section. Electrons in orbitals
that experience more shielding are less stabilized and thus higher in energy. For small orbitals (1s through 3p), the
increase in energy due to n is more significant than the increase due to l; however, for larger orbitals the two trends
are comparable and cannot be simply predicted. We will discuss methods for remembering the observed order.
The arrangement of electrons in the orbitals of an atom is called the electron configuration of the atom. We describe
an electron configuration with a symbol that contains three pieces of information (Figure 6.25):
1. The number of the principal quantum shell, n,
2. The letter that designates the orbital type (the subshell, l), and
3. A superscript number that designates the number of electrons in that particular subshell.
For example, the notation 2p4 (read "two–p–four") indicates four electrons in a p subshell (l = 1) with a principal
quantum number (n) of 2. The notation 3d8 (read "three–d–eight") indicates eight electrons in the d subshell (i.e., l =
2) of the principal shell for which n = 3.

Figure 6.25 The diagram of an electron configuration specifies the subshell (n and l value, with letter symbol) and
superscript number of electrons.
The Aufbau Principle
To determine the electron configuration for any particular atom, we can “build” the structures in the order of atomic
numbers. Beginning with hydrogen, and continuing across the periods of the periodic table, we add one proton at
a time to the nucleus and one electron to the proper subshell until we have described the electron configurations
of all the elements. This procedure is called the Aufbau principle, from the German word Aufbau (“to build up”).
Each added electron occupies the subshell of lowest energy available (in the order shown in Figure 6.24), subject
to the limitations imposed by the allowed quantum numbers according to the Pauli exclusion principle. Electrons
enter higher-energy subshells only after lower-energy subshells have been filled to capacity. Figure 6.26 illustrates
the traditional way to remember the filling order for atomic orbitals. Since the arrangement of the periodic table
is based on the electron configurations, Figure 6.27 provides an alternative method for determining the electron
configuration. The filling order simply begins at hydrogen and includes each subshell as you proceed in increasing
Z order. For example, after filling the 3p block up to Ar, we see the orbital will be 4s (K, Ca), followed by the 3d
orbitals.
Figure 6.26 This diagram depicts the energy order for atomic orbitals and is useful for deriving ground-state electron
configurations.
Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 315
Figure 6.27 This periodic table shows the electron configuration for each subshell. By “building up” from hydrogen,
this table can be used to determine the electron configuration for any atom on the periodic table.
We will now construct the ground-state electron configuration and orbital diagram for a selection of atoms in the first
and second periods of the periodic table. Orbital diagrams are pictorial representations of the electron configuration,
showing the individual orbitals and the pairing arrangement of electrons. We start with a single hydrogen atom
(atomic number 1), which consists of one proton and one electron. Referring to Figure 6.26 or Figure 6.27, we
would expect to find the electron in the 1s orbital. By convention, the ms = + 1
2 value is usually filled first. The
electron configuration and the orbital diagram are:
Following hydrogen is the noble gas helium, which has an atomic number of 2. The helium atom contains two protons
and two electrons. The first electron has the same four quantum numbers as the hydrogen atom electron (n = 1, l =
0, ml = 0, ms = + 1
2 ). The second electron also goes into the 1s orbital and fills that orbital. The second electron
has the same n, l, and ml quantum numbers, but must have the opposite spin quantum number, ms = − 1
2. This is in
accord with the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four quantum
numbers. For orbital diagrams, this means two arrows go in each box (representing two electrons in each orbital)

and the arrows must point in opposite directions (representing paired spins). The electron configuration and orbital
diagram of helium are:
The n = 1 shell is completely filled in a helium atom.
The next atom is the alkali metal lithium with an atomic number of 3. The first two electrons in lithium fill the
1s orbital and have the same sets of four quantum numbers as the two electrons in helium. The remaining electron
must occupy the orbital of next lowest energy, the 2s orbital (Figure 6.26 or Figure 6.27). Thus, the electron
configuration and orbital diagram of lithium are:
An atom of the alkaline earth metal beryllium, with an atomic number of 4, contains four protons in the nucleus and
four electrons surrounding the nucleus. The fourth electron fills the remaining space in the 2s orbital.
An atom of boron (atomic number 5) contains five electrons. The n = 1 shell is filled with two electrons and three
electrons will occupy the n = 2 shell. Because any s subshell can contain only two electrons, the fifth electron must
occupy the next energy level, which will be a 2p orbital. There are three degenerate 2p orbitals (ml = −1, 0, +1) and
the electron can occupy any one of these p orbitals. When drawing orbital diagrams, we include empty boxes to depict
any empty orbitals in the same subshell that we are filling.
Carbon (atomic number 6) has six electrons. Four of them fill the 1s and 2s orbitals. The remaining two electrons
occupy the 2p subshell. We now have a choice of filling one of the 2p orbitals and pairing the electrons or of leaving
the electrons unpaired in two different, but degenerate, p orbitals. The orbitals are filled as described by Hund’s
rule: the lowest-energy configuration for an atom with electrons within a set of degenerate orbitals is that having the
maximum number of unpaired electrons. Thus, the two electrons in the carbon 2p orbitals have identical n, l, and ms
quantum numbers and differ in their ml quantum number (in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle). The electron
configuration and orbital diagram for carbon are:
Nitrogen (atomic number 7) fills the 1s and 2s subshells and has one electron in each of the three 2p orbitals, in
accordance with Hund’s rule. These three electrons have unpaired spins. Oxygen (atomic number 8) has a pair of
electrons in any one of the 2p orbitals (the electrons have opposite spins) and a single electron in each of the other
two. Fluorine (atomic number 9) has only one 2p orbital containing an unpaired electron. All of the electrons in the
noble gas neon (atomic number 10) are paired, and all of the orbitals in the n = 1 and the n = 2 shells are filled. The
electron configurations and orbital diagrams of these four elements are:
Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 317
The alkali metal sodium (atomic number 11) has one more electron than the neon atom. This electron must go into
the lowest-energy subshell available, the 3s orbital, giving a 1s22s22p63s1 configuration. The electrons occupying
the outermost shell orbital(s) (highest value of n) are called valence electrons, and those occupying the inner shell
orbitals are called core electrons (Figure 6.28). Since the core electron shells correspond to noble gas electron
configurations, we can abbreviate electron configurations by writing the noble gas that matches the core electron
configuration, along with the valence electrons in a condensed format. For our sodium example, the symbol [Ne]
represents core electrons, (1s22s22p6) and our abbreviated or condensed configuration is [Ne]3s1.
Figure 6.28 A core-abbreviated electron configuration (right) replaces the core electrons with the noble gas symbol
whose configuration matches the core electron configuration of the other element.
Similarly, the abbreviated configuration of lithium can be represented as [He]2s1, where [He] represents the
configuration of the helium atom, which is identical to that of the filled inner shell of lithium. Writing the
configurations in this way emphasizes the similarity of the configurations of lithium and sodium. Both atoms, which
are in the alkali metal family, have only one electron in a valence s subshell outside a filled set of inner shells.
Li: [He]2s1
Na: [Ne]3s1
The alkaline earth metal magnesium (atomic number 12), with its 12 electrons in a [Ne]3s2 configuration, is analogous
to its family member beryllium, [He]2s2. Both atoms have a filled s subshell outside their filled inner shells.
Aluminum (atomic number 13), with 13 electrons and the electron configuration [Ne]3s23p1, is analogous to its family
member boron, [He]2s22p1.
The electron configurations of silicon (14 electrons), phosphorus (15 electrons), sulfur (16 electrons), chlorine
(17 electrons), and argon (18 electrons) are analogous in the electron configurations of their outer shells to their
corresponding family members carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and neon, respectively, except that the principal
quantum number of the outer shell of the heavier elements has increased by one to n = 3. Figure 6.29 shows the
lowest energy, or ground-state, electron configuration for these elements as well as that for atoms of each of the
known elements.

Figure 6.29 This version of the periodic table shows the outer-shell electron configuration of each element. Note
that down each group, the configuration is often similar.
When we come to the next element in the periodic table, the alkali metal potassium (atomic number 19), we might
expect that we would begin to add electrons to the 3d subshell. However, all available chemical and physical evidence
indicates that potassium is like lithium and sodium, and that the next electron is not added to the 3d level but is,
instead, added to the 4s level (Figure 6.29). As discussed previously, the 3d orbital with no radial nodes is higher
in energy because it is less penetrating and more shielded from the nucleus than the 4s, which has three radial
nodes. Thus, potassium has an electron configuration of [Ar]4s1. Hence, potassium corresponds to Li and Na in
its valence shell configuration. The next electron is added to complete the 4s subshell and calcium has an electron
configuration of [Ar]4s2. This gives calcium an outer-shell electron configuration corresponding to that of beryllium
and magnesium.
Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 319
Beginning with the transition metal scandium (atomic number 21), additional electrons are added successively to the
3d subshell. This subshell is filled to its capacity with 10 electrons (remember that for l = 2 [d orbitals], there are 2l
+ 1 = 5 values of ml, meaning that there are five d orbitals that have a combined capacity of 10 electrons). The 4p
subshell fills next. Note that for three series of elements, scandium (Sc) through copper (Cu), yttrium (Y) through
silver (Ag), and lutetium (Lu) through gold (Au), a total of 10 d electrons are successively added to the (n – 1) shell
next to the n shell to bring that (n – 1) shell from 8 to 18 electrons. For two series, lanthanum (La) through lutetium
(Lu) and actinium (Ac) through lawrencium (Lr), 14 f electrons (l = 3, 2l + 1 = 7 ml values; thus, seven orbitals with
a combined capacity of 14 electrons) are successively added to the (n – 2) shell to bring that shell from 18 electrons
to a total of 32 electrons.

Quantum Numbers and Electron Configurations
What is the electron configuration and orbital diagram for a phosphorus atom? What are the four quantum
numbers for the last electron added?
Solution
The atomic number of phosphorus is 15. Thus, a phosphorus atom contains 15 electrons. The order of filling
of the energy levels is 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, . . . The 15 electrons of the phosphorus atom will fill up to the
3p orbital, which will contain three electrons:
The last electron added is a 3p electron. Therefore, n = 3 and, for a p-type orbital, l = 1. The ml value
could be –1, 0, or +1. The three p orbitals are degenerate, so any of these ml values is correct. For unpaired
electrons, convention assigns the value of + 1
2 for the spin quantum number; thus, ms = + 1

Answer: (a) Mn (b) Xe
The periodic table can be a powerful tool in predicting the electron configuration of an element. However, we do find
exceptions to the order of filling of orbitals that are shown in Figure 6.26 or Figure 6.27. For instance, the electron
configurations (shown in Figure 6.29) of the transition metals chromium (Cr; atomic number 24) and copper (Cu;
atomic number 29), among others, are not those we would expect. In general, such exceptions involve subshells with
very similar energy, and small effects can lead to changes in the order of filling.
In the case of Cr and Cu, we find that half-filled and completely filled subshells apparently represent conditions of
preferred stability. This stability is such that an electron shifts from the 4s into the 3d orbital to gain the extra stability
of a half-filled 3d subshell (in Cr) or a filled 3d subshell (in Cu). Other exceptions also occur. For example, niobium
(Nb, atomic number 41) is predicted to have the electron configuration [Kr]5s24d3. Experimentally, we observe that
its ground-state electron configuration is actually [Kr]5s14d4. We can rationalize this observation by saying that the
electron–electron repulsions experienced by pairing the electrons in the 5s orbital are larger than the gap in energy
between the 5s and 4d orbitals. There is no simple method to predict the exceptions for atoms where the magnitude
of the repulsions between electrons is greater than the small differences in energy between subshells.

Electron Configurations and the Periodic Table
As described earlier, the periodic table arranges atoms based on increasing atomic number so that elements with the
same chemical properties recur periodically. When their electron configurations are added to the table (Figure 6.29),
we also see a periodic recurrence of similar electron configurations in the outer shells of these elements. Because they
are in the outer shells of an atom, valence electrons play the most important role in chemical reactions. The outer
electrons have the highest energy of the electrons in an atom and are more easily lost or shared than the core electrons.
Valence electrons are also the determining factor in some physical properties of the elements.
Elements in any one group (or column) have the same number of valence electrons; the alkali metals lithium and
sodium each have only one valence electron, the alkaline earth metals beryllium and magnesium each have two, and
the halogens fluorine and chlorine each have seven valence electrons. The similarity in chemical properties among
elements of the same group occurs because they have the same number of valence electrons. It is the loss, gain, or
sharing of valence electrons that defines how elements react.
It is important to remember that the periodic table was developed on the basis of the chemical behavior of the
elements, well before any idea of their atomic structure was available. Now we can understand why the periodic table
has the arrangement it has—the arrangement puts elements whose atoms have the same number of valence electrons
in the same group. This arrangement is emphasized in Figure 6.29, which shows in periodic-table form the electron
configuration of the last subshell to be filled by the Aufbau principle. The colored sections of Figure 6.29 show
the three categories of elements classified by the orbitals being filled: main group, transition, and inner transition
elements. These classifications determine which orbitals are counted in the valence shell, or highest energy level
orbitals of an atom.
1. Main group elements (sometimes called representative elements) are those in which the last electron added
enters an s or a p orbital in the outermost shell, shown in blue and red in Figure 6.29. This category includes
all the nonmetallic elements, as well as many metals and the metalloids. The valence electrons for main group
elements are those with the highest n level. For example, gallium (Ga, atomic number 31) has the electron
configuration [Ar]4s23d104p1, which contains three valence electrons (underlined). The completely filled d
orbitals count as core, not valence, electrons.
2. Transition elements or transition metals. These are metallic elements in which the last electron added
enters a d orbital. The valence electrons (those added after the last noble gas configuration) in these elements
include the ns and (n – 1) d electrons. The official IUPAC definition of transition elements specifies those with
partially filled d orbitals. Thus, the elements with completely filled orbitals (Zn, Cd, Hg, as well as Cu, Ag,
and Au in Figure 6.29) are not technically transition elements. However, the term is frequently used to refer
to the entire d block (colored yellow in Figure 6.29), and we will adopt this usage in this textbook.
3. Inner transition elements are metallic elements in which the last electron added occupies an f orbital. They
are shown in green in Figure 6.29. The valence shells of the inner transition elements consist of the (n – 2)f,
the (n – 1)d, and the ns subshells. There are two inner transition series:
a. The lanthanide series: lanthanide (La) through lutetium (Lu)
b. The actinide series: actinide (Ac) through lawrencium (Lr)
Lanthanum and actinium, because of their similarities to the other members of the series, are included and used to
name the series, even though they are transition metals with no f electrons.
Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 321
Electron Configurations of Ions
Ions are formed when atoms gain or lose electrons. A cation (positively charged ion) forms when one or more
electrons are removed from a parent atom. For main group elements, the electrons that were added last are the first
electrons removed. For transition metals and inner transition metals, however, electrons in the s orbital are easier to
remove than the d or f electrons, and so the highest ns electrons are lost, and then the (n – 1)d or (n – 2)f electrons
are removed. An anion (negatively charged ion) forms when one or more electrons are added to a parent atom. The
added electrons fill in the order predicted by the Aufbau principle.

(a) Na+

Solution
First, write out the electron configuration for each parent atom. We have chosen to show the full,
unabbreviated configurations to provide more practice for students who want it, but listing the core-
abbreviated electron configurations is also acceptable.
Next, determine whether an electron is gained or lost. Remember electrons are negatively charged, so ions
with a positive charge have lost an electron. For main group elements, the last orbital gains or loses the
electron. For transition metals, the last s orbital loses an electron before the d orbitals.
(a) Na: 1s22s22p63s1. Sodium cation loses one electron, so Na+: 1s22s22p63s1 = Na+: 1s22s22p6.
(b) P: 1s22s22p63s23p3. Phosphorus trianion gains three electrons, so P3−: 1s22s22p63s23p6.
(c) Al: 1s22s22p63s23p1. Aluminum dication loses two electrons Al2+: 1s22s22p63s23p1 =
Al2+: 1s22s22p63s1.
(d) Fe: 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d6. Iron(II) loses two electrons and, since it is a transition metal, they are
removed from the 4s orbital Fe2+: 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d6 = 1s22s22p63s23p63d6.
(e). Sm: 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d104p65s24d105p66s24f6. Samarium trication loses three electrons. The first
two will be lost from the 6s orbital, and the final one is removed from the 4f orbital. Sm3+:
1s22s22p63s23p64s23d104p65s24d105p66s24f6 = 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d104p65s24d105p64f5.

6.5 Periodic Variations in Element Properties
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe and explain the observed trends in atomic size, ionization energy, and electron affinity of the
elements
The elements in groups (vertical columns) of the periodic table exhibit similar chemical behavior. This similarity
occurs because the members of a group have the same number and distribution of electrons in their valence shells.
However, there are also other patterns in chemical properties on the periodic table. For example, as we move down
a group, the metallic character of the atoms increases. Oxygen, at the top of group 16 (6A), is a colorless gas; in the
middle of the group, selenium is a semiconducting solid; and, toward the bottom, polonium is a silver-grey solid that
conducts electricity.
As we go across a period from left to right, we add a proton to the nucleus and an electron to the valence shell with
each successive element. As we go down the elements in a group, the number of electrons in the valence shell remains
constant, but the principal quantum number increases by one each time. An understanding of the electronic structure
of the elements allows us to examine some of the properties that govern their chemical behavior. These properties
vary periodically as the electronic structure of the elements changes. They are (1) size (radius) of atoms and ions, (2)
ionization energies, and (3) electron affinities.
Explore visualizations (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16pertrends) of the periodic trends discussed in
this section (and many more trends). With just a few clicks, you can create three-dimensional versions of
the periodic table showing atomic size or graphs of ionization energies from all measured elements.
Variation in Covalent Radius
The quantum mechanical picture makes it difficult to establish a definite size of an atom. However, there are several
practical ways to define the radius of atoms and, thus, to determine their relative sizes that give roughly similar
values. We will use the covalent radius (Figure 6.30), which is defined as one-half the distance between the
nuclei of two identical atoms when they are joined by a covalent bond (this measurement is possible because atoms
within molecules still retain much of their atomic identity). We know that as we scan down a group, the principal
quantum number, n, increases by one for each element. Thus, the electrons are being added to a region of space that
is increasingly distant from the nucleus. Consequently, the size of the atom (and its covalent radius) must increase as
we increase the distance of the outermost electrons from the nucleus. This trend is illustrated for the covalent radii of
the halogens in Table 6.2 and Figure 6.30. The trends for the entire periodic table can be seen in Figure 6.30.

down a group and decrease across a period.

Figure 6.31 Within each period, the trend in atomic radius decreases as Z increases; for example, from K to Kr.
Within each group (e.g., the alkali metals shown in purple), the trend is that atomic radius increases as Z increases.
As shown in Figure 6.31, as we move across a period from left to right, we generally find that each element has
a smaller covalent radius than the element preceding it. This might seem counterintuitive because it implies that
atoms with more electrons have a smaller atomic radius. This can be explained with the concept of effective nuclear
charge, Zeff. This is the pull exerted on a specific electron by the nucleus, taking into account any electron–electron
repulsions. For hydrogen, there is only one electron and so the nuclear charge (Z) and the effective nuclear charge
(Zeff) are equal. For all other atoms, the inner electrons partially shield the outer electrons from the pull of the nucleus,
and thus:
Zeff = Z − shielding
Shielding is determined by the probability of another electron being between the electron of interest and the nucleus,
as well as by the electron–electron repulsions the electron of interest encounters. Core electrons are adept at shielding,
while electrons in the same valence shell do not block the nuclear attraction experienced by each other as efficiently.
Thus, each time we move from one element to the next across a period, Z increases by one, but the shielding increases
only slightly. Thus, Zeff increases as we move from left to right across a period. The stronger pull (higher effective
nuclear charge) experienced by electrons on the right side of the periodic table draws them closer to the nucleus,
making the covalent radii smaller.
Thus, as we would expect, the outermost or valence electrons are easiest to remove because they have the highest
energies, are shielded more, and are farthest from the nucleus. As a general rule, when the representative elements
form cations, they do so by the loss of the ns or np electrons that were added last in the Aufbau process. The transition
elements, on the other hand, lose the ns electrons before they begin to lose the (n – 1)d electrons, even though the ns
Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 325
electrons are added first, according to the Aufbau principle.
Example 6.12
Sorting Atomic Radii
Predict the order of increasing covalent radius for Ge, Fl, Br, Kr.
Solution
Radius increases as we move down a group, so Ge < Fl (Note: Fl is the symbol for flerovium, element 114,
NOT fluorine). Radius decreases as we move across a period, so Kr < Br < Ge. Putting the trends together,
we obtain Kr < Br < Ge < Fl.

Answer: Ne or He
Variation in Ionic Radii
Ionic radius is the measure used to describe the size of an ion. A cation always has fewer electrons and the same
number of protons as the parent atom; it is smaller than the atom from which it is derived (Figure 6.32). For example,
the covalent radius of an aluminum atom (1s22s22p63s23p1) is 118 pm, whereas the ionic radius of an Al3+ (1s22s22p6)
is 68 pm. As electrons are removed from the outer valence shell, the remaining core electrons occupying smaller
shells experience a greater effective nuclear charge Zeff (as discussed) and are drawn even closer to the nucleus.
Figure 6.32 The radius for a cation is smaller than the parent atom (Al), due to the lost electrons; the radius for an
anion is larger than the parent (S), due to the gained electrons.
Cations with larger charges are smaller than cations with smaller charges (e.g., V2+ has an ionic radius of 79 pm, while
that of V3+ is 64 pm). Proceeding down the groups of the periodic table, we find that cations of successive elements
with the same charge generally have larger radii, corresponding to an increase in the principal quantum number, n.
An anion (negative ion) is formed by the addition of one or more electrons to the valence shell of an atom. This results
in a greater repulsion among the electrons and a decrease in Zeff per electron. Both effects (the increased number of
electrons and the decreased Zeff) cause the radius of an anion to be larger than that of the parent atom (Figure 6.32).
For example, a sulfur atom ([Ne]3s23p4) has a covalent radius of 104 pm, whereas the ionic radius of the sulfide anion
([Ne]3s23p6) is 170 pm. For consecutive elements proceeding down any group, anions have larger principal quantum
numbers and, thus, larger radii.
Atoms and ions that have the same electron configuration are said to be isoelectronic. Examples of isoelectronic
species are N3–, O2–, F–, Ne, Na+, Mg2+, and Al3+ (1s22s22p6). Another isoelectronic series is P3–, S2–, Cl–, Ar, K+,
Ca2+, and Sc3+ ([Ne]3s23p6). For atoms or ions that are isoelectronic, the number of protons determines the size. The
greater the nuclear charge, the smaller the radius in a series of isoelectronic ions and atoms.
Variation in Ionization Energies
The amount of energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron from a gaseous atom in its ground state is
called its first ionization energy (IE1). The first ionization energy for an element, X, is the energy required to form a
cation with +1 charge:
326 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
X(g) ⟶ X+(g) + e− IE1
The energy required to remove the second most loosely bound electron is called the second ionization energy (IE2).
X+(g) ⟶ X2+(g) + e− IE2
The energy required to remove the third electron is the third ionization energy, and so on. Energy is always required to
remove electrons from atoms or ions, so ionization processes are endothermic and IE values are always positive. For
larger atoms, the most loosely bound electron is located farther from the nucleus and so is easier to remove. Thus, as
size (atomic radius) increases, the ionization energy should decrease. Relating this logic to what we have just learned
about radii, we would expect first ionization energies to decrease down a group and to increase across a period.
Figure 6.33 graphs the relationship between the first ionization energy and the atomic number of several elements.
The values of first ionization energy for the elements are given in Figure 6.34. Within a period, the IE1 generally
increases with increasing Z. Down a group, the IE1 value generally decreases with increasing Z. There are some
systematic deviations from this trend, however. Note that the ionization energy of boron (atomic number 5) is less
than that of beryllium (atomic number 4) even though the nuclear charge of boron is greater by one proton. This can be
explained because the energy of the subshells increases as l increases, due to penetration and shielding (as discussed
previously in this chapter). Within any one shell, the s electrons are lower in energy than the p electrons. This means
that an s electron is harder to remove from an atom than a p electron in the same shell. The electron removed during
the ionization of beryllium ([He]2s2) is an s electron, whereas the electron removed during the ionization of boron
([He]2s22p1) is a p electron; this results in a lower first ionization energy for boron, even though its nuclear charge
is greater by one proton. Thus, we see a small deviation from the predicted trend occurring each time a new subshell
begins.
Figure 6.33 The first ionization energy of the elements in the first five periods are plotted against their atomic
number.
Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 327
Figure 6.34 This version of the periodic table shows the first ionization energy (IE1), in kJ/mol, of selected elements.
Another deviation occurs as orbitals become more than one-half filled. The first ionization energy for oxygen is
slightly less than that for nitrogen, despite the trend in increasing IE1 values across a period. Looking at the orbital
diagram of oxygen, we can see that removing one electron will eliminate the electron–electron repulsion caused
by pairing the electrons in the 2p orbital and will result in a half-filled orbital (which is energetically favorable).
Analogous changes occur in succeeding periods (note the dip for sulfur after phosphorus in Figure 6.34).
Removing an electron from a cation is more difficult than removing an electron from a neutral atom because of the
greater electrostatic attraction to the cation. Likewise, removing an electron from a cation with a higher positive
charge is more difficult than removing an electron from an ion with a lower charge. Thus, successive ionization
energies for one element always increase. As seen in Table 6.3, there is a large increase in the ionization energies for
each element. This jump corresponds to removal of the core electrons, which are harder to remove than the valence
electrons. For example, Sc and Ga both have three valence electrons, so the rapid increase in ionization energy occurs
after the third ionization.

Solution
Removing the 6p1 electron from Tl is easier than removing the 3p1 electron from Al because the higher
n orbital is farther from the nucleus, so IE1(Tl) < IE1(Al). Ionizing the third electron from
Al (Al2+ ⟶ Al3+ + e−) requires more energy because the cation Al2+ exerts a stronger pull on the
electron than the neutral Al atom, so IE1(Al) < IE3(Al). The second ionization energy for sodium removes
a core electron, which is a much higher energy process than removing valence electrons. Putting this all
together, we obtain: IE1(Tl) < IE1(Al) < IE3(Al) < IE2(Na).

X(g) + e− ⟶ X−(g) EA1
This process can be either endothermic or exothermic, depending on the element. The EA of some of the elements is
given in Figure 6.35. You can see that many of these elements have negative values of EA, which means that energy
is released when the gaseous atom accepts an electron. However, for some elements, energy is required for the atom
to become negatively charged and the value of their EA is positive. Just as with ionization energy, subsequent EA
values are associated with forming ions with more charge. The second EA is the energy associated with adding an
electron to an anion to form a –2 ion, and so on.
As we might predict, it becomes easier to add an electron across a series of atoms as the effective nuclear charge of
the atoms increases. We find, as we go from left to right across a period, EAs tend to become more negative. The
exceptions found among the elements of group 2 (2A), group 15 (5A), and group 18 (8A) can be understood based
on the electronic structure of these groups. The noble gases, group 18 (8A), have a completely filled shell and the
incoming electron must be added to a higher n level, which is more difficult to do. Group 2 (2A) has a filled ns
subshell, and so the next electron added goes into the higher energy np, so, again, the observed EA value is not as the
trend would predict. Finally, group 15 (5A) has a half-filled np subshell and the next electron must be paired with an
existing np electron. In all of these cases, the initial relative stability of the electron configuration disrupts the trend
in EA.
We also might expect the atom at the top of each group to have the most negative EA; their first ionization potentials
suggest that these atoms have the largest effective nuclear charges. However, as we move down a group, we see that
the second element in the group most often has the most negative EA. This can be attributed to the small size of the
Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 329
n = 2 shell and the resulting large electron–electron repulsions. For example, chlorine, with an EA value of –348 kJ/
mol, has the highest value of any element in the periodic table. The EA of fluorine is –322 kJ/mol. When we add an
electron to a fluorine atom to form a fluoride anion (F–), we add an electron to the n = 2 shell. The electron is attracted
to the nucleus, but there is also significant repulsion from the other electrons already present in this small valence
shell. The chlorine atom has the same electron configuration in the valence shell, but because the entering electron
is going into the n = 3 shell, it occupies a considerably larger region of space and the electron–electron repulsions
are reduced. The entering electron does not experience as much repulsion and the chlorine atom accepts an additional
electron more readily, resulting in a more negative EA.
Figure 6.35 This version of the periodic table displays the electron affinity values (in kJ/mol) for selected elements.
The properties discussed in this section (size of atoms and ions, effective nuclear charge, ionization energies, and
electron affinities) are central to understanding chemical reactivity. For example, because fluorine has an energetically
favorable EA and a large energy barrier to ionization (IE), it is much easier to form fluorine anions than cations.
Metallic properties including conductivity and malleability (the ability to be formed into sheets) depend on having
electrons that can be removed easily. Thus, metallic character increases as we move down a group and decreases
across a period in the same trend observed for atomic size because it is easier to remove an electron that is farther
away from the nucleus.

Summary
6.1 Electromagnetic Energy
Light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, c, of 2.998 ×
108 m s−1. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, ν, and a wavelength,
λ, such that c = λν. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing
waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited
to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely
spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that
is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates
properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the
wavelength) of the radiation as E = hν (or E = hc
λ ), where h is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both
wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share
these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact
differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by
exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent
sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions
that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen
can be obtained by passing the light from an electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum
was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three
historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within
the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the
Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements 333
photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum
theories that superseded the classical theories.
6.2 The Bohr Model
Bohr incorporated Planck’s and Einstein’s quantization ideas into a model of the hydrogen atom that resolved the
paradox of atom stability and discrete spectra. The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom explains the connection between
the quantization of photons and the quantized emission from atoms. Bohr described the hydrogen atom in terms of
an electron moving in a circular orbit about a nucleus. He postulated that the electron was restricted to certain orbits
characterized by discrete energies. Transitions between these allowed orbits result in the absorption or emission of
photons. When an electron moves from a higher-energy orbit to a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of a
photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to a more excited one, a photon of energy must be absorbed. Using
the Bohr model, we can calculate the energy of an electron and the radius of its orbit in any one-electron system.
6.3 Development of Quantum Theory
Macroscopic objects act as particles. Microscopic objects (such as electrons) have properties of both a particle
and a wave. Their exact trajectories cannot be determined. The quantum mechanical model of atoms describes the
three-dimensional position of the electron in a probabilistic manner according to a mathematical function called
a wavefunction, often denoted as ψ. Atomic wavefunctions are also called orbitals. The squared magnitude of the
wavefunction describes the distribution of the probability of finding the electron in a particular region in space.
Therefore, atomic orbitals describe the areas in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found.
An atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum numbers. The principal quantum number, n, can be any positive
integer. The general region for value of energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the
nucleus are related to n. Orbitals having the same value of n are said to be in the same shell. The secondary (angular
momentum) quantum number, l, can have any integer value from 0 to n – 1. This quantum number describes the
shape or type of the orbital. Orbitals with the same principal quantum number and the same l value belong to the same
subshell. The magnetic quantum number, ml, with 2l + 1 values ranging from –l to +l, describes the orientation of the
orbital in space. In addition, each electron has a spin quantum number, ms, that can be equal to ± 1
2. No two electrons
in the same atom can have the same set of values for all the four quantum numbers.
6.4 Electronic Structure of Atoms (Electron Configurations)
The relative energy of the subshells determine the order in which atomic orbitals are filled (1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s,
3d, 4p, and so on). Electron configurations and orbital diagrams can be determined by applying the Pauli exclusion
principle (no two electrons can have the same set of four quantum numbers) and Hund’s rule (whenever possible,
electrons retain unpaired spins in degenerate orbitals).
Electrons in the outermost orbitals, called valence electrons, are responsible for most of the chemical behavior of
elements. In the periodic table, elements with analogous valence electron configurations usually occur within the
same group. There are some exceptions to the predicted filling order, particularly when half-filled or completely filled
orbitals can be formed. The periodic table can be divided into three categories based on the orbital in which the last
electron to be added is placed: main group elements (s and p orbitals), transition elements (d orbitals), and inner
transition elements (f orbitals).
6.5 Periodic Variations in Element Properties
Electron configurations allow us to understand many periodic trends. Covalent radius increases as we move down a
group because the n level (orbital size) increases. Covalent radius mostly decreases as we move left to right across
a period because the effective nuclear charge experienced by the electrons increases, and the electrons are pulled
in tighter to the nucleus. Anionic radii are larger than the parent atom, while cationic radii are smaller, because the
number of valence electrons has changed while the nuclear charge has remained constant. Ionization energy (the
energy associated with forming a cation) decreases down a group and mostly increases across a period because it
is easier to remove an electron from a larger, higher energy orbital. Electron affinity (the energy associated with
334 Chapter 6 | Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties of Elements
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
forming an anion) is more favorable (exothermic) when electrons are placed into lower energy orbitals, closer to the
nucleus. Therefore, electron affinity becomes increasingly negative as we move left to right across the periodic table
and decreases as we move down a group. For both IE and electron affinity data, there are exceptions to the trends
when dealing with completely filled or half-filled subshells.

Introduction
It has long been known that pure carbon occurs in different forms (allotropes) including graphite and diamonds. But it
was not until 1985 that a new form of carbon was recognized: buckminsterfullerene. This molecule was named after
the architect and inventor R. Buckminster Fuller (1895–1983), whose signature architectural design was the geodesic
dome, characterized by a lattice shell structure supporting a spherical surface. Experimental evidence revealed the
formula, C60, and then scientists determined how 60 carbon atoms could form one symmetric, stable molecule. They
were guided by bonding theory—the topic of this chapter—which explains how individual atoms connect to form
more complex structures.
Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 343
7.1 Ionic Bonding
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the formation of cations, anions, and ionic compounds
• Predict the charge of common metallic and nonmetallic elements, and write their electron configurations
As you have learned, ions are atoms or molecules bearing an electrical charge. A cation (a positive ion) forms when
a neutral atom loses one or more electrons from its valence shell, and an anion (a negative ion) forms when a neutral
atom gains one or more electrons in its valence shell.
Compounds composed of ions are called ionic compounds (or salts), and their constituent ions are held together by
ionic bonds: electrostatic forces of attraction between oppositely charged cations and anions. The properties of ionic
compounds shed some light on the nature of ionic bonds. Ionic solids exhibit a crystalline structure and tend to be
rigid and brittle; they also tend to have high melting and boiling points, which suggests that ionic bonds are very
strong. Ionic solids are also poor conductors of electricity for the same reason—the strength of ionic bonds prevents
ions from moving freely in the solid state. Most ionic solids, however, dissolve readily in water. Once dissolved or
melted, ionic compounds are excellent conductors of electricity and heat because the ions can move about freely.
Neutral atoms and their associated ions have very different physical and chemical properties. Sodium atoms form
sodium metal, a soft, silvery-white metal that burns vigorously in air and reacts explosively with water. Chlorine
atoms form chlorine gas, Cl2, a yellow-green gas that is extremely corrosive to most metals and very poisonous to
animals and plants. The vigorous reaction between the elements sodium and chlorine forms the white, crystalline
compound sodium chloride, common table salt, which contains sodium cations and chloride anions (Figure 7.2).
The compound composed of these ions exhibits properties entirely different from the properties of the elements
sodium and chlorine. Chlorine is poisonous, but sodium chloride is essential to life; sodium atoms react vigorously
with water, but sodium chloride simply dissolves in water.
Figure 7.2 (a) Sodium is a soft metal that must be stored in mineral oil to prevent reaction with air or water. (b)
Chlorine is a pale yellow-green gas. (c) When combined, they form white crystals of sodium chloride (table salt).

The Formation of Ionic Compounds
Binary ionic compounds are composed of just two elements: a metal (which forms the cations) and a nonmetal
(which forms the anions). For example, NaCl is a binary ionic compound. We can think about the formation of such
compounds in terms of the periodic properties of the elements. Many metallic elements have relatively low ionization
potentials and lose electrons easily. These elements lie to the left in a period or near the bottom of a group on the
periodic table. Nonmetal atoms have relatively high electron affinities and thus readily gain electrons lost by metal
atoms, thereby filling their valence shells. Nonmetallic elements are found in the upper-right corner of the periodic
table.

As all substances must be electrically neutral, the total number of positive charges on the cations of an ionic
compound must equal the total number of negative charges on its anions. The formula of an ionic compound
represents the simplest ratio of the numbers of ions necessary to give identical numbers of positive and negative
charges. For example, the formula for aluminum oxide, Al2O3, indicates that this ionic compound contains two
aluminum cations, Al3+, for every three oxide anions, O2− [thus, (2 × +3) + (3 × –2) = 0].
It is important to note, however, that the formula for an ionic compound does not represent the physical arrangement
of its ions. It is incorrect to refer to a sodium chloride (NaCl) “molecule” because there is not a single ionic bond, per
se, between any specific pair of sodium and chloride ions. The attractive forces between ions are isotropic—the same
in all directions—meaning that any particular ion is equally attracted to all of the nearby ions of opposite charge. This
results in the ions arranging themselves into a tightly bound, three-dimensional lattice structure. Sodium chloride, for
example, consists of a regular arrangement of equal numbers of Na+ cations and Cl– anions (Figure 7.3).
Figure 7.3 The atoms in sodium chloride (common table salt) are arranged to (a) maximize opposite charges
interacting. The smaller spheres represent sodium ions, the larger ones represent chloride ions. In the expanded view
(b), the geometry can be seen more clearly. Note that each ion is “bonded” to all of the surrounding ions—six in this
case.
The strong electrostatic attraction between Na+ and Cl– ions holds them tightly together in solid NaCl. It requires 769
kJ of energy to dissociate one mole of solid NaCl into separate gaseous Na+ and Cl– ions:
NaCl(s) ⟶ Na+(g) + Cl–(g) ΔH = 769 kJ
Electronic Structures of Cations
When forming a cation, an atom of a main group element tends to lose all of its valence electrons, thus assuming
the electronic structure of the noble gas that precedes it in the periodic table. For groups 1 (the alkali metals) and 2
(the alkaline earth metals), the group numbers are equal to the numbers of valence shell electrons and, consequently,
to the charges of the cations formed from atoms of these elements when all valence shell electrons are removed.
For example, calcium is a group 2 element whose neutral atoms have 20 electrons and a ground state electron
configuration of 1s22s22p63s23p64s2. When a Ca atom loses both of its valence electrons, the result is a cation with
18 electrons, a 2+ charge, and an electron configuration of 1s22s22p63s23p6. The Ca2+ ion is therefore isoelectronic
with the noble gas Ar.
For groups 13–17, the group numbers exceed the number of valence electrons by 10 (accounting for the possibility
of full d subshells in atoms of elements in the fourth and greater periods). Thus, the charge of a cation formed by the
loss of all valence electrons is equal to the group number minus 10. For example, aluminum (in group 13) forms 3+
ions (Al3+).
Exceptions to the expected behavior involve elements toward the bottom of the groups. In addition to the expected
ions Tl3+, Sn4+, Pb4+, and Bi5+, a partial loss of these atoms’ valence shell electrons can also lead to the formation
Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 345
of Tl+, Sn2+, Pb2+, and Bi3+ ions. The formation of these 1+, 2+, and 3+ cations is ascribed to the inert pair effect,
which reflects the relatively low energy of the valence s-electron pair for atoms of the heavy elements of groups 13,
14, and 15. Mercury (group 12) also exhibits an unexpected behavior: it forms a diatomic ion, Hg2 2+ (an ion formed
from two mercury atoms, with an Hg-Hg bond), in addition to the expected monatomic ion Hg2+ (formed from only
one mercury atom).
Transition and inner transition metal elements behave differently than main group elements. Most transition metal
cations have 2+ or 3+ charges that result from the loss of their outermost s electron(s) first, sometimes followed by
the loss of one or two d electrons from the next-to-outermost shell. For example, iron (1s22s22p63s23p63d64s2) forms
the ion Fe2+ (1s22s22p63s23p63d6) by the loss of the 4s electron and the ion Fe3+ (1s22s22p63s23p63d5) by the loss of
the 4s electron and one of the 3d electrons. Although the d orbitals of the transition elements are—according to the
Aufbau principle—the last to fill when building up electron configurations, the outermost s electrons are the first to
be lost when these atoms ionize. When the inner transition metals form ions, they usually have a 3+ charge, resulting
from the loss of their outermost s electrons and a d or f electron.
Example 7.1
Determining the Electronic Structures of Cations
There are at least 14 elements categorized as “essential trace elements” for the human body. They are called
“essential” because they are required for healthy bodily functions, “trace” because they are required only
in small amounts, and “elements” in spite of the fact that they are really ions. Two of these essential trace
elements, chromium and zinc, are required as Cr3+ and Zn2+. Write the electron configurations of these
cations.
Solution
First, write the electron configuration for the neutral atoms:
Zn: [Ar]3d104s2
Cr: [Ar]3d54s1
Next, remove electrons from the highest energy orbital. For the transition metals, electrons are removed
from the s orbital first and then from the d orbital. For the p-block elements, electrons are removed from
the p orbitals and then from the s orbital. Zinc is a member of group 12, so it should have a charge of 2+,
and thus loses only the two electrons in its s orbital. Chromium is a transition element and should lose its s
electrons and then its d electrons when forming a cation. Thus, we find the following electron configurations
of the ions:
Zn2+: [Ar]3d10
Cr3+: [Ar]3d3

Answer: K+: [Ar], Mg2+: [Ne]
Electronic Structures of Anions
Most monatomic anions form when a neutral nonmetal atom gains enough electrons to completely fill its outer s and
p orbitals, thereby reaching the electron configuration of the next noble gas. Thus, it is simple to determine the charge
on such a negative ion: The charge is equal to the number of electrons that must be gained to fill the s and p orbitals
of the parent atom. Oxygen, for example, has the electron configuration 1s22s22p4, whereas the oxygen anion has the
electron configuration of the noble gas neon (Ne), 1s22s22p6. The two additional electrons required to fill the valence

orbitals give the oxide ion the charge of 2– (O2–).

7.2 Covalent Bonding
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the formation of covalent bonds
• Define electronegativity and assess the polarity of covalent bonds
Ionic bonding results from the electrostatic attraction of oppositely charged ions that are typically produced by the
transfer of electrons between metallic and nonmetallic atoms. A different type of bonding results from the mutual
attraction of atoms for a “shared” pair of electrons. Such bonds are called covalent bonds. Covalent bonds are formed
between two atoms when both have similar tendencies to attract electrons to themselves (i.e., when both atoms
have identical or fairly similar ionization energies and electron affinities). For example, two hydrogen atoms bond
covalently to form an H2 molecule; each hydrogen atom in the H2 molecule has two electrons stabilizing it, giving
each atom the same number of valence electrons as the noble gas He.
Compounds that contain covalent bonds exhibit different physical properties than ionic compounds. Because the
attraction between molecules, which are electrically neutral, is weaker than that between electrically charged ions,
covalent compounds generally have much lower melting and boiling points than ionic compounds. In fact, many
covalent compounds are liquids or gases at room temperature, and, in their solid states, they are typically much
softer than ionic solids. Furthermore, whereas ionic compounds are good conductors of electricity when dissolved in
water, most covalent compounds are insoluble in water; since they are electrically neutral, they are poor conductors
of electricity in any state.
Formation of Covalent Bonds
Nonmetal atoms frequently form covalent bonds with other nonmetal atoms. For example, the hydrogen molecule, H2,
contains a covalent bond between its two hydrogen atoms. Figure 7.4 illustrates why this bond is formed. Starting on
the far right, we have two separate hydrogen atoms with a particular potential energy, indicated by the red line. Along
the x-axis is the distance between the two atoms. As the two atoms approach each other (moving left along the x-axis),
their valence orbitals (1s) begin to overlap. The single electrons on each hydrogen atom then interact with both atomic
nuclei, occupying the space around both atoms. The strong attraction of each shared electron to both nuclei stabilizes
the system, and the potential energy decreases as the bond distance decreases. If the atoms continue to approach each
other, the positive charges in the two nuclei begin to repel each other, and the potential energy increases. The bond
length is determined by the distance at which the lowest potential energy is achieved.
Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 347
Figure 7.4 The potential energy of two separate hydrogen atoms (right) decreases as they approach each other,
and the single electrons on each atom are shared to form a covalent bond. The bond length is the internuclear
distance at which the lowest potential energy is achieved.
It is essential to remember that energy must be added to break chemical bonds (an endothermic process), whereas
forming chemical bonds releases energy (an exothermic process). In the case of H2, the covalent bond is very strong;
a large amount of energy, 436 kJ, must be added to break the bonds in one mole of hydrogen molecules and cause the
atoms to separate:
H2(g) ⟶ 2H(g) ΔH = 436 kJ
Conversely, the same amount of energy is released when one mole of H2 molecules forms from two moles of H atoms:
2H(g) ⟶ H2(g) ΔH = −436 kJ

Pure vs. Polar Covalent Bonds
If the atoms that form a covalent bond are identical, as in H2, Cl2, and other diatomic molecules, then the electrons in
the bond must be shared equally. We refer to this as a pure covalent bond. Electrons shared in pure covalent bonds
have an equal probability of being near each nucleus.
In the case of Cl2, each atom starts off with seven valence electrons, and each Cl shares one electron with the other,
forming one covalent bond:
Cl + Cl ⟶ Cl2
The total number of electrons around each individual atom consists of six nonbonding electrons and two shared (i.e.,
bonding) electrons for eight total electrons, matching the number of valence electrons in the noble gas argon. Since
the bonding atoms are identical, Cl2 also features a pure covalent bond.
When the atoms linked by a covalent bond are different, the bonding electrons are shared, but no longer equally.
Instead, the bonding electrons are more attracted to one atom than the other, giving rise to a shift of electron density
toward that atom. This unequal distribution of electrons is known as a polar covalent bond, characterized by a
partial positive charge on one atom and a partial negative charge on the other. The atom that attracts the electrons
more strongly acquires the partial negative charge and vice versa. For example, the electrons in the H–Cl bond of a
hydrogen chloride molecule spend more time near the chlorine atom than near the hydrogen atom. Thus, in an HCl
molecule, the chlorine atom carries a partial negative charge and the hydrogen atom has a partial positive charge.
Figure 7.5 shows the distribution of electrons in the H–Cl bond. Note that the shaded area around Cl is much larger
than it is around H. Compare this to Figure 7.4, which shows the even distribution of electrons in the H2 nonpolar
bond.
We sometimes designate the positive and negative atoms in a polar covalent bond using a lowercase Greek letter
“delta,” δ, with a plus sign or minus sign to indicate whether the atom has a partial positive charge (δ+) or a partial
negative charge (δ–). This symbolism is shown for the H–Cl molecule in Figure 7.5.
Figure 7.5 (a) The distribution of electron density in the HCl molecule is uneven. The electron density is greater
around the chlorine nucleus. The small, black dots indicate the location of the hydrogen and chlorine nuclei in the
molecule. (b) Symbols δ+ and δ– indicate the polarity of the H–Cl bond.
Electronegativity
Whether a bond is nonpolar or polar covalent is determined by a property of the bonding atoms called
electronegativity. Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract electrons (or electron density)
towards itself. It determines how the shared electrons are distributed between the two atoms in a bond. The more
strongly an atom attracts the electrons in its bonds, the larger its electronegativity. Electrons in a polar covalent bond
are shifted toward the more electronegative atom; thus, the more electronegative atom is the one with the partial
negative charge. The greater the difference in electronegativity, the more polarized the electron distribution and the
larger the partial charges of the atoms.
Figure 7.6 shows the electronegativity values of the elements as proposed by one of the most famous chemists of
the twentieth century: Linus Pauling (Figure 7.7). In general, electronegativity increases from left to right across a
period in the periodic table and decreases down a group. Thus, the nonmetals, which lie in the upper right, tend to
have the highest electronegativities, with fluorine the most electronegative element of all (EN = 4.0). Metals tend to
Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 349
be less electronegative elements, and the group 1 metals have the lowest electronegativities. Note that noble gases are
excluded from this figure because these atoms usually do not share electrons with others atoms since they have a full
valence shell. (While noble gas compounds such as XeO2 do exist, they can only be formed under extreme conditions,
and thus they do not fit neatly into the general model of electronegativity.)
Figure 7.6 The electronegativity values derived by Pauling follow predictable periodic trends, with the higher
electronegativities toward the upper right of the periodic table.
Electronegativity versus Electron Affinity
We must be careful not to confuse electronegativity and electron affinity. The electron affinity of an element is a
measurable physical quantity, namely, the energy released or absorbed when an isolated gas-phase atom acquires an
electron, measured in kJ/mol. Electronegativity, on the other hand, describes how tightly an atom attracts electrons
in a bond. It is a dimensionless quantity that is calculated, not measured. Pauling derived the first electronegativity
values by comparing the amounts of energy required to break different types of bonds. He chose an arbitrary relative
scale ranging from 0 to 4.
Linus Pauling
Linus Pauling, shown in Figure 7.7, is the only person to have received two unshared (individual) Nobel
Prizes: one for chemistry in 1954 for his work on the nature of chemical bonds and one for peace in 1962
for his opposition to weapons of mass destruction. He developed many of the theories and concepts that are
foundational to our current understanding of chemistry, including electronegativity and resonance structures.

Figure 7.7 Linus Pauling (1901–1994) made many important contributions to the field of chemistry. He was
also a prominent activist, publicizing issues related to health and nuclear weapons.
Pauling also contributed to many other fields besides chemistry. His research on sickle cell anemia revealed
the cause of the disease—the presence of a genetically inherited abnormal protein in the blood—and paved
the way for the field of molecular genetics. His work was also pivotal in curbing the testing of nuclear weapons;
he proved that radioactive fallout from nuclear testing posed a public health risk.
Electronegativity and Bond Type
The absolute value of the difference in electronegativity (ΔEN) of two bonded atoms provides a rough measure
of the polarity to be expected in the bond and, thus, the bond type. When the difference is very small or zero,
the bond is covalent and nonpolar. When it is large, the bond is polar covalent or ionic. The absolute values of
the electronegativity differences between the atoms in the bonds H–H, H–Cl, and Na–Cl are 0 (nonpolar), 0.9
(polar covalent), and 2.1 (ionic), respectively. The degree to which electrons are shared between atoms varies from
completely equal (pure covalent bonding) to not at all (ionic bonding). Figure 7.8 shows the relationship between
electronegativity difference and bond type.
Figure 7.8 As the electronegativity difference increases between two atoms, the bond becomes more ionic.
A rough approximation of the electronegativity differences associated with covalent, polar covalent, and ionic bonds
is shown in Figure 7.8. This table is just a general guide, however, with many exceptions. For example, the H and
Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 351
F atoms in HF have an electronegativity difference of 1.9, and the N and H atoms in NH3 a difference of 0.9, yet
both of these compounds form bonds that are considered polar covalent. Likewise, the Na and Cl atoms in NaCl have
an electronegativity difference of 2.1, and the Mn and I atoms in MnI2 have a difference of 1.0, yet both of these
substances form ionic compounds.
The best guide to the covalent or ionic character of a bond is to consider the types of atoms involved and their relative
positions in the periodic table. Bonds between two nonmetals are generally covalent; bonding between a metal and a
nonmetal is often ionic.
Some compounds contain both covalent and ionic bonds. The atoms in polyatomic ions, such as OH–, NO3 −,
and NH4 +, are held together by polar covalent bonds. However, these polyatomic ions form ionic compounds
by combining with ions of opposite charge. For example, potassium nitrate, KNO3, contains the K+ cation and the
polyatomic NO3 − anion. Thus, bonding in potassium nitrate is ionic, resulting from the electrostatic attraction
between the ions K+ and NO3 −, as well as covalent between the nitrogen and oxygen atoms in NO3 −.

Electronegativity and Bond Polarity
Bond polarities play an important role in determining the structure of proteins. Using the electronegativity

of increasing polarity. Then designate the positive and negative atoms using the symbols δ+ and δ–:
C–H, C–N, C–O, N–H, O–H, S–H
Solution
The polarity of these bonds increases as the absolute value of the electronegativity difference increases. The
atom with the δ– designation is the more electronegative of the two. Table 7.1 shows these bonds in order
of increasing polarity.

7.3 Lewis Symbols and Structures
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Write Lewis symbols for neutral atoms and ions
• Draw Lewis structures depicting the bonding in simple molecules
Thus far in this chapter, we have discussed the various types of bonds that form between atoms and/or ions. In all
cases, these bonds involve the sharing or transfer of valence shell electrons between atoms. In this section, we will
explore the typical method for depicting valence shell electrons and chemical bonds, namely Lewis symbols and
Lewis structures.
Lewis Symbols
We use Lewis symbols to describe valence electron configurations of atoms and monatomic ions. A Lewis symbol
consists of an elemental symbol surrounded by one dot for each of its valence electrons:
Figure 7.9 shows the Lewis symbols for the elements of the third period of the periodic table.
Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 353
Figure 7.9 Lewis symbols illustrating the number of valence electrons for each element in the third period of the
periodic table.
Lewis symbols can also be used to illustrate the formation of cations from atoms, as shown here for sodium and
calcium:
Likewise, they can be used to show the formation of anions from atoms, as shown here for chlorine and sulfur:
Figure 7.10 demonstrates the use of Lewis symbols to show the transfer of electrons during the formation of ionic
compounds.

Figure 7.10 Cations are formed when atoms lose electrons, represented by fewer Lewis dots, whereas anions are
formed by atoms gaining electrons. The total number of electrons does not change.
Lewis Structures
We also use Lewis symbols to indicate the formation of covalent bonds, which are shown in Lewis structures,
drawings that describe the bonding in molecules and polyatomic ions. For example, when two chlorine atoms form a
chlorine molecule, they share one pair of electrons:
The Lewis structure indicates that each Cl atom has three pairs of electrons that are not used in bonding (called lone
pairs) and one shared pair of electrons (written between the atoms). A dash (or line) is sometimes used to indicate a
shared pair of electrons:
A single shared pair of electrons is called a single bond. Each Cl atom interacts with eight valence electrons: the six
in the lone pairs and the two in the single bond.
The Octet Rule
The other halogen molecules (F2, Br2, I2, and At2) form bonds like those in the chlorine molecule: one single bond
between atoms and three lone pairs of electrons per atom. This allows each halogen atom to have a noble gas electron
configuration. The tendency of main group atoms to form enough bonds to obtain eight valence electrons is known as
the octet rule.
The number of bonds that an atom can form can often be predicted from the number of electrons needed to reach an
octet (eight valence electrons); this is especially true of the nonmetals of the second period of the periodic table (C,
N, O, and F). For example, each atom of a group 14 element has four electrons in its outermost shell and therefore
requires four more electrons to reach an octet. These four electrons can be gained by forming four covalent bonds, as
Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 355
illustrated here for carbon in CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride) and silicon in SiH4 (silane). Because hydrogen only needs
two electrons to fill its valence shell, it is an exception to the octet rule. The transition elements and inner transition
elements also do not follow the octet rule:
Group 15 elements such as nitrogen have five valence electrons in the atomic Lewis symbol: one lone pair and three
unpaired electrons. To obtain an octet, these atoms form three covalent bonds, as in NH3 (ammonia). Oxygen and
other atoms in group 16 obtain an octet by forming two covalent bonds:
Double and Triple Bonds
As previously mentioned, when a pair of atoms shares one pair of electrons, we call this a single bond. However, a
pair of atoms may need to share more than one pair of electrons in order to achieve the requisite octet. A double bond
forms when two pairs of electrons are shared between a pair of atoms, as between the carbon and oxygen atoms in
CH2O (formaldehyde) and between the two carbon atoms in C2H4 (ethylene):
A triple bond forms when three electron pairs are shared by a pair of atoms, as in carbon monoxide (CO) and the
cyanide ion (CN–):
Writing Lewis Structures with the Octet Rule
For very simple molecules and molecular ions, we can write the Lewis structures by merely pairing up the unpaired
electrons on the constituent atoms. See these examples:
For more complicated molecules and molecular ions, it is helpful to follow the step-by-step procedure outlined here:
1. Determine the total number of valence (outer shell) electrons. For cations, subtract one electron for each
356 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry

positive charge. For anions, add one electron for each negative charge.
2. Draw a skeleton structure of the molecule or ion, arranging the atoms around a central atom. (Generally, the
least electronegative element should be placed in the center.) Connect each atom to the central atom with a
single bond (one electron pair).
3. Distribute the remaining electrons as lone pairs on the terminal atoms (except hydrogen), completing an octet
around each atom.
4. Place all remaining electrons on the central atom.
5. Rearrange the electrons of the outer atoms to make multiple bonds with the central atom in order to obtain
octets wherever possible.
Let us determine the Lewis structures of SiH4, CHO2 −, NO+, and OF2 as examples in following this procedure:
1. Determine the total number of valence (outer shell) electrons in the molecule or ion.
• For a molecule, we add the number of valence electrons on each atom in the molecule:
SiH4
Si: 4 valence electrons/atom × 1 atom = 4
+ H: 1 valence electron/atom × 4 atoms = 4
= 8 valence electrons
• For a negative ion, such as CHO2 −, we add the number of valence electrons on the atoms to the
number of negative charges on the ion (one electron is gained for each single negative charge):
CHO2 −
C: 4 valence electrons/atom × 1 atom = 4
H: 1 valence electron/atom × 1 atom = 1
O: 6 valence electrons/atom × 2 atoms = 12
+ 1 additional electron = 1
= 18 valence electrons
• For a positive ion, such as NO+, we add the number of valence electrons on the atoms in the ion and
then subtract the number of positive charges on the ion (one electron is lost for each single positive
charge) from the total number of valence electrons:
NO+
N: 5 valence electrons/atom × 1 atom = 5
O: 6 valence electron/atom × 1 atom = 6
+ −1 electron (positive charge) = −1
= 10 valence electrons
• Since OF2 is a neutral molecule, we simply add the number of valence electrons:
OF2
O: 6 valence electrons/atom × 1 atom = 6
+ F: 7 valence electrons/atom × 2 atoms = 14
= 20 valence electrons
2. Draw a skeleton structure of the molecule or ion, arranging the atoms around a central atom and connecting
each atom to the central atom with a single (one electron pair) bond. (Note that we denote ions with brackets
around the structure, indicating the charge outside the brackets:)
Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 357
When several arrangements of atoms are possible, as for CHO2 −, we must use experimental evidence to
choose the correct one. In general, the less electronegative elements are more likely to be central atoms. In
CHO2 −, the less electronegative carbon atom occupies the central position with the oxygen and hydrogen
atoms surrounding it. Other examples include P in POCl3, S in SO2, and Cl in ClO4 −. An exception is that
hydrogen is almost never a central atom. As the most electronegative element, fluorine also cannot be a central
atom.
3. Distribute the remaining electrons as lone pairs on the terminal atoms (except hydrogen) to complete their
valence shells with an octet of electrons.
• There are no remaining electrons on SiH4, so it is unchanged:
4. Place all remaining electrons on the central atom.
• For SiH4, CHO2 −, and NO+, there are no remaining electrons; we already placed all of the electrons
determined in Step 1.
• For OF2, we had 16 electrons remaining in Step 3, and we placed 12, leaving 4 to be placed on the
central atom:
5. Rearrange the electrons of the outer atoms to make multiple bonds with the central atom in order to obtain
octets wherever possible.
• SiH4: Si already has an octet, so nothing needs to be done.
• CHO2 − : We have distributed the valence electrons as lone pairs on the oxygen atoms, but the carbon
atom lacks an octet:
• NO+: For this ion, we added eight valence electrons, but neither atom has an octet. We cannot add any
more electrons since we have already used the total that we found in Step 1, so we must move electrons
to form a multiple bond:
This still does not produce an octet, so we must move another pair, forming a triple bond:
• In OF2, each atom has an octet as drawn, so nothing changes.

NASA’s Cassini-Huygens mission detected a large cloud of toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN) on Titan, one of
Saturn’s moons. Titan also contains ethane (H3CCH3), acetylene (HCCH), and ammonia (NH3). What are
the Lewis structures of these molecules?
Solution
Step 1. Calculate the number of valence electrons.
HCN: (1 × 1) + (4 × 1) + (5 × 1) = 10
H3CCH3: (1 × 3) + (2 × 4) + (1 × 3) = 14
HCCH: (1 × 1) + (2 × 4) + (1 × 1) = 10
NH3: (5 × 1) + (3 × 1) = 8
Step 2. Draw a skeleton and connect the atoms with single bonds. Remember that H is never a
central atom:
Step 3. Where needed, distribute electrons to the terminal atoms:
HCN: six electrons placed on N
H3CCH3: no electrons remain
HCCH: no terminal atoms capable of accepting electrons
NH3: no terminal atoms capable of accepting electrons
Step 4. Where needed, place remaining electrons on the central atom:
HCN: no electrons remain
H3CCH3: no electrons remain
HCCH: four electrons placed on carbon
NH3: two electrons placed on nitrogen
Step 5. Where needed, rearrange electrons to form multiple bonds in order to obtain an octet on
each atom:
HCN: form two more C–N bonds
H3CCH3: all atoms have the correct number of electrons
HCCH: form a triple bond between the two carbon atoms
NH3: all atoms have the correct number of electrons

Fullerene Chemistry
Carbon soot has been known to man since prehistoric times, but it was not until fairly recently that the
molecular structure of the main component of soot was discovered. In 1996, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was
awarded to Richard Smalley (Figure 7.11), Robert Curl, and Harold Kroto for their work in discovering a new
form of carbon, the C60 buckminsterfullerene molecule (Figure 7.1). An entire class of compounds, including
spheres and tubes of various shapes, were discovered based on C60. This type of molecule, called a fullerene,
shows promise in a variety of applications. Because of their size and shape, fullerenes can encapsulate
other molecules, so they have shown potential in various applications from hydrogen storage to targeted drug
delivery systems. They also possess unique electronic and optical properties that have been put to good use
in solar powered devices and chemical sensors.
Figure 7.11 Richard Smalley (1943–2005), a professor of physics, chemistry, and astronomy at Rice

Exceptions to the Octet Rule
Many covalent molecules have central atoms that do not have eight electrons in their Lewis structures. These
molecules fall into three categories:
• Odd-electron molecules have an odd number of valence electrons, and therefore have an unpaired electron.
• Electron-deficient molecules have a central atom that has fewer electrons than needed for a noble gas
configuration.
• Hypervalent molecules have a central atom that has more electrons than needed for a noble gas configuration.
Odd-electron Molecules
We call molecules that contain an odd number of electrons free radicals. Nitric oxide, NO, is an example of an odd-
electron molecule; it is produced in internal combustion engines when oxygen and nitrogen react at high temperatures.
To draw the Lewis structure for an odd-electron molecule like NO, we follow the same five steps we would for other
molecules, but with a few minor changes:
1. Determine the total number of valence (outer shell) electrons. The sum of the valence electrons is 5 (from N)
+ 6 (from O) = 11. The odd number immediately tells us that we have a free radical, so we know that not every
atom can have eight electrons in its valence shell.
2. Draw a skeleton structure of the molecule. We can easily draw a skeleton with an N–O single bond:
N–O
3. Distribute the remaining electrons as lone pairs on the terminal atoms. In this case, there is no central atom,
so we distribute the electrons around both atoms. We give eight electrons to the more electronegative atom in
these situations; thus oxygen has the filled valence shell:
4. Place all remaining electrons on the central atom. Since there are no remaining electrons, this step does not
apply.
5. Rearrange the electrons to make multiple bonds with the central atom in order to obtain octets wherever
possible. We know that an odd-electron molecule cannot have an octet for every atom, but we want to get each
atom as close to an octet as possible. In this case, nitrogen has only five electrons around it. To move closer
to an octet for nitrogen, we take one of the lone pairs from oxygen and use it to form a NO double bond. (We
cannot take another lone pair of electrons on oxygen and form a triple bond because nitrogen would then have
nine electrons:)
Electron-deficient Molecules
We will also encounter a few molecules that contain central atoms that do not have a filled valence shell. Generally,
these are molecules with central atoms from groups 2 and 13, outer atoms that are hydrogen, or other atoms that do not
form multiple bonds. For example, in the Lewis structures of beryllium dihydride, BeH2, and boron trifluoride, BF3,
the beryllium and boron atoms each have only four and six electrons, respectively. It is possible to draw a structure
with a double bond between a boron atom and a fluorine atom in BF3, satisfying the octet rule, but experimental
evidence indicates the bond lengths are closer to that expected for B–F single bonds. This suggests the best Lewis
structure has three B–F single bonds and an electron deficient boron. The reactivity of the compound is also consistent
with an electron deficient boron. However, the B–F bonds are slightly shorter than what is actually expected for B–F
single bonds, indicating that some double bond character is found in the actual molecule.
Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 361
An atom like the boron atom in BF3, which does not have eight electrons, is very reactive. It readily combines with
a molecule containing an atom with a lone pair of electrons. For example, NH3 reacts with BF3 because the lone pair
on nitrogen can be shared with the boron atom:
Hypervalent Molecules
Elements in the second period of the periodic table (n = 2) can accommodate only eight electrons in their valence shell
orbitals because they have only four valence orbitals (one 2s and three 2p orbitals). Elements in the third and higher
periods (n ≥ 3) have more than four valence orbitals and can share more than four pairs of electrons with other atoms
because they have empty d orbitals in the same shell. Molecules formed from these elements are sometimes called
hypervalent molecules. Figure 7.12 shows the Lewis structures for two hypervalent molecules, PCl5 and SF6.
Figure 7.12 In PCl5, the central atom phosphorus shares five pairs of electrons. In SF6, sulfur shares six pairs of
electrons.
In some hypervalent molecules, such as IF5 and XeF4, some of the electrons in the outer shell of the central atom are
lone pairs:
When we write the Lewis structures for these molecules, we find that we have electrons left over after filling the
valence shells of the outer atoms with eight electrons. These additional electrons must be assigned to the central atom.
Example 7.5
Writing Lewis Structures: Octet Rule Violations
Xenon is a noble gas, but it forms a number of stable compounds. We examined XeF4 earlier. What are the
Lewis structures of XeF2 and XeF6?
Solution
We can draw the Lewis structure of any covalent molecule by following the six steps discussed earlier. In
this case, we can condense the last few steps, since not all of them apply.
362 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Step 1. Calculate the number of valence electrons:
XeF2: 8 + (2 × 7) = 22
XeF6: 8 + (6 × 7) = 50
Step 2. Draw a skeleton joining the atoms by single bonds. Xenon will be the central atom
because fluorine cannot be a central atom:
Step 3. Distribute the remaining electrons.
XeF2: We place three lone pairs of electrons around each F atom, accounting for 12 electrons and
giving each F atom 8 electrons. Thus, six electrons (three lone pairs) remain. These lone pairs must
be placed on the Xe atom. This is acceptable because Xe atoms have empty valence shell d orbitals
and can accommodate more than eight electrons. The Lewis structure of XeF2 shows two bonding
pairs and three lone pairs of electrons around the Xe atom:
XeF6: We place three lone pairs of electrons around each F atom, accounting for 36 electrons. Two
electrons remain, and this lone pair is placed on the Xe atom:

7.4 Formal Charges and Resonance
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Compute formal charges for atoms in any Lewis structure
• Use formal charges to identify the most reasonable Lewis structure for a given molecule
• Explain the concept of resonance and draw Lewis structures representing resonance forms for a given
molecule
In the previous section, we discussed how to write Lewis structures for molecules and polyatomic ions. As we have
seen, however, in some cases, there is seemingly more than one valid structure for a molecule. We can use the concept
of formal charges to help us predict the most appropriate Lewis structure when more than one is reasonable.
Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 363
Calculating Formal Charge
The formal charge of an atom in a molecule is the hypothetical charge the atom would have if we could redistribute
the electrons in the bonds evenly between the atoms. Another way of saying this is that formal charge results when
we take the number of valence electrons of a neutral atom, subtract the nonbonding electrons, and then subtract the
number of bonds connected to that atom in the Lewis structure.
Thus, we calculate formal charge as follows:
formal charge = # valence shell electrons (free atom) − # lone pair electrons − 1
2 # bonding electrons
We can double-check formal charge calculations by determining the sum of the formal charges for the whole structure.
The sum of the formal charges of all atoms in a molecule must be zero; the sum of the formal charges in an ion should
equal the charge of the ion.
We must remember that the formal charge calculated for an atom is not the actual charge of the atom in the molecule.
Formal charge is only a useful bookkeeping procedure; it does not indicate the presence of actual charges.
Example 7.6
Calculating Formal Charge from Lewis Structures
Assign formal charges to each atom in the interhalogen ion ICl4 −.
Solution
Step 1. We divide the bonding electron pairs equally for all I–Cl bonds:
Step 2. We assign lone pairs of electrons to their atoms. Each Cl atom now has seven electrons
assigned to it, and the I atom has eight.
Step 3. Subtract this number from the number of valence electrons for the neutral atom:
I: 7 – 8 = –1
Cl: 7 – 7 = 0
The sum of the formal charges of all the atoms equals –1, which is identical to the charge of the ion
(–1).

364 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry

Step 2. Assign the lone pairs to their atom. Now each Cl atom has seven electrons and the Br atom
has seven electrons.
Step 3. Subtract this number from the number of valence electrons for the neutral atom. This gives
the formal charge:
Br: 7 – 7 = 0
Cl: 7 – 7 = 0
All atoms in BrCl3 have a formal charge of zero, and the sum of the formal charges totals zero, as it
must in a neutral molecule.

Answer: N: 0; all three Cl atoms: 0
Using Formal Charge to Predict Molecular Structure
The arrangement of atoms in a molecule or ion is called its molecular structure. In many cases, following the steps
for writing Lewis structures may lead to more than one possible molecular structure—different multiple bond and
lone-pair electron placements or different arrangements of atoms, for instance. A few guidelines involving formal
charge can be helpful in deciding which of the possible structures is most likely for a particular molecule or ion:
1. A molecular structure in which all formal charges are zero is preferable to one in which some formal charges
are not zero.
2. If the Lewis structure must have nonzero formal charges, the arrangement with the smallest nonzero formal
charges is preferable.
3. Lewis structures are preferable when adjacent formal charges are zero or of the opposite sign.
4. When we must choose among several Lewis structures with similar distributions of formal charges, the
structure with the negative formal charges on the more electronegative atoms is preferable.
To see how these guidelines apply, let us consider some possible structures for carbon dioxide, CO2. We know from
our previous discussion that the less electronegative atom typically occupies the central position, but formal charges
allow us to understand why this occurs. We can draw three possibilities for the structure: carbon in the center and
double bonds, carbon in the center with a single and triple bond, and oxygen in the center with double bonds:
Comparing the three formal charges, we can definitively identify the structure on the left as preferable because it has
only formal charges of zero (Guideline 1).
As another example, the thiocyanate ion, an ion formed from a carbon atom, a nitrogen atom, and a sulfur atom,
could have three different molecular structures: CNS–, NCS–, or CSN–. The formal charges present in each of these
molecular structures can help us pick the most likely arrangement of atoms. Possible Lewis structures and the formal
charges for each of the three possible structures for the thiocyanate ion are shown here:
Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 365
Note that the sum of the formal charges in each case is equal to the charge of the ion (–1). However, the first
arrangement of atoms is preferred because it has the lowest number of atoms with nonzero formal charges (Guideline
2). Also, it places the least electronegative atom in the center, and the negative charge on the more electronegative
element (Guideline 4).
Example 7.8
Using Formal Charge to Determine Molecular Structure
Nitrous oxide, N2O, commonly known as laughing gas, is used as an anesthetic in minor surgeries, such as
the routine extraction of wisdom teeth. Which is the likely structure for nitrous oxide?
Solution
Determining formal charge yields the following:
The structure with a terminal oxygen atom best satisfies the criteria for the most stable distribution of formal
charge:
The number of atoms with formal charges are minimized (Guideline 2), and there is no formal charge larger
than one (Guideline 2). This is again consistent with the preference for having the less electronegative atom
in the central position.

⎝NO2 −⎞
⎠ ion?
Answer: ONO–
Resonance
You may have noticed that the nitrite anion in Example 7.8 can have two possible structures with the atoms in the
same positions. The electrons involved in the N–O double bond, however, are in different positions:
If nitrite ions do indeed contain a single and a double bond, we would expect for the two bond lengths to be
different. A double bond between two atoms is shorter (and stronger) than a single bond between the same two atoms.
Experiments show, however, that both N–O bonds in NO2 − have the same strength and length, and are identical in
all other properties.
It is not possible to write a single Lewis structure for NO2 − in which nitrogen has an octet and both bonds are
equivalent. Instead, we use the concept of resonance: if two or more Lewis structures with the same arrangement
366 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
of atoms can be written for a molecule or ion, the actual distribution of electrons is an average of that shown by
the various Lewis structures. The actual distribution of electrons in each of the nitrogen-oxygen bonds in NO2 −
is the average of a double bond and a single bond. We call the individual Lewis structures resonance forms. The
actual electronic structure of the molecule (the average of the resonance forms) is called a resonance hybrid of the
individual resonance forms. A double-headed arrow between Lewis structures indicates that they are resonance forms.
Thus, the electronic structure of the NO2 − ion is shown as:
We should remember that a molecule described as a resonance hybrid never possesses an electronic structure
described by either resonance form. It does not fluctuate between resonance forms; rather, the actual electronic
structure is always the average of that shown by all resonance forms. George Wheland, one of the pioneers of
resonance theory, used a historical analogy to describe the relationship between resonance forms and resonance
hybrids. A medieval traveler, having never before seen a rhinoceros, described it as a hybrid of a dragon and a unicorn
because it had many properties in common with both. Just as a rhinoceros is neither a dragon sometimes nor a unicorn
at other times, a resonance hybrid is neither of its resonance forms at any given time. Like a rhinoceros, it is a real
entity that experimental evidence has shown to exist. It has some characteristics in common with its resonance forms,
but the resonance forms themselves are convenient, imaginary images (like the unicorn and the dragon).
The carbonate anion, CO3 2−, provides a second example of resonance:
One oxygen atom must have a double bond to carbon to complete the octet on the central atom. All oxygen atoms,
however, are equivalent, and the double bond could form from any one of the three atoms. This gives rise to three
resonance forms of the carbonate ion. Because we can write three identical resonance structures, we know that the
actual arrangement of electrons in the carbonate ion is the average of the three structures. Again, experiments show
that all three C–O bonds are exactly the same.
The online Lewis Structure Make (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16LewisMake) includes many
examples to practice drawing resonance structures.
7.5 Strengths of Ionic and Covalent Bonds
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the energetics of covalent and ionic bond formation and breakage
• Use the Born-Haber cycle to compute lattice energies for ionic compounds
• Use average covalent bond energies to estimate enthalpies of reaction
A bond’s strength describes how strongly each atom is joined to another atom, and therefore how much energy is
required to break the bond between the two atoms. In this section, you will learn about the bond strength of covalent
bonds, and then compare that to the strength of ionic bonds, which is related to the lattice energy of a compound.

Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 367
Bond Strength: Covalent Bonds
Stable molecules exist because covalent bonds hold the atoms together. We measure the strength of a covalent bond
by the energy required to break it, that is, the energy necessary to separate the bonded atoms. Separating any pair of
bonded atoms requires energy (see Figure 7.4). The stronger a bond, the greater the energy required to break it.
The energy required to break a specific covalent bond in one mole of gaseous molecules is called the bond energy
or the bond dissociation energy. The bond energy for a diatomic molecule, DX–Y, is defined as the standard enthalpy
change for the endothermic reaction:
XY(g) ⟶ X(g) + Y(g) DX−Y = ΔH°
For example, the bond energy of the pure covalent H–H bond, DH–H, is 436 kJ per mole of H–H bonds broken:
H2(g) ⟶ 2H(g) DH−H = ΔH° = 436 kJ
Molecules with three or more atoms have two or more bonds. The sum of all bond energies in such a molecule is equal
to the standard enthalpy change for the endothermic reaction that breaks all the bonds in the molecule. For example,
the sum of the four C–H bond energies in CH4, 1660 kJ, is equal to the standard enthalpy change of the reaction:
The average C–H bond energy, DC–H, is 1660/4 = 415 kJ/mol because there are four moles of C–H bonds broken per
mole of the reaction. Although the four C–H bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require
the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires 439 kJ/mol), the remaining bonds are easier
to break. The 415 kJ/mol value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond.
The strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally,
as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter
than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds
between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 7.2, and a comparison
of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in Table 7.3. When one atom bonds to various
atoms in a group, the bond strength typically decreases as we move down the group. For example, C–F is 439 kJ/mol,
C–Cl is 330 kJ/mol, and C–Br is 275 kJ/mol.

Table 7.3
We can use bond energies to calculate approximate enthalpy changes for reactions where enthalpies of formation
are not available. Calculations of this type will also tell us whether a reaction is exothermic or endothermic. An
exothermic reaction (ΔH negative, heat produced) results when the bonds in the products are stronger than the bonds
in the reactants. An endothermic reaction (ΔH positive, heat absorbed) results when the bonds in the products are
Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 369
weaker than those in the reactants.
The enthalpy change, ΔH, for a chemical reaction is approximately equal to the sum of the energy required to break all
bonds in the reactants (energy “in”, positive sign) plus the energy released when all bonds are formed in the products
(energy “out,” negative sign). This can be expressed mathematically in the following way:
ΔH = ƩD bonds broken − ƩD bonds formed
In this expression, the symbol Ʃ means “the sum of” and D represents the bond energy in kilojoules per mole, which
is always a positive number. The bond energy is obtained from a table (like Table 7.3) and will depend on whether
the particular bond is a single, double, or triple bond. Thus, in calculating enthalpies in this manner, it is important
that we consider the bonding in all reactants and products. Because D values are typically averages for one type of
bond in many different molecules, this calculation provides a rough estimate, not an exact value, for the enthalpy of
reaction.
Consider the following reaction:
H2(g) + Cl2(g) ⟶ 2HCl(g)
or
H–H(g) + Cl–Cl(g) ⟶ 2H–Cl(g)
To form two moles of HCl, one mole of H–H bonds and one mole of Cl–Cl bonds must be broken. The energy
required to break these bonds is the sum of the bond energy of the H–H bond (436 kJ/mol) and the Cl–Cl bond (243
kJ/mol). During the reaction, two moles of H–Cl bonds are formed (bond energy = 432 kJ/mol), releasing 2 × 432
kJ; or 864 kJ. Because the bonds in the products are stronger than those in the reactants, the reaction releases more
energy than it consumes:
ΔH = ƩD bonds broken − ƩD bonds formed
ΔH = ⎡
⎣DH−H + DCl−Cl⎤
⎦ − 2DH−Cl
= [436 + 243] − 2(432) = −185 kJ
This excess energy is released as heat, so the reaction is exothermic. Appendix G gives a value for the standard
molar enthalpy of formation of HCl(g), ΔHf° , of –92.307 kJ/mol. Twice that value is –184.6 kJ, which agrees well
with the answer obtained earlier for the formation of two moles of HCl.

Using Bond Energies to Calculate Approximate Enthalpy Changes
Methanol, CH3OH, may be an excellent alternative fuel. The high-temperature reaction of steam and carbon
produces a mixture of the gases carbon monoxide, CO, and hydrogen, H2, from which methanol can be
produced. Using the bond energies in Table 7.3, calculate the approximate enthalpy change, ΔH, for the
reaction here:
CO(g) + 2H2(g) ⟶ CH3 OH(g)
Solution
First, we need to write the Lewis structures of the reactants and the products:
From this, we see that ΔH for this reaction involves the energy required to break a C–O triple bond and two
H–H single bonds, as well as the energy produced by the formation of three C–H single bonds, a C–O single
bond, and an O–H single bond. We can express this as follows:

ΔH = ƩD bonds broken − ƩD bonds formed
ΔH = ⎡

⎝DH−H⎞
⎠
⎤
⎦ − ⎡
⎣3⎛
⎝DC−H⎞
⎠ + DC−O + DO−H⎤
⎦
Using the bond energy values in Table 7.3, we obtain:
ΔH = ⎡
⎣1080 + 2(436)⎤
⎦ − ⎡
⎣3(415) + 350 + 464⎤
⎦
= −107 kJ
We can compare this value to the value calculated based on ΔHf° data from Appendix G:
ΔH = ⎡
⎣ΔHf° CH3 OH(g)⎤
⎦ − ⎡
⎣ΔHf° CO(g) + 2 × ΔHf° H2⎤
⎦
= [−201.0] − [−110.52 + 2 × 0]
= −90.5 kJ
Note that there is a fairly significant gap between the values calculated using the two different methods.
This occurs because D values are the average of different bond strengths; therefore, they often give only
rough agreement with other data.

Answer: –35 kJ
Ionic Bond Strength and Lattice Energy
An ionic compound is stable because of the electrostatic attraction between its positive and negative ions. The lattice
energy of a compound is a measure of the strength of this attraction. The lattice energy (ΔHlattice) of an ionic
compound is defined as the energy required to separate one mole of the solid into its component gaseous ions. For the
ionic solid MX, the lattice energy is the enthalpy change of the process:
MX(s) ⟶ Mn+(g) + Xn−(g) ΔHlattice
Note that we are using the convention where the ionic solid is separated into ions, so our lattice energies will be
endothermic (positive values). Some texts use the equivalent but opposite convention, defining lattice energy as the
energy released when separate ions combine to form a lattice and giving negative (exothermic) values. Thus, if you
are looking up lattice energies in another reference, be certain to check which definition is being used. In both cases,
a larger magnitude for lattice energy indicates a more stable ionic compound. For sodium chloride, ΔHlattice = 769 kJ.
Thus, it requires 769 kJ to separate one mole of solid NaCl into gaseous Na+ and Cl– ions. When one mole each of
gaseous Na+ and Cl– ions form solid NaCl, 769 kJ of heat is released.
The lattice energy ΔHlattice of an ionic crystal can be expressed by the following equation (derived from Coulomb’s
law, governing the forces between electric charges):
ΔHlattice = C(Z+)(Z−)
Ro
in which C is a constant that depends on the type of crystal structure; Z+ and Z– are the charges on the ions; and
Ro is the interionic distance (the sum of the radii of the positive and negative ions). Thus, the lattice energy of an
ionic crystal increases rapidly as the charges of the ions increase and the sizes of the ions decrease. When all other
Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 371
parameters are kept constant, doubling the charge of both the cation and anion quadruples the lattice energy. For
example, the lattice energy of LiF (Z+ and Z– = 1) is 1023 kJ/mol, whereas that of MgO (Z+ and Z– = 2) is 3900 kJ/
mol (Ro is nearly the same—about 200 pm for both compounds).
Different interatomic distances produce different lattice energies. For example, we can compare the lattice energy of
MgF2 (2957 kJ/mol) to that of MgI2 (2327 kJ/mol) to observe the effect on lattice energy of the smaller ionic size of
F– as compared to I–.
Example 7.10
Lattice Energy Comparisons
The precious gem ruby is aluminum oxide, Al2O3, containing traces of Cr3+. The compound Al2Se3 is used
in the fabrication of some semiconductor devices. Which has the larger lattice energy, Al2O3 or Al2Se3?
Solution
In these two ionic compounds, the charges Z+ and Z– are the same, so the difference in lattice energy will
depend upon Ro. The O2– ion is smaller than the Se2– ion. Thus, Al2O3 would have a shorter interionic
distance than Al2Se3, and Al2O3 would have the larger lattice energy.

Zinc oxide, ZnO, is a very effective sunscreen. How would the lattice energy of ZnO compare to that of
NaCl?
Answer: ZnO would have the larger lattice energy because the Z values of both the cation and the anion in
ZnO are greater, and the interionic distance of ZnO is smaller than that of NaCl.
The Born-Haber Cycle
It is not possible to measure lattice energies directly. However, the lattice energy can be calculated using the equation
given in the previous section or by using a thermochemical cycle. The Born-Haber cycle is an application of Hess’s
law that breaks down the formation of an ionic solid into a series of individual steps:
• ΔHf° , the standard enthalpy of formation of the compound
• IE, the ionization energy of the metal
• EA, the electron affinity of the nonmetal
• ΔHs° , the enthalpy of sublimation of the metal
• D, the bond dissociation energy of the nonmetal
• ΔHlattice, the lattice energy of the compound
Figure 7.13 diagrams the Born-Haber cycle for the formation of solid cesium fluoride.
372 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Figure 7.13 The Born-Haber cycle shows the relative energies of each step involved in the formation of an ionic
solid from the necessary elements in their reference states.
We begin with the elements in their most common states, Cs(s) and F2(g). The ΔHs° represents the conversion of
solid cesium into a gas, and then the ionization energy converts the gaseous cesium atoms into cations. In the next
step, we account for the energy required to break the F–F bond to produce fluorine atoms. Converting one mole of
fluorine atoms into fluoride ions is an exothermic process, so this step gives off energy (the electron affinity) and is
shown as decreasing along the y-axis. We now have one mole of Cs cations and one mole of F anions. These ions
combine to produce solid cesium fluoride. The enthalpy change in this step is the negative of the lattice energy, so it
is also an exothermic quantity. The total energy involved in this conversion is equal to the experimentally determined
enthalpy of formation, ΔHf° , of the compound from its elements. In this case, the overall change is exothermic.
Hess’s law can also be used to show the relationship between the enthalpies of the individual steps and the enthalpy
of formation. Table 7.4 shows this for fluoride, CsF.

Thus, the lattice energy can be calculated from other values. For cesium fluoride, using this data, the lattice energy is:
ΔHlattice = (553.5 + 76.5 + 79.4 + 375.7 + 328.2) kJ/mol = 1413.3 kJ/mol
The Born-Haber cycle may also be used to calculate any one of the other quantities in the equation for lattice energy,
provided that the remainder is known. For example, if the relevant enthalpy of sublimation ΔHs° , ionization energy
(IE), bond dissociation enthalpy (D), lattice energy ΔHlattice, and standard enthalpy of formation ΔHf° are known,
the Born-Haber cycle can be used to determine the electron affinity of an atom.
Lattice energies calculated for ionic compounds are typically much higher than bond dissociation energies measured
for covalent bonds. Whereas lattice energies typically fall in the range of 600–4000 kJ/mol (some even higher),
covalent bond dissociation energies are typically between 150–400 kJ/mol for single bonds. Keep in mind, however,
that these are not directly comparable values. For ionic compounds, lattice energies are associated with many
interactions, as cations and anions pack together in an extended lattice. For covalent bonds, the bond dissociation
energy is associated with the interaction of just two atoms.
7.6 Molecular Structure and Polarity
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Predict the structures of small molecules using valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory
• Explain the concepts of polar covalent bonds and molecular polarity
• Assess the polarity of a molecule based on its bonding and structure
Thus far, we have used two-dimensional Lewis structures to represent molecules. However, molecular structure is
actually three-dimensional, and it is important to be able to describe molecular bonds in terms of their distances,
angles, and relative arrangements in space (Figure 7.14). A bond angle is the angle between any two bonds that
include a common atom, usually measured in degrees. A bond distance (or bond length) is the distance between the
nuclei of two bonded atoms along the straight line joining the nuclei. Bond distances are measured in Ångstroms (1
Å = 10–10 m) or picometers (1 pm = 10–12 m, 100 pm = 1 Å).
Figure 7.14 Bond distances (lengths) and angles are shown for the formaldehyde molecule, H2CO.

VSEPR Theory
Valence shell electron-pair repulsion theory (VSEPR theory) enables us to predict the molecular structure,
including approximate bond angles around a central atom, of a molecule from an examination of the number of bonds
and lone electron pairs in its Lewis structure. The VSEPR model assumes that electron pairs in the valence shell of
a central atom will adopt an arrangement that minimizes repulsions between these electron pairs by maximizing the
distance between them. The electrons in the valence shell of a central atom form either bonding pairs of electrons,
located primarily between bonded atoms, or lone pairs. The electrostatic repulsion of these electrons is reduced when
the various regions of high electron density assume positions as far from each other as possible.
VSEPR theory predicts the arrangement of electron pairs around each central atom and, usually, the correct
arrangement of atoms in a molecule. We should understand, however, that the theory only considers electron-pair
repulsions. Other interactions, such as nuclear-nuclear repulsions and nuclear-electron attractions, are also involved
in the final arrangement that atoms adopt in a particular molecular structure.
As a simple example of VSEPR theory, let us predict the structure of a gaseous BeF2 molecule. The Lewis structure
of BeF2 (Figure 7.15) shows only two electron pairs around the central beryllium atom. With two bonds and no lone
pairs of electrons on the central atom, the bonds are as far apart as possible, and the electrostatic repulsion between
these regions of high electron density is reduced to a minimum when they are on opposite sides of the central atom.
The bond angle is 180° (Figure 7.15).
Figure 7.15 The BeF2 molecule adopts a linear structure in which the two bonds are as far apart as possible, on
opposite sides of the Be atom.
Figure 7.16 illustrates this and other electron-pair geometries that minimize the repulsions among regions of high
electron density (bonds and/or lone pairs). Two regions of electron density around a central atom in a molecule form
a linear geometry; three regions form a trigonal planar geometry; four regions form a tetrahedral geometry; five
regions form a trigonal bipyramidal geometry; and six regions form an octahedral geometry.
Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 375
Figure 7.16 The basic electron-pair geometries predicted by VSEPR theory maximize the space around any region
of electron density (bonds or lone pairs).
Electron-pair Geometry versus Molecular Structure
It is important to note that electron-pair geometry around a central atom is not the same thing as its molecular
structure. The electron-pair geometries shown in Figure 7.16 describe all regions where electrons are located, bonds
as well as lone pairs. Molecular structure describes the location of the atoms, not the electrons.
We differentiate between these two situations by naming the geometry that includes all electron pairs the electron-
pair geometry. The structure that includes only the placement of the atoms in the molecule is called the molecular
structure. The electron-pair geometries will be the same as the molecular structures when there are no lone electron
pairs around the central atom, but they will be different when there are lone pairs present on the central atom.
For example, the methane molecule, CH4, which is the major component of natural gas, has four bonding pairs
of electrons around the central carbon atom; the electron-pair geometry is tetrahedral, as is the molecular structure
(Figure 7.17). On the other hand, the ammonia molecule, NH3, also has four electron pairs associated with the
nitrogen atom, and thus has a tetrahedral electron-pair geometry. One of these regions, however, is a lone pair, which
is not included in the molecular structure, and this lone pair influences the shape of the molecule (Figure 7.18).
376 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry

Figure 7.17 The molecular structure of the methane molecule, CH4, is shown with a tetrahedral arrangement of the
hydrogen atoms. VSEPR structures like this one are often drawn using the wedge and dash notation, in which solid
lines represent bonds in the plane of the page, solid wedges represent bonds coming up out of the plane, and dashed
lines represent bonds going down into the plane.
Figure 7.18 (a) The electron-pair geometry for the ammonia molecule is tetrahedral with one lone pair and three
single bonds. (b) The trigonal pyramidal molecular structure is determined from the electron-pair geometry. (c) The
actual bond angles deviate slightly from the idealized angles because the lone pair takes up a larger region of space
than do the single bonds, causing the HNH angle to be slightly smaller than 109.5°.
As seen in Figure 7.18, small distortions from the ideal angles in Figure 7.16 can result from differences in
repulsion between various regions of electron density. VSEPR theory predicts these distortions by establishing an
order of repulsions and an order of the amount of space occupied by different kinds of electron pairs. The order of
electron-pair repulsions from greatest to least repulsion is:
lone pair-lone pair > lone pair-bonding pair > bonding pair-bonding pair
This order of repulsions determines the amount of space occupied by different regions of electrons. A lone pair of
electrons occupies a larger region of space than the electrons in a triple bond; in turn, electrons in a triple bond occupy
more space than those in a double bond, and so on. The order of sizes from largest to smallest is:
lone pair > triple bond > double bond > single bond
Consider formaldehyde, H2CO, which is used as a preservative for biological and anatomical specimens (Figure
7.14). This molecule has regions of high electron density that consist of two single bonds and one double bond. The
basic geometry is trigonal planar with 120° bond angles, but we see that the double bond causes slightly larger angles
(121°), and the angle between the single bonds is slightly smaller (118°).
In the ammonia molecule, the three hydrogen atoms attached to the central nitrogen are not arranged in a flat, trigonal
planar molecular structure, but rather in a three-dimensional trigonal pyramid (Figure 7.18) with the nitrogen atom
at the apex and the three hydrogen atoms forming the base. The ideal bond angles in a trigonal pyramid are based
on the tetrahedral electron pair geometry. Again, there are slight deviations from the ideal because lone pairs occupy
larger regions of space than do bonding electrons. The H–N–H bond angles in NH3 are slightly smaller than the
109.5° angle in a regular tetrahedron (Figure 7.16) because the lone pair-bonding pair repulsion is greater than the
bonding pair-bonding pair repulsion (Figure 7.18). Figure 7.19 illustrates the ideal molecular structures, which are
predicted based on the electron-pair geometries for various combinations of lone pairs and bonding pairs.
Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 377
Figure 7.19 The molecular structures are identical to the electron-pair geometries when there are no lone pairs
present (first column). For a particular number of electron pairs (row), the molecular structures for one or more lone
pairs are determined based on modifications of the corresponding electron-pair geometry.
According to VSEPR theory, the terminal atom locations (Xs in Figure 7.19) are equivalent within the linear,
trigonal planar, and tetrahedral electron-pair geometries (the first three rows of the table). It does not matter which
X is replaced with a lone pair because the molecules can be rotated to convert positions. For trigonal bipyramidal
electron-pair geometries, however, there are two distinct X positions, as shown in Figure 7.20: an axial position (if
we hold a model of a trigonal bipyramid by the two axial positions, we have an axis around which we can rotate the
model) and an equatorial position (three positions form an equator around the middle of the molecule). As shown in
Figure 7.19, the axial position is surrounded by bond angles of 90°, whereas the equatorial position has more space
available because of the 120° bond angles. In a trigonal bipyramidal electron-pair geometry, lone pairs always occupy
equatorial positions because these more spacious positions can more easily accommodate the larger lone pairs.
Theoretically, we can come up with three possible arrangements for the three bonds and two lone pairs for the ClF3
molecule (Figure 7.20). The stable structure is the one that puts the lone pairs in equatorial locations, giving a T-
shaped molecular structure.
378 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry

Figure 7.20 (a) In a trigonal bipyramid, the two axial positions are located directly across from one another, whereas
the three equatorial positions are located in a triangular arrangement. (b–d) The two lone pairs (red lines) in ClF3
have several possible arrangements, but the T-shaped molecular structure (b) is the one actually observed,
consistent with the larger lone pairs both occupying equatorial positions.
When a central atom has two lone electron pairs and four bonding regions, we have an octahedral electron-pair
geometry. The two lone pairs are on opposite sides of the octahedron (180° apart), giving a square planar molecular
structure that minimizes lone pair-lone pair repulsions (Figure 7.19).
Predicting Electron Pair Geometry and Molecular Structure
The following procedure uses VSEPR theory to determine the electron pair geometries and the molecular structures:
1. Write the Lewis structure of the molecule or polyatomic ion.
2. Count the number of regions of electron density (lone pairs and bonds) around the central atom. A single,
double, or triple bond counts as one region of electron density.
3. Identify the electron-pair geometry based on the number of regions of electron density: linear, trigonal planar,
tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal, or octahedral (Figure 7.19, first column).
4. Use the number of lone pairs to determine the molecular structure (Figure 7.19). If more than one
arrangement of lone pairs and chemical bonds is possible, choose the one that will minimize repulsions,
remembering that lone pairs occupy more space than multiple bonds, which occupy more space than single
bonds. In trigonal bipyramidal arrangements, repulsion is minimized when every lone pair is in an equatorial
position. In an octahedral arrangement with two lone pairs, repulsion is minimized when the lone pairs are on
opposite sides of the central atom.
The following examples illustrate the use of VSEPR theory to predict the molecular structure of molecules or ions
that have no lone pairs of electrons. In this case, the molecular structure is identical to the electron pair geometry.

(a) We write the Lewis structure of CO2 as:
Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 379
This shows us two regions of high electron density around the carbon atom—each double bond counts as
one region, and there are no lone pairs on the carbon atom. Using VSEPR theory, we predict that the two
regions of electron density arrange themselves on opposite sides of the central atom with a bond angle of
180°. The electron-pair geometry and molecular structure are identical, and CO2 molecules are linear.
(b) We write the Lewis structure of BCl3 as:
Thus we see that BCl3 contains three bonds, and there are no lone pairs of electrons on boron. The
arrangement of three regions of high electron density gives a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry. The
B–Cl bonds lie in a plane with 120° angles between them. BCl3 also has a trigonal planar molecular
structure (Figure 7.21).

The electron-pair geometry and molecular structure of BCl3 are both trigonal planar. Note that the VSEPR

Molecular Structure for Multicenter Molecules
When a molecule or polyatomic ion has only one central atom, the molecular structure completely describes the shape
of the molecule. Larger molecules do not have a single central atom, but are connected by a chain of interior atoms
that each possess a “local” geometry. The way these local structures are oriented with respect to each other also
influences the molecular shape, but such considerations are largely beyond the scope of this introductory discussion.
For our purposes, we will only focus on determining the local structures.

The molecular shape simulator (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16MolecShape) lets you build various
molecules and practice naming their electron-pair geometries and molecular structures.
Example 7.17
Molecular Simulation
Using molecular shape simulator (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16MolecShape) allows us to
control whether bond angles and/or lone pairs are displayed by checking or unchecking the boxes under
“Options” on the right. We can also use the “Name” checkboxes at bottom-left to display or hide the electron
pair geometry (called “electron geometry” in the simulator) and/or molecular structure (called “molecular
shape” in the simulator).
Build the molecule HCN in the simulator based on the following Lewis structure:
H–C ≡ N
Click on each bond type or lone pair at right to add that group to the central atom. Once you have the
complete molecule, rotate it to examine the predicted molecular structure. What molecular structure is this?

and bond angles. Then try to find a chemical formula that would match the structure you have drawn.
Answer: Answers will vary. For example, an atom with four single bonds, a double bond, and a lone pair
has an octahedral electron-group geometry and a square pyramidal molecular structure. XeOF4 is a molecule
that adopts this structure.
Molecular Polarity and Dipole Moment
As discussed previously, polar covalent bonds connect two atoms with differing electronegativities, leaving one atom
with a partial positive charge (δ+) and the other atom with a partial negative charge (δ–), as the electrons are pulled
toward the more electronegative atom. This separation of charge gives rise to a bond dipole moment. The magnitude
of a bond dipole moment is represented by the Greek letter mu (μ) and is given by the formula shown here, where Q
is the magnitude of the partial charges (determined by the electronegativity difference) and r is the distance between
the charges:
μ = Qr
This bond moment can be represented as a vector, a quantity having both direction and magnitude (Figure 7.26).
Dipole vectors are shown as arrows pointing along the bond from the less electronegative atom toward the more
electronegative atom. A small plus sign is drawn on the less electronegative end to indicate the partially positive end
of the bond. The length of the arrow is proportional to the magnitude of the electronegativity difference between the
two atoms.
Figure 7.26 (a) There is a small difference in electronegativity between C and H, represented as a short vector. (b)
The electronegativity difference between B and F is much larger, so the vector representing the bond moment is
much longer.
A whole molecule may also have a separation of charge, depending on its molecular structure and the polarity of each
of its bonds. If such a charge separation exists, the molecule is said to be a polar molecule (or dipole); otherwise the
molecule is said to be nonpolar. The dipole moment measures the extent of net charge separation in the molecule
as a whole. We determine the dipole moment by adding the bond moments in three-dimensional space, taking into
account the molecular structure.
For diatomic molecules, there is only one bond, so its bond dipole moment determines the molecular polarity.
Homonuclear diatomic molecules such as Br2 and N2 have no difference in electronegativity, so their dipole moment
is zero. For heteronuclear molecules such as CO, there is a small dipole moment. For HF, there is a larger dipole
moment because there is a larger difference in electronegativity.
When a molecule contains more than one bond, the geometry must be taken into account. If the bonds in a molecule
are arranged such that their bond moments cancel (vector sum equals zero), then the molecule is nonpolar. This is the
situation in CO2 (Figure 7.27). Each of the bonds is polar, but the molecule as a whole is nonpolar. From the Lewis
structure, and using VSEPR theory, we determine that the CO2 molecule is linear with polar C=O bonds on opposite
sides of the carbon atom. The bond moments cancel because they are pointed in opposite directions. In the case of the
water molecule (Figure 7.27), the Lewis structure again shows that there are two bonds to a central atom, and the
electronegativity difference again shows that each of these bonds has a nonzero bond moment. In this case, however,
the molecular structure is bent because of the lone pairs on O, and the two bond moments do not cancel. Therefore,
water does have a net dipole moment and is a polar molecule (dipole).

Figure 7.27 The overall dipole moment of a molecule depends on the individual bond dipole moments and how they
are arranged. (a) Each CO bond has a bond dipole moment, but they point in opposite directions so that the net CO2
molecule is nonpolar. (b) In contrast, water is polar because the OH bond moments do not cancel out.
The OCS molecule has a structure similar to CO2, but a sulfur atom has replaced one of the oxygen atoms. To
determine if this molecule is polar, we draw the molecular structure. VSEPR theory predicts a linear molecule:
The C-O bond is considerably polar. Although C and S have very similar electronegativity values, S is slightly more
electronegative than C, and so the C-S bond is just slightly polar. Because oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur,
the oxygen end of the molecule is the negative end.
Chloromethane, CH3Cl, is a tetrahedral molecule with three slightly polar C-H bonds and a more polar C-Cl bond.
The relative electronegativities of the bonded atoms is H < C < Cl, and so the bond moments all point toward the Cl
end of the molecule and sum to yield a considerable dipole moment (the molecules are relatively polar).
For molecules of high symmetry such as BF3 (trigonal planar), CH4 (tetrahedral), PF5 (trigonal bipymidal), and SF6
(octahedral), all the bonds are of identical polarity (same bond moment) and they are oriented in geometries that
yield nonpolar molecules (dipole moment is zero). Molecules of less geometric symmetry, however, may be polar
even when all bond moments are identical. For these molecules, the directions of the equal bond moments are such
that they sum to give a nonzero dipole moment and a polar molecule. Examples of such molecules include hydrogen
sulfide, H2S (nonlinear), and ammonia, NH3 (trigonal pyramidal).
To summarize, to be polar, a molecule must:
1. Contain at least one polar covalent bond.
2. Have a molecular structure such that the sum of the vectors of each bond dipole moment does not cancel.
Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry 387
Properties of Polar Molecules
Polar molecules tend to align when placed in an electric field with the positive end of the molecule oriented toward
the negative plate and the negative end toward the positive plate (Figure 7.28). We can use an electrically charged
object to attract polar molecules, but nonpolar molecules are not attracted. Also, polar solvents are better at dissolving
polar substances, and nonpolar solvents are better at dissolving nonpolar substances.
Figure 7.28 (a) Molecules are always randomly distributed in the liquid state in the absence of an electric field. (b)
When an electric field is applied, polar molecules like HF will align to the dipoles with the field direction.
The molecule polarity simulation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16MolecPolarity) provides many ways
to explore dipole moments of bonds and molecules.
Example 7.18
Polarity Simulations
Open the molecule polarity simulation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16MolecPolarity) and
select the “Three Atoms” tab at the top. This should display a molecule ABC with three electronegativity
adjustors. You can display or hide the bond moments, molecular dipoles, and partial charges at the right.
Turning on the Electric Field will show whether the molecule moves when exposed to a field, similar to
Figure 7.28.

Determine the partial charges that will give the largest possible bond dipoles.
Answer: The largest bond moments will occur with the largest partial charges. The two solutions above
represent how unevenly the electrons are shared in the bond. The bond moments will be maximized when the
electronegativity difference is greatest. The controls for A and C should be set to one extreme, and B should
be set to the opposite extreme. Although the magnitude of the bond moment will not change based on
whether B is the most electronegative or the least, the direction of the bond moment will.

Summary
7.1 Ionic Bonding
Atoms gain or lose electrons to form ions with particularly stable electron configurations. The charges of cations
formed by the representative metals may be determined readily because, with few exceptions, the electronic structures
of these ions have either a noble gas configuration or a completely filled electron shell. The charges of anions
formed by the nonmetals may also be readily determined because these ions form when nonmetal atoms gain enough
electrons to fill their valence shells.
7.2 Covalent Bonding
Covalent bonds form when electrons are shared between atoms and are attracted by the nuclei of both atoms. In
pure covalent bonds, the electrons are shared equally. In polar covalent bonds, the electrons are shared unequally,
as one atom exerts a stronger force of attraction on the electrons than the other. The ability of an atom to attract a
pair of electrons in a chemical bond is called its electronegativity. The difference in electronegativity between two
atoms determines how polar a bond will be. In a diatomic molecule with two identical atoms, there is no difference in
electronegativity, so the bond is nonpolar or pure covalent. When the electronegativity difference is very large, as is
the case between metals and nonmetals, the bonding is characterized as ionic.
7.3 Lewis Symbols and Structures
Valence electronic structures can be visualized by drawing Lewis symbols (for atoms and monatomic ions) and
Lewis structures (for molecules and polyatomic ions). Lone pairs, unpaired electrons, and single, double, or triple
bonds are used to indicate where the valence electrons are located around each atom in a Lewis structure. Most
structures—especially those containing second row elements—obey the octet rule, in which every atom (except H) is
surrounded by eight electrons. Exceptions to the octet rule occur for odd-electron molecules (free radicals), electron-
deficient molecules, and hypervalent molecules.
7.4 Formal Charges and Resonance
In a Lewis structure, formal charges can be assigned to each atom by treating each bond as if one-half of the electrons
are assigned to each atom. These hypothetical formal charges are a guide to determining the most appropriate Lewis
structure. A structure in which the formal charges are as close to zero as possible is preferred. Resonance occurs in
cases where two or more Lewis structures with identical arrangements of atoms but different distributions of electrons
can be written. The actual distribution of electrons (the resonance hybrid) is an average of the distribution indicated
by the individual Lewis structures (the resonance forms).
7.5 Strengths of Ionic and Covalent Bonds
The strength of a covalent bond is measured by its bond dissociation energy, that is, the amount of energy required
to break that particular bond in a mole of molecules. Multiple bonds are stronger than single bonds between the same
atoms. The enthalpy of a reaction can be estimated based on the energy input required to break bonds and the energy
released when new bonds are formed. For ionic bonds, the lattice energy is the energy required to separate one mole
of a compound into its gas phase ions. Lattice energy increases for ions with higher charges and shorter distances
between ions. Lattice energies are often calculated using the Born-Haber cycle, a thermochemical cycle including all
392 Chapter 7 | Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry

of the energetic steps involved in converting elements into an ionic compound.
7.6 Molecular Structure and Polarity
VSEPR theory predicts the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule. It states that valence electrons
will assume an electron-pair geometry that minimizes repulsions between areas of high electron density (bonds and/
or lone pairs). Molecular structure, which refers only to the placement of atoms in a molecule and not the electrons,
is equivalent to electron-pair geometry only when there are no lone electron pairs around the central atom. A dipole
moment measures a separation of charge. For one bond, the bond dipole moment is determined by the difference
in electronegativity between the two atoms. For a molecule, the overall dipole moment is determined by both the
individual bond moments and how these dipoles are arranged in the molecular structure. Polar molecules (those with
an appreciable dipole moment) interact with electric fields, whereas nonpolar molecules do not.

Bonding
Figure 8.1 Oxygen molecules orient randomly most of the time, as shown in the top magnified view. However, when
we pour liquid oxygen through a magnet, the molecules line up with the magnetic field, and the attraction allows them
to stay suspended between the poles of the magnet where the magnetic field is strongest. Other diatomic molecules
(like N2) flow past the magnet. The detailed explanation of bonding described in this chapter allows us to understand
this phenomenon. (credit: modification of work by Jefferson Lab)

Introduction
We have examined the basic ideas of bonding, showing that atoms share electrons to form molecules with stable
Lewis structures and that we can predict the shapes of those molecules by valence shell electron pair repulsion
(VSEPR) theory. These ideas provide an important starting point for understanding chemical bonding. But these
models sometimes fall short in their abilities to predict the behavior of real substances. How can we reconcile the
geometries of s, p, and d atomic orbitals with molecular shapes that show angles like 120° and 109.5°? Furthermore,
we know that electrons and magnetic behavior are related through electromagnetic fields. Both N2 and O2 have fairly
similar Lewis structures that contain lone pairs of electrons.
Yet oxygen demonstrates very different magnetic behavior than nitrogen. We can pour liquid nitrogen through a
magnetic field with no visible interactions, while liquid oxygen (shown in Figure 8.1) is attracted to the magnet
and floats in the magnetic field. We need to understand the additional concepts of valence bond theory, orbital
Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding 411
hybridization, and molecular orbital theory to understand these observations.
8.1 Valence Bond Theory
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the formation of covalent bonds in terms of atomic orbital overlap
• Define and give examples of σ and π bonds
As we know, a scientific theory is a strongly supported explanation for observed natural laws or large bodies of
experimental data. For a theory to be accepted, it must explain experimental data and be able to predict behavior. For
example, VSEPR theory has gained widespread acceptance because it predicts three-dimensional molecular shapes
that are consistent with experimental data collected for thousands of different molecules. However, VSEPR theory
does not provide an explanation of chemical bonding.
There are successful theories that describe the electronic structure of atoms. We can use quantum mechanics to predict
the specific regions around an atom where electrons are likely to be located: A spherical shape for an s orbital, a
dumbbell shape for a p orbital, and so forth. However, these predictions only describe the orbitals around free atoms.
When atoms bond to form molecules, atomic orbitals are not sufficient to describe the regions where electrons will be
located in the molecule. A more complete understanding of electron distributions requires a model that can account
for the electronic structure of molecules. One popular theory holds that a covalent bond forms when a pair of electrons
is shared by two atoms and is simultaneously attracted by the nuclei of both atoms. In the following sections, we will
discuss how such bonds are described by valence bond theory and hybridization.
Valence bond theory describes a covalent bond as the overlap of half-filled atomic orbitals (each containing a single
electron) that yield a pair of electrons shared between the two bonded atoms. We say that orbitals on two different
atoms overlap when a portion of one orbital and a portion of a second orbital occupy the same region of space.
According to valence bond theory, a covalent bond results when two conditions are met: (1) an orbital on one atom
overlaps an orbital on a second atom and (2) the single electrons in each orbital combine to form an electron pair. The
mutual attraction between this negatively charged electron pair and the two atoms’ positively charged nuclei serves to
physically link the two atoms through a force we define as a covalent bond. The strength of a covalent bond depends
on the extent of overlap of the orbitals involved. Orbitals that overlap extensively form bonds that are stronger than
those that have less overlap.
The energy of the system depends on how much the orbitals overlap. Figure 8.2 illustrates how the sum of the
energies of two hydrogen atoms (the colored curve) changes as they approach each other. When the atoms are far
apart there is no overlap, and by convention we set the sum of the energies at zero. As the atoms move together, their
orbitals begin to overlap. Each electron begins to feel the attraction of the nucleus in the other atom. In addition, the
electrons begin to repel each other, as do the nuclei. While the atoms are still widely separated, the attractions are
slightly stronger than the repulsions, and the energy of the system decreases. (A bond begins to form.) As the atoms
move closer together, the overlap increases, so the attraction of the nuclei for the electrons continues to increase (as do
the repulsions among electrons and between the nuclei). At some specific distance between the atoms, which varies
depending on the atoms involved, the energy reaches its lowest (most stable) value. This optimum distance between
the two bonded nuclei is the bond distance between the two atoms. The bond is stable because at this point, the
attractive and repulsive forces combine to create the lowest possible energy configuration. If the distance between the
nuclei were to decrease further, the repulsions between nuclei and the repulsions as electrons are confined in closer
proximity to each other would become stronger than the attractive forces. The energy of the system would then rise
(making the system destabilized), as shown at the far left of Figure 8.2.

Figure 8.2 (a) The interaction of two hydrogen atoms changes as a function of distance. (b) The energy of the
system changes as the atoms interact. The lowest (most stable) energy occurs at a distance of 74 pm, which is the
bond length observed for the H2 molecule.
The bond energy is the difference between the energy minimum (which occurs at the bond distance) and the energy
of the two separated atoms. This is the quantity of energy released when the bond is formed. Conversely, the same
amount of energy is required to break the bond. For the H2 molecule shown in Figure 8.2, at the bond distance of 74
pm the system is 7.24 × 10−19 J lower in energy than the two separated hydrogen atoms. This may seem like a small
number. However, we know from our earlier description of thermochemistry that bond energies are often discussed
on a per-mole basis. For example, it requires 7.24 × 10−19 J to break one H–H bond, but it takes 4.36 × 105 J to
break 1 mole of H–H bonds. A comparison of some bond lengths and energies is shown in Table 8.1. We can find
many of these bonds in a variety of molecules, and this table provides average values. For example, breaking the first
C–H bond in CH4 requires 439.3 kJ/mol, while breaking the first C–H bond in H–CH2C6H5 (a common paint thinner)
requires 375.5 kJ/mol.

In addition to the distance between two orbitals, the orientation of orbitals also affects their overlap (other than for
two s orbitals, which are spherically symmetric). Greater overlap is possible when orbitals are oriented such that they
overlap on a direct line between the two nuclei. Figure 8.3 illustrates this for two p orbitals from different atoms;
the overlap is greater when the orbitals overlap end to end rather than at an angle.
Figure 8.3 (a) The overlap of two p orbitals is greatest when the orbitals are directed end to end. (b) Any other
arrangement results in less overlap. The dots indicate the locations of the nuclei.
The overlap of two s orbitals (as in H2), the overlap of an s orbital and a p orbital (as in HCl), and the end-to-end
overlap of two p orbitals (as in Cl2) all produce sigma bonds (σ bonds), as illustrated in Figure 8.4. A σ bond is
a covalent bond in which the electron density is concentrated in the region along the internuclear axis; that is, a line
between the nuclei would pass through the center of the overlap region. Single bonds in Lewis structures are described
as σ bonds in valence bond theory.
Figure 8.4 Sigma (σ) bonds form from the overlap of the following: (a) two s orbitals, (b) an s orbital and a p orbital,
and (c) two p orbitals. The dots indicate the locations of the nuclei.
A pi bond (π bond) is a type of covalent bond that results from the side-by-side overlap of two p orbitals, as
illustrated in Figure 8.5. In a π bond, the regions of orbital overlap lie on opposite sides of the internuclear axis.
Along the axis itself, there is a node, that is, a plane with no probability of finding an electron.

Figure 8.5 Pi (π) bonds form from the side-by-side overlap of two p orbitals. The dots indicate the location of the
nuclei.
While all single bonds are σ bonds, multiple bonds consist of both σ and π bonds. As the Lewis structures below
suggest, O2 contains a double bond, and N2 contains a triple bond. The double bond consists of one σ bond and one
π bond, and the triple bond consists of one σ bond and two π bonds. Between any two atoms, the first bond formed
will always be a σ bond, but there can only be one σ bond in any one location. In any multiple bond, there will be one
σ bond, and the remaining one or two bonds will be π bonds. These bonds are described in more detail later in this
chapter.
As seen in Table 8.1, an average carbon-carbon single bond is 347 kJ/mol, while in a carbon-carbon double bond,
the π bond increases the bond strength by 267 kJ/mol. Adding an additional π bond causes a further increase of 225
kJ/mol. We can see a similar pattern when we compare other σ and π bonds. Thus, each individual π bond is generally
weaker than a corresponding σ bond between the same two atoms. In a σ bond, there is a greater degree of orbital
overlap than in a π bond.
Example 8.1
Counting σ and π Bonds
Butadiene, C4H6, is used to make synthetic rubber. Identify the number of σ and π bonds contained in this
molecule.
Solution
There are six σ C–H bonds and one σ C–C bond, for a total of seven from the single bonds. There are two
double bonds that each have a π bond in addition to the σ bond. This gives a total nine σ and two π bonds
overall.

• Explain the concept of atomic orbital hybridization
• Determine the hybrid orbitals associated with various molecular geometries
Thinking in terms of overlapping atomic orbitals is one way for us to explain how chemical bonds form in diatomic
molecules. However, to understand how molecules with more than two atoms form stable bonds, we require a more
detailed model. As an example, let us consider the water molecule, in which we have one oxygen atom bonding to
two hydrogen atoms. Oxygen has the electron configuration 1s22s22p4, with two unpaired electrons (one in each of
the two 2p orbitals). Valence bond theory would predict that the two O–H bonds form from the overlap of these two
2p orbitals with the 1s orbitals of the hydrogen atoms. If this were the case, the bond angle would be 90°, as shown
in Figure 8.6, because p orbitals are perpendicular to each other. Experimental evidence shows that the bond angle
is 104.5°, not 90°. The prediction of the valence bond theory model does not match the real-world observations of a
water molecule; a different model is needed.
Figure 8.6 The hypothetical overlap of two of the 2p orbitals on an oxygen atom (red) with the 1s orbitals of two
hydrogen atoms (blue) would produce a bond angle of 90°. This is not consistent with experimental evidence.[1]
Quantum-mechanical calculations suggest why the observed bond angles in H2O differ from those predicted by
the overlap of the 1s orbital of the hydrogen atoms with the 2p orbitals of the oxygen atom. The mathematical
expression known as the wave function, ψ, contains information about each orbital and the wavelike properties of
electrons in an isolated atom. When atoms are bound together in a molecule, the wave functions combine to produce
new mathematical descriptions that have different shapes. This process of combining the wave functions for atomic
orbitals is called hybridization and is mathematically accomplished by the linear combination of atomic orbitals,
LCAO, (a technique that we will encounter again later). The new orbitals that result are called hybrid orbitals.
The valence orbitals in an isolated oxygen atom are a 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals. The valence orbitals in an
oxygen atom in a water molecule differ; they consist of four equivalent hybrid orbitals that point approximately
toward the corners of a tetrahedron (Figure 8.7). Consequently, the overlap of the O and H orbitals should result
in a tetrahedral bond angle (109.5°). The observed angle of 104.5° is experimental evidence for which quantum-
mechanical calculations give a useful explanation: Valence bond theory must include a hybridization component to
give accurate predictions.
1. Note that orbitals may sometimes be drawn in an elongated “balloon” shape rather than in a more realistic “plump” shape in order to
make the geometry easier to visualize.

Figure 8.7 (a) A water molecule has four regions of electron density, so VSEPR theory predicts a tetrahedral
arrangement of hybrid orbitals. (b) Two of the hybrid orbitals on oxygen contain lone pairs, and the other two overlap
with the 1s orbitals of hydrogen atoms to form the O–H bonds in H2O. This description is more consistent with the
experimental structure.
The following ideas are important in understanding hybridization:
1. Hybrid orbitals do not exist in isolated atoms. They are formed only in covalently bonded atoms.
2. Hybrid orbitals have shapes and orientations that are very different from those of the atomic orbitals in isolated
atoms.
3. A set of hybrid orbitals is generated by combining atomic orbitals. The number of hybrid orbitals in a set is
equal to the number of atomic orbitals that were combined to produce the set.
4. All orbitals in a set of hybrid orbitals are equivalent in shape and energy.
5. The type of hybrid orbitals formed in a bonded atom depends on its electron-pair geometry as predicted by the
VSEPR theory.
6. Hybrid orbitals overlap to form σ bonds. Unhybridized orbitals overlap to form π bonds.
In the following sections, we shall discuss the common types of hybrid orbitals.
sp Hybridization
The beryllium atom in a gaseous BeCl2 molecule is an example of a central atom with no lone pairs of electrons in
a linear arrangement of three atoms. There are two regions of valence electron density in the BeCl2 molecule that
correspond to the two covalent Be–Cl bonds. To accommodate these two electron domains, two of the Be atom’s
four valence orbitals will mix to yield two hybrid orbitals. This hybridization process involves mixing of the valence
s orbital with one of the valence p orbitals to yield two equivalent sp hybrid orbitals that are oriented in a linear
geometry (Figure 8.8). In this figure, the set of sp orbitals appears similar in shape to the original p orbital, but
there is an important difference. The number of atomic orbitals combined always equals the number of hybrid orbitals
formed. The p orbital is one orbital that can hold up to two electrons. The sp set is two equivalent orbitals that point
180° from each other. The two electrons that were originally in the s orbital are now distributed to the two sp orbitals,
which are half filled. In gaseous BeCl2, these half-filled hybrid orbitals will overlap with orbitals from the chlorine
atoms to form two identical σ bonds.
Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding 417
Figure 8.8 Hybridization of an s orbital (blue) and a p orbital (red) of the same atom produces two sp hybrid orbitals
(yellow). Each hybrid orbital is oriented primarily in just one direction. Note that each sp orbital contains one lobe that
is significantly larger than the other. The set of two sp orbitals are oriented at 180°, which is consistent with the
geometry for two domains.
We illustrate the electronic differences in an isolated Be atom and in the bonded Be atom in the orbital energy-level
diagram in Figure 8.9. These diagrams represent each orbital by a horizontal line (indicating its energy) and each
electron by an arrow. Energy increases toward the top of the diagram. We use one upward arrow to indicate one
electron in an orbital and two arrows (up and down) to indicate two electrons of opposite spin.
Figure 8.9 This orbital energy-level diagram shows the sp hybridized orbitals on Be in the linear BeCl2 molecule.
Each of the two sp hybrid orbitals holds one electron and is thus half filled and available for bonding via overlap with a
Cl 3p orbital.
When atomic orbitals hybridize, the valence electrons occupy the newly created orbitals. The Be atom had two
valence electrons, so each of the sp orbitals gets one of these electrons. Each of these electrons pairs up with the
unpaired electron on a chlorine atom when a hybrid orbital and a chlorine orbital overlap during the formation of the
Be–Cl bonds.
Any central atom surrounded by just two regions of valence electron density in a molecule will exhibit sp

hybridization. Other examples include the mercury atom in the linear HgCl2 molecule, the zinc atom in Zn(CH3)2,
which contains a linear C–Zn–C arrangement, and the carbon atoms in HCCH and CO2.

to learn about visualizing hybrid orbitals in three dimensions.
sp2 Hybridization
The valence orbitals of a central atom surrounded by three regions of electron density consist of a set of three sp2
hybrid orbitals and one unhybridized p orbital. This arrangement results from sp2 hybridization, the mixing of one
s orbital and two p orbitals to produce three identical hybrid orbitals oriented in a trigonal planar geometry (Figure
8.10).
Figure 8.10 The hybridization of an s orbital (blue) and two p orbitals (red) produces three equivalent sp2 hybridized
orbitals (yellow) oriented at 120° with respect to each other. The remaining unhybridized p orbital is not shown here,
but is located along the z axis.
Although quantum mechanics yields the “plump” orbital lobes as depicted in Figure 8.10, sometimes for clarity
these orbitals are drawn thinner and without the minor lobes, as in Figure 8.11, to avoid obscuring other features
of a given illustration. We will use these “thinner” representations whenever the true view is too crowded to easily
visualize.

Figure 8.11 This alternate way of drawing the trigonal planar sp2 hybrid orbitals is sometimes used in more crowded
figures.
The observed structure of the borane molecule, BH3, suggests sp2 hybridization for boron in this compound. The
molecule is trigonal planar, and the boron atom is involved in three bonds to hydrogen atoms (Figure 8.12). We can
illustrate the comparison of orbitals and electron distribution in an isolated boron atom and in the bonded atom in
BH3 as shown in the orbital energy level diagram in Figure 8.13. We redistribute the three valence electrons of the
boron atom in the three sp2 hybrid orbitals, and each boron electron pairs with a hydrogen electron when B–H bonds
form.
Figure 8.12 BH3 is an electron-deficient molecule with a trigonal planar structure.
Figure 8.13 In an isolated B atom, there are one 2s and three 2p valence orbitals. When boron is in a molecule with
three regions of electron density, three of the orbitals hybridize and create a set of three sp2 orbitals and one
unhybridized 2p orbital. The three half-filled hybrid orbitals each overlap with an orbital from a hydrogen atom to form
three σ bonds in BH3.
Any central atom surrounded by three regions of electron density will exhibit sp2 hybridization. This includes
molecules with a lone pair on the central atom, such as ClNO (Figure 8.14), or molecules with two single bonds and
a double bond connected to the central atom, as in formaldehyde, CH2O, and ethene, H2CCH2.

Figure 8.14 The central atom(s) in each of the structures shown contain three regions of electron density and are
sp2 hybridized. As we know from the discussion of VSEPR theory, a region of electron density contains all of the
electrons that point in one direction. A lone pair, an unpaired electron, a single bond, or a multiple bond would each
count as one region of electron density.
sp3 Hybridization
The valence orbitals of an atom surrounded by a tetrahedral arrangement of bonding pairs and lone pairs consist of
a set of four sp3 hybrid orbitals. The hybrids result from the mixing of one s orbital and all three p orbitals that
produces four identical sp3 hybrid orbitals (Figure 8.15). Each of these hybrid orbitals points toward a different
corner of a tetrahedron.
Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding 421
Figure 8.15 The hybridization of an s orbital (blue) and three p orbitals (red) produces four equivalent sp3 hybridized
orbitals (yellow) oriented at 109.5° with respect to each other.
A molecule of methane, CH4, consists of a carbon atom surrounded by four hydrogen atoms at the corners of a
tetrahedron. The carbon atom in methane exhibits sp3 hybridization. We illustrate the orbitals and electron distribution
in an isolated carbon atom and in the bonded atom in CH4 in Figure 8.16. The four valence electrons of the carbon
atom are distributed equally in the hybrid orbitals, and each carbon electron pairs with a hydrogen electron when the
C–H bonds form.
422 Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding

Figure 8.16 The four valence atomic orbitals from an isolated carbon atom all hybridize when the carbon bonds in a
molecule like CH4 with four regions of electron density. This creates four equivalent sp3 hybridized orbitals. Overlap of
each of the hybrid orbitals with a hydrogen orbital creates a C–H σ bond.
In a methane molecule, the 1s orbital of each of the four hydrogen atoms overlaps with one of the four sp3 orbitals
of the carbon atom to form a sigma (σ) bond. This results in the formation of four strong, equivalent covalent bonds
between the carbon atom and each of the hydrogen atoms to produce the methane molecule, CH4.
The structure of ethane, C2H6, is similar to that of methane in that each carbon in ethane has four neighboring atoms
arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron—three hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom (Figure 8.17). However, in
ethane an sp3 orbital of one carbon atom overlaps end to end with an sp3 orbital of a second carbon atom to form
a σ bond between the two carbon atoms. Each of the remaining sp3 hybrid orbitals overlaps with an s orbital of a
hydrogen atom to form carbon–hydrogen σ bonds. The structure and overall outline of the bonding orbitals of ethane
are shown in Figure 8.17. The orientation of the two CH3 groups is not fixed relative to each other. Experimental
evidence shows that rotation around σ bonds occurs easily.
Figure 8.17 (a) In the ethane molecule, C2H6, each carbon has four sp3 orbitals. (b) These four orbitals overlap to
form seven σ bonds.
An sp3 hybrid orbital can also hold a lone pair of electrons. For example, the nitrogen atom in ammonia is surrounded
by three bonding pairs and a lone pair of electrons directed to the four corners of a tetrahedron. The nitrogen atom is
sp3 hybridized with one hybrid orbital occupied by the lone pair.
The molecular structure of water is consistent with a tetrahedral arrangement of two lone pairs and two bonding pairs
of electrons. Thus we say that the oxygen atom is sp3 hybridized, with two of the hybrid orbitals occupied by lone
pairs and two by bonding pairs. Since lone pairs occupy more space than bonding pairs, structures that contain lone
pairs have bond angles slightly distorted from the ideal. Perfect tetrahedra have angles of 109.5°, but the observed
angles in ammonia (107.3°) and water (104.5°) are slightly smaller. Other examples of sp3 hybridization include CCl4,
Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding 423
PCl3, and NCl3.
sp3d and sp3d2 Hybridization
To describe the five bonding orbitals in a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement, we must use five of the valence shell
atomic orbitals (the s orbital, the three p orbitals, and one of the d orbitals), which gives five sp3d hybrid orbitals.
With an octahedral arrangement of six hybrid orbitals, we must use six valence shell atomic orbitals (the s orbital,
the three p orbitals, and two of the d orbitals in its valence shell), which gives six sp3d2 hybrid orbitals. These
hybridizations are only possible for atoms that have d orbitals in their valence subshells (that is, not those in the first
or second period).
In a molecule of phosphorus pentachloride, PCl5, there are five P–Cl bonds (thus five pairs of valence electrons
around the phosphorus atom) directed toward the corners of a trigonal bipyramid. We use the 3s orbital, the three 3p
orbitals, and one of the 3d orbitals to form the set of five sp3d hybrid orbitals (Figure 8.19) that are involved in the
P–Cl bonds. Other atoms that exhibit sp3d hybridization include the sulfur atom in SF4 and the chlorine atoms in ClF3
and in ClF4 +. (The electrons on fluorine atoms are omitted for clarity.)
Figure 8.18 The three compounds pictured exhibit sp3d hybridization in the central atom and a trigonal bipyramid
form. SF4 and ClF4 + have one lone pair of electrons on the central atom, and ClF3 has two lone pairs giving it the
T-shape shown.
Figure 8.19 (a) The five regions of electron density around phosphorus in PCl5 require five hybrid sp3d orbitals. (b)
These orbitals combine to form a trigonal bipyramidal structure with each large lobe of the hybrid orbital pointing at a
vertex. As before, there are also small lobes pointing in the opposite direction for each orbital (not shown for clarity).
The sulfur atom in sulfur hexafluoride, SF6, exhibits sp3d2 hybridization. A molecule of sulfur hexafluoride has six
bonding pairs of electrons connecting six fluorine atoms to a single sulfur atom. There are no lone pairs of electrons
on the central atom. To bond six fluorine atoms, the 3s orbital, the three 3p orbitals, and two of the 3d orbitals
form six equivalent sp3d2 hybrid orbitals, each directed toward a different corner of an octahedron. Other atoms that
exhibit sp3d2 hybridization include the phosphorus atom in PCl6 −, the iodine atom in the interhalogens IF6 +, IF5,
ICl4 −, IF4 − and the xenon atom in XeF4.

sp3d2 orbitals form an octahedral structure around sulfur. Again, the minor lobe of each orbital is not shown for clarity.
Assignment of Hybrid Orbitals to Central Atoms
The hybridization of an atom is determined based on the number of regions of electron density that surround it.
The geometrical arrangements characteristic of the various sets of hybrid orbitals are shown in Figure 8.21. These
arrangements are identical to those of the electron-pair geometries predicted by VSEPR theory. VSEPR theory
predicts the shapes of molecules, and hybrid orbital theory provides an explanation for how those shapes are formed.
To find the hybridization of a central atom, we can use the following guidelines:
1. Determine the Lewis structure of the molecule.
2. Determine the number of regions of electron density around an atom using VSEPR theory, in which single
bonds, multiple bonds, radicals, and lone pairs each count as one region.
3. Assign the set of hybridized orbitals from Figure 8.21 that corresponds to this geometry.
Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding 425
Figure 8.21 The shapes of hybridized orbital sets are consistent with the electron-pair geometries. For example, an
atom surrounded by three regions of electron density is sp2 hybridized, and the three sp2 orbitals are arranged in a
trigonal planar fashion.
It is important to remember that hybridization was devised to rationalize experimentally observed molecular
geometries. The model works well for molecules containing small central atoms, in which the valence electron pairs
are close together in space. However, for larger central atoms, the valence-shell electron pairs are farther from the
nucleus, and there are fewer repulsions. Their compounds exhibit structures that are often not consistent with VSEPR
theory, and hybridized orbitals are not necessary to explain the observed data. For example, we have discussed the
H–O–H bond angle in H2O, 104.5°, which is more consistent with sp3 hybrid orbitals (109.5°) on the central atom
than with 2p orbitals (90°). Sulfur is in the same group as oxygen, and H2S has a similar Lewis structure. However,
it has a much smaller bond angle (92.1°), which indicates much less hybridization on sulfur than oxygen. Continuing
down the group, tellurium is even larger than sulfur, and for H2Te, the observed bond angle (90°) is consistent with
overlap of the 5p orbitals, without invoking hybridization. We invoke hybridization where it is necessary to explain
the observed structures.

8.3 Multiple Bonds
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe multiple covalent bonding in terms of atomic orbital overlap
• Relate the concept of resonance to π-bonding and electron delocalization
The hybrid orbital model appears to account well for the geometry of molecules involving single covalent bonds. Is
it also capable of describing molecules containing double and triple bonds? We have already discussed that multiple
bonds consist of σ and π bonds. Next we can consider how we visualize these components and how they relate to
hybrid orbitals. The Lewis structure of ethene, C2H4, shows us that each carbon atom is surrounded by one other
carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms.
The three bonding regions form a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry. Thus we expect the σ bonds from each
carbon atom are formed using a set of sp2 hybrid orbitals that result from hybridization of two of the 2p orbitals and
the 2s orbital (Figure 8.22). These orbitals form the C–H single bonds and the σ bond in the C = C double bond
(Figure 8.23). The π bond in the C = C double bond results from the overlap of the third (remaining) 2p orbital on
each carbon atom that is not involved in hybridization. This unhybridized p orbital (lobes shown in red and blue in
Figure 8.23) is perpendicular to the plane of the sp2 hybrid orbitals. Thus the unhybridized 2p orbitals overlap in a
side-by-side fashion, above and below the internuclear axis (Figure 8.23) and form a π bond.
428 Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Figure 8.22 In ethene, each carbon atom is sp2 hybridized, and the sp2 orbitals and the p orbital are singly
occupied. The hybrid orbitals overlap to form σ bonds, while the p orbitals on each carbon atom overlap to form a π
bond.
Figure 8.23 In the ethene molecule, C2H4, there are (a) five σ bonds. One C–C σ bond results from overlap of sp2
hybrid orbitals on the carbon atom with one sp2 hybrid orbital on the other carbon atom. Four C–H bonds result from
the overlap between the C atoms' sp2 orbitals with s orbitals on the hydrogen atoms. (b) The π bond is formed by the
side-by-side overlap of the two unhybridized p orbitals in the two carbon atoms. The two lobes of the π bond are
above and below the plane of the σ system.
In an ethene molecule, the four hydrogen atoms and the two carbon atoms are all in the same plane. If the two
planes of sp2 hybrid orbitals tilted relative to each other, the p orbitals would not be oriented to overlap efficiently
to create the π bond. The planar configuration for the ethene molecule occurs because it is the most stable bonding
arrangement. This is a significant difference between σ and π bonds; rotation around single (σ) bonds occurs easily
because the end-to-end orbital overlap does not depend on the relative orientation of the orbitals on each atom in the
bond. In other words, rotation around the internuclear axis does not change the extent to which the σ bonding orbitals
overlap because the bonding electron density is symmetric about the axis. Rotation about the internuclear axis is much
more difficult for multiple bonds; however, this would drastically alter the off-axis overlap of the π bonding orbitals,
essentially breaking the π bond.
In molecules with sp hybrid orbitals, two unhybridized p orbitals remain on the atom (Figure 8.24). We find this
situation in acetylene, H−C≡C−H, which is a linear molecule. The sp hybrid orbitals of the two carbon atoms
overlap end to end to form a σ bond between the carbon atoms (Figure 8.25). The remaining sp orbitals form σ
bonds with hydrogen atoms. The two unhybridized p orbitals per carbon are positioned such that they overlap side by
side and, hence, form two π bonds. The two carbon atoms of acetylene are thus bound together by one σ bond and
two π bonds, giving a triple bond.
Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding 429

unhybridized p orbitals at perpendicular angles.
Figure 8.25 (a) In the acetylene molecule, C2H2, there are two C–H σ bonds and a C ≡ C triple bond involving one
C–C σ bond and two C–C π bonds. The dashed lines, each connecting two lobes, indicate the side-by-side overlap of
the four unhybridized p orbitals. (b) This shows the overall outline of the bonds in C2H2. The two lobes of each of the
π bonds are positioned across from each other around the line of the C–C σ bond.
Hybridization involves only σ bonds, lone pairs of electrons, and single unpaired electrons (radicals). Structures that
account for these features describe the correct hybridization of the atoms. However, many structures also include
resonance forms. Remember that resonance forms occur when various arrangements of π bonds are possible. Since
the arrangement of π bonds involves only the unhybridized orbitals, resonance does not influence the assignment of
hybridization.
For example, molecule benzene has two resonance forms (Figure 8.26). We can use either of these forms to
determine that each of the carbon atoms is bonded to three other atoms with no lone pairs, so the correct hybridization
is sp2. The electrons in the unhybridized p orbitals form π bonds. Neither resonance structure completely describes
the electrons in the π bonds. They are not located in one position or the other, but in reality are delocalized throughout
the ring. Valence bond theory does not easily address delocalization. Bonding in molecules with resonance forms is
better described by molecular orbital theory. (See the next module.)

8.4 Molecular Orbital Theory
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Outline the basic quantum-mechanical approach to deriving molecular orbitals from atomic orbitals
• Describe traits of bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals
• Calculate bond orders based on molecular electron configurations
• Write molecular electron configurations for first- and second-row diatomic molecules
• Relate these electron configurations to the molecules’ stabilities and magnetic properties
For almost every covalent molecule that exists, we can now draw the Lewis structure, predict the electron-pair
geometry, predict the molecular geometry, and come close to predicting bond angles. However, one of the most
important molecules we know, the oxygen molecule O2, presents a problem with respect to its Lewis structure. We
would write the following Lewis structure for O2:
Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding 431
This electronic structure adheres to all the rules governing Lewis theory. There is an O=O double bond, and each
oxygen atom has eight electrons around it. However, this picture is at odds with the magnetic behavior of oxygen.
By itself, O2 is not magnetic, but it is attracted to magnetic fields. Thus, when we pour liquid oxygen past a strong
magnet, it collects between the poles of the magnet and defies gravity, as in Figure 8.1. Such attraction to a magnetic
field is called paramagnetism, and it arises in molecules that have unpaired electrons. And yet, the Lewis structure
of O2 indicates that all electrons are paired. How do we account for this discrepancy?
Magnetic susceptibility measures the force experienced by a substance in a magnetic field. When we compare the
weight of a sample to the weight measured in a magnetic field (Figure 8.27), paramagnetic samples that are attracted
to the magnet will appear heavier because of the force exerted by the magnetic field. We can calculate the number of
unpaired electrons based on the increase in weight.
Figure 8.27 A Gouy balance compares the mass of a sample in the presence of a magnetic field with the mass with
the electromagnet turned off to determine the number of unpaired electrons in a sample.
Experiments show that each O2 molecule has two unpaired electrons. The Lewis-structure model does not predict the
presence of these two unpaired electrons. Unlike oxygen, the apparent weight of most molecules decreases slightly in
the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field. Materials in which all of the electrons are paired are diamagnetic
and weakly repel a magnetic field. Paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials do not act as permanent magnets. Only in
the presence of an applied magnetic field do they demonstrate attraction or repulsion.

Water, like most molecules, contains all paired electrons. Living things contain a large percentage of
water, so they demonstrate diamagnetic behavior. If you place a frog near a sufficiently large magnet, it
will levitate. You can see videos (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16diamagnetic) of diamagnetic floating
frogs, strawberries, and more.
Molecular orbital theory (MO theory) provides an explanation of chemical bonding that accounts for the
paramagnetism of the oxygen molecule. It also explains the bonding in a number of other molecules, such as
violations of the octet rule and more molecules with more complicated bonding (beyond the scope of this text) that are
difficult to describe with Lewis structures. Additionally, it provides a model for describing the energies of electrons in
a molecule and the probable location of these electrons. Unlike valence bond theory, which uses hybrid orbitals that
are assigned to one specific atom, MO theory uses the combination of atomic orbitals to yield molecular orbitals that
are delocalized over the entire molecule rather than being localized on its constituent atoms. MO theory also helps us
understand why some substances are electrical conductors, others are semiconductors, and still others are insulators.
Table 8.2 summarizes the main points of the two complementary bonding theories. Both theories provide different,
useful ways of describing molecular structure.

Table 8.2
Molecular orbital theory describes the distribution of electrons in molecules in much the same way that the
distribution of electrons in atoms is described using atomic orbitals. Using quantum mechanics, the behavior of an
electron in a molecule is still described by a wave function, Ψ, analogous to the behavior in an atom. Just like electrons
around isolated atoms, electrons around atoms in molecules are limited to discrete (quantized) energies. The region
of space in which a valence electron in a molecule is likely to be found is called a molecular orbital (Ψ2). Like an
atomic orbital, a molecular orbital is full when it contains two electrons with opposite spin.
We will consider the molecular orbitals in molecules composed of two identical atoms (H2 or Cl2, for example). Such
molecules are called homonuclear diatomic molecules. In these diatomic molecules, several types of molecular
orbitals occur.
The mathematical process of combining atomic orbitals to generate molecular orbitals is called the linear
combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). The wave function describes the wavelike properties of an electron.
Molecular orbitals are combinations of atomic orbital wave functions. Combining waves can lead to constructive
interference, in which peaks line up with peaks, or destructive interference, in which peaks line up with troughs
(Figure 8.28). In orbitals, the waves are three dimensional, and they combine with in-phase waves producing regions

with a higher probability of electron density and out-of-phase waves producing nodes, or regions of no electron
density.
Figure 8.28 (a) When in-phase waves combine, constructive interference produces a wave with greater amplitude.
(b) When out-of-phase waves combine, destructive interference produces a wave with less (or no) amplitude.
There are two types of molecular orbitals that can form from the overlap of two atomic s orbitals on adjacent atoms.
The two types are illustrated in Figure 8.29. The in-phase combination produces a lower energy σs molecular
orbital (read as "sigma-s") in which most of the electron density is directly between the nuclei. The out-of-phase
addition (which can also be thought of as subtracting the wave functions) produces a higher energy molecular orbital
(read as "sigma-s-star") molecular orbital in which there is a node between the nuclei. The asterisk signifies that the
orbital is an antibonding orbital. Electrons in a σs orbital are attracted by both nuclei at the same time and are more
stable (of lower energy) than they would be in the isolated atoms. Adding electrons to these orbitals creates a force
that holds the two nuclei together, so we call these orbitals bonding orbitals. Electrons in the σs* orbitals are located
well away from the region between the two nuclei. The attractive force between the nuclei and these electrons pulls
the two nuclei apart. Hence, these orbitals are called antibonding orbitals. Electrons fill the lower-energy bonding
orbital before the higher-energy antibonding orbital, just as they fill lower-energy atomic orbitals before they fill
higher-energy atomic orbitals.
Figure 8.29 Sigma (σ) and sigma-star (σ*) molecular orbitals are formed by the combination of two s atomic orbitals.
The plus (+) signs indicate the locations of nuclei.

In p orbitals, the wave function gives rise to two lobes with opposite phases, analogous to how a two-dimensional
wave has both parts above and below the average. We indicate the phases by shading the orbital lobes different colors.
When orbital lobes of the same phase overlap, constructive wave interference increases the electron density. When
regions of opposite phase overlap, the destructive wave interference decreases electron density and creates nodes.
When p orbitals overlap end to end, they create σ and σ* orbitals (Figure 8.30). If two atoms are located along
the x-axis in a Cartesian coordinate system, the two px orbitals overlap end to end and form σpx (bonding) and σ px*
(antibonding) (read as "sigma-p-x" and "sigma-p-x star," respectively). Just as with s-orbital overlap, the asterisk
indicates the orbital with a node between the nuclei, which is a higher-energy, antibonding orbital.
Figure 8.30 Combining wave functions of two p atomic orbitals along the internuclear axis creates two molecular
orbitals, σp and σ p* .
The side-by-side overlap of two p orbitals gives rise to a pi (π) bonding molecular orbital and a π* antibonding
molecular orbital, as shown in Figure 8.31. In valence bond theory, we describe π bonds as containing a nodal
plane containing the internuclear axis and perpendicular to the lobes of the p orbitals, with electron density on either
side of the node. In molecular orbital theory, we describe the π orbital by this same shape, and a π bond exists when
this orbital contains electrons. Electrons in this orbital interact with both nuclei and help hold the two atoms together,
making it a bonding orbital. For the out-of-phase combination, there are two nodal planes created, one along the
internuclear axis and a perpendicular one between the nuclei.
Figure 8.31 Side-by-side overlap of each two p orbitals results in the formation of two π molecular orbitals.
Combining the out-of-phase orbitals results in an antibonding molecular orbital with two nodes. One contains the
internuclear axis, and one is perpendicular to the axis. Combining the in-phase orbitals results in a bonding orbital.
There is a node (blue) containing the internuclear axis with the two lobes of the orbital located above and below this
node.
Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding 435
In the molecular orbitals of diatomic molecules, each atom also has two sets of p orbitals oriented side by side (py
and pz), so these four atomic orbitals combine pairwise to create two π orbitals and two π* orbitals. The πpy and π py*
orbitals are oriented at right angles to the πpz and π pz* orbitals. Except for their orientation, the πpy and πpz orbitals
are identical and have the same energy; they are degenerate orbitals. The π py* and π pz* antibonding orbitals are also
degenerate and identical except for their orientation. A total of six molecular orbitals results from the combination of
the six atomic p orbitals in two atoms: σpx and σ px* , πpy and π py* , πpz and π pz* .

Molecular Orbitals
Predict what type (if any) of molecular orbital would result from adding the wave functions so each pair of
orbitals shown overlap. The orbitals are all similar in energy.
Solution
(a) is an in-phase combination, resulting in a σ3p orbital
(b) will not result in a new orbital because the in-phase component (bottom) and out-of-phase component

Label the molecular orbital shown as σ or π, bonding or antibonding and indicate where the node occurs.
Answer: The orbital is located along the internuclear axis, so it is a σ orbital. There is a node bisecting the
internuclear axis, so it is an antibonding orbital.
Walter Kohn: Nobel Laureate
Walter Kohn (Figure 8.32) is a theoretical physicist who studies the electronic structure of solids. His work
combines the principles of quantum mechanics with advanced mathematical techniques. This technique, called
density functional theory, makes it possible to compute properties of molecular orbitals, including their shape
and energies. Kohn and mathematician John Pople were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1998 for
their contributions to our understanding of electronic structure. Kohn also made significant contributions to the

Kohn’s biography has been remarkable outside the realm of physical chemistry as well. He was born in Austria,
and during World War II he was part of the Kindertransport program that rescued 10,000 children from the Nazi
regime. His summer jobs included discovering gold deposits in Canada and helping Polaroid explain how its
instant film worked. Although he is now an emeritus professor, he is still actively working on projects involving
global warming and renewable energy.
Computational Chemistry in Drug Design
While the descriptions of bonding described in this chapter involve many theoretical concepts, they also
have many practical, real-world applications. For example, drug design is an important field that uses our
understanding of chemical bonding to develop pharmaceuticals. This interdisciplinary area of study uses
biology (understanding diseases and how they operate) to identify specific targets, such as a binding site
that is involved in a disease pathway. By modeling the structures of the binding site and potential drugs,
computational chemists can predict which structures can fit together and how effectively they will bind (see
Figure 8.33). Thousands of potential candidates can be narrowed down to a few of the most promising
candidates. These candidate molecules are then carefully tested to determine side effects, how effectively they
can be transported through the body, and other factors. Dozens of important new pharmaceuticals have been
discovered with the aid of computational chemistry, and new research projects are underway.

Molecular Orbital Energy Diagrams
The relative energy levels of atomic and molecular orbitals are typically shown in a molecular orbital diagram
(Figure 8.34). For a diatomic molecule, the atomic orbitals of one atom are shown on the left, and those of the
other atom are shown on the right. Each horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The
molecular orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center. Dashed lines show which
of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals. For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine, one
lower-energy (bonding) molecular orbital and one higher-energy (antibonding) orbital result. Thus we can see that
combining the six 2p atomic orbitals results in three bonding orbitals (one σ and two π) and three antibonding orbitals
(one σ* and two π*).
We predict the distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals by filling the orbitals in the same way that we
fill atomic orbitals, by the Aufbau principle. Lower-energy orbitals fill first, electrons spread out among degenerate
orbitals before pairing, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins (Figure 8.34).
Just as we write electron configurations for atoms, we can write the molecular electronic configuration by listing
the orbitals with superscripts indicating the number of electrons present. For clarity, we place parentheses around
molecular orbitals with the same energy. In this case, each orbital is at a different energy, so parentheses separate each
orbital. Thus we would expect a diatomic molecule or ion containing seven electrons (such as Be2 +) would have the
molecular electron configuration (σ1s)2 (σ1s* )2 (σ2s)2 (σ2s* )1. It is common to omit the core electrons from molecular
orbital diagrams and configurations and include only the valence electrons.

Figure 8.34 This is the molecular orbital diagram for the homonuclear diatomic Be2 +, showing the molecular
orbitals of the valence shell only. The molecular orbitals are filled in the same manner as atomic orbitals, using the
Aufbau principle and Hund’s rule.
Bond Order
The filled molecular orbital diagram shows the number of electrons in both bonding and antibonding molecular
orbitals. The net contribution of the electrons to the bond strength of a molecule is identified by determining the bond
order that results from the filling of the molecular orbitals by electrons.
When using Lewis structures to describe the distribution of electrons in molecules, we define bond order as the
number of bonding pairs of electrons between two atoms. Thus a single bond has a bond order of 1, a double bond
has a bond order of 2, and a triple bond has a bond order of 3. We define bond order differently when we use the
molecular orbital description of the distribution of electrons, but the resulting bond order is usually the same. The MO
technique is more accurate and can handle cases when the Lewis structure method fails, but both methods describe
the same phenomenon.
In the molecular orbital model, an electron contributes to a bonding interaction if it occupies a bonding orbital and
it contributes to an antibonding interaction if it occupies an antibonding orbital. The bond order is calculated by
subtracting the destabilizing (antibonding) electrons from the stabilizing (bonding) electrons. Since a bond consists
of two electrons, we divide by two to get the bond order. We can determine bond order with the following equation:
bond order = ⎛
⎝number of bonding electrons⎞
⎠ − ⎛
⎝number of antibonding electrons⎞
⎠
2
The order of a covalent bond is a guide to its strength; a bond between two given atoms becomes stronger as the
bond order increases (Table 8.1). If the distribution of electrons in the molecular orbitals between two atoms is such
that the resulting bond would have a bond order of zero, a stable bond does not form. We next look at some specific
Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding 439
examples of MO diagrams and bond orders.
Bonding in Diatomic Molecules
A dihydrogen molecule (H2) forms from two hydrogen atoms. When the atomic orbitals of the two atoms combine,
the electrons occupy the molecular orbital of lowest energy, the σ1s bonding orbital. A dihydrogen molecule, H2,
readily forms because the energy of a H2 molecule is lower than that of two H atoms. The σ1s orbital that contains
both electrons is lower in energy than either of the two 1s atomic orbitals.
A molecular orbital can hold two electrons, so both electrons in the H2 molecule are in the σ1s bonding orbital; the
electron configuration is (σ1s)2. We represent this configuration by a molecular orbital energy diagram (Figure
8.35) in which a single upward arrow indicates one electron in an orbital, and two (upward and downward) arrows
indicate two electrons of opposite spin.
Figure 8.35 The molecular orbital energy diagram predicts that H2 will be a stable molecule with lower energy than
the separated atoms.
A dihydrogen molecule contains two bonding electrons and no antibonding electrons so we have
bond order in H2 = (2 − 0)
2 = 1
Because the bond order for the H–H bond is equal to 1, the bond is a single bond.
A helium atom has two electrons, both of which are in its 1s orbital. Two helium atoms do not combine to form a
dihelium molecule, He2, with four electrons, because the stabilizing effect of the two electrons in the lower-energy
bonding orbital would be offset by the destabilizing effect of the two electrons in the higher-energy antibonding
molecular orbital. We would write the hypothetical electron configuration of He2 as (σ1s)2 (σ1s* )2 as in Figure 8.36.
The net energy change would be zero, so there is no driving force for helium atoms to form the diatomic molecule.
In fact, helium exists as discrete atoms rather than as diatomic molecules. The bond order in a hypothetical dihelium
molecule would be zero.
bond order in He2 = (2 − 2)
2 = 0
A bond order of zero indicates that no bond is formed between two atoms.

Figure 8.36 The molecular orbital energy diagram predicts that He2 will not be a stable molecule, since it has equal
numbers of bonding and antibonding electrons.
The Diatomic Molecules of the Second Period
Eight possible homonuclear diatomic molecules might be formed by the atoms of the second period of the periodic
table: Li2, Be2, B2, C2, N2, O2, F2, and Ne2. However, we can predict that the Be2 molecule and the Ne2 molecule
would not be stable. We can see this by a consideration of the molecular electron configurations (Table 8.3).
We predict valence molecular orbital electron configurations just as we predict electron configurations of atoms.
Valence electrons are assigned to valence molecular orbitals with the lowest possible energies. Consistent with Hund’s
rule, whenever there are two or more degenerate molecular orbitals, electrons fill each orbital of that type singly
before any pairing of electrons takes place.
As we saw in valence bond theory, σ bonds are generally more stable than π bonds formed from degenerate atomic
orbitals. Similarly, in molecular orbital theory, σ orbitals are usually more stable than π orbitals. However, this is
not always the case. The MOs for the valence orbitals of the second period are shown in Figure 8.37. Looking at
Ne2 molecular orbitals, we see that the order is consistent with the generic diagram shown in the previous section.
However, for atoms with three or fewer electrons in the p orbitals (Li through N) we observe a different pattern,
in which the σp orbital is higher in energy than the πp set. Obtain the molecular orbital diagram for a homonuclear
diatomic ion by adding or subtracting electrons from the diagram for the neutral molecule.
Chapter 8 | Advanced Theories of Covalent Bonding 441
Figure 8.37 This shows the MO diagrams for each homonuclear diatomic molecule in the second period. The orbital
energies decrease across the period as the effective nuclear charge increases and atomic radius decreases.
Between N2 and O2, the order of the orbitals changes.
You can practice labeling and filling molecular orbitals with this interactive tutorial
(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16labelorbital) from the University of Sydney.
This switch in orbital ordering occurs because of a phenomenon called s-p mixing. s-p mixing does not create new
orbitals; it merely influences the energies of the existing molecular orbitals. The σs wavefunction mathematically
combines with the σp wavefunction, with the result that the σs orbital becomes more stable, and the σp orbital becomes
less stable (Figure 8.38). Similarly, the antibonding orbitals also undergo s-p mixing, with the σs* becoming more
stable and the σp* becoming less stable.

Figure 8.38 Without mixing, the MO pattern occurs as expected, with the σp orbital lower in energy than the σp
orbitals. When s-p mixing occurs, the orbitals shift as shown, with the σp orbital higher in energy than the πp orbitals.
s-p mixing occurs when the s and p orbitals have similar energies. The energy difference between 2s and 2p orbitals in
O, F, and Neis greater than that in Li, Be, B, C, and N. Because of this, O2, F2, and Ne2 exhibit negligible s-p mixing
(not sufficient to change the energy ordering), and their MO diagrams follow the normal pattern, as shown in Figure
8.37. All of the other period 2 diatomic molecules do have s-p mixing, which leads to the pattern where the σp orbital
is raised above the πp set.
Using the MO diagrams shown in Figure 8.37, we can add in the electrons and determine the molecular electron
configuration and bond order for each of the diatomic molecules. As shown in Table 8.3, Be2 and Ne2 molecules
would have a bond order of 0, and these molecules do not exist.

Table 8.3
The combination of two lithium atoms to form a lithium molecule, Li2, is analogous to the formation of H2, but the
atomic orbitals involved are the valence 2s orbitals. Each of the two lithium atoms has one valence electron. Hence,
we have two valence electrons available for the σ2s bonding molecular orbital. Because both valence electrons would
be in a bonding orbital, we would predict the Li2 molecule to be stable. The molecule is, in fact, present in appreciable
concentration in lithium vapor at temperatures near the boiling point of the element. All of the other molecules in
Table 8.3 with a bond order greater than zero are also known.
The O2 molecule has enough electrons to half fill the ⎛
⎝π2py* , π2pz* ⎞
⎠ level. We expect the two electrons that occupy
these two degenerate orbitals to be unpaired, and this molecular electronic configuration for O2 is in accord with the
fact that the oxygen molecule has two unpaired electrons (Figure 8.40). The presence of two unpaired electrons has
proved to be difficult to explain using Lewis structures, but the molecular orbital theory explains it quite well. In fact,
the unpaired electrons of the oxygen molecule provide a strong piece of support for the molecular orbital theory.
Band Theory
When two identical atomic orbitals on different atoms combine, two molecular orbitals result (see Figure 8.29).
The bonding orbital is lower in energy than the original atomic orbitals because the atomic orbitals are in-phase
in the molecular orbital. The antibonding orbital is higher in energy than the original atomic orbitals because
the atomic orbitals are out-of-phase.
In a solid, similar things happen, but on a much larger scale. Remember that even in a small sample there
are a huge number of atoms (typically > 1023 atoms), and therefore a huge number of atomic orbitals that
may be combined into molecular orbitals. When N valence atomic orbitals, all of the same energy and each
containing one (1) electron, are combined, N/2 (filled) bonding orbitals and N/2 (empty) antibonding orbitals will
result. Each bonding orbital will show an energy lowering as the atomic orbitals are mostly in-phase, but each
of the bonding orbitals will be a little different and have slightly different energies. The antibonding orbitals will
show an increase in energy as the atomic orbitals are mostly out-of-phase, but each of the antibonding orbitals
will also be a little different and have slightly different energies. The allowed energy levels for all the bonding
orbitals are so close together that they form a band, called the valence band. Likewise, all the antibonding
orbitals are very close together and form a band, called the conduction band. Figure 8.39 shows the bands for
three important classes of materials: insulators, semiconductors, and conductors.

Figure 8.39 Molecular orbitals in solids are so closely spaced that they are described as bands. The valence
band is lower in energy and the conduction band is higher in energy. The type of solid is determined by the
size of the “band gap” between the valence and conduction bands. Only a very small amount of energy is
required to move electrons from the valence band to the conduction band in a conductor, and so they conduct
electricity well. In an insulator, the band gap is large, so that very few electrons move, and they are poor
conductors of electricity. Semiconductors are in between: they conduct electricity better than insulators, but
not as well as conductors.
In order to conduct electricity, electrons must move from the filled valence band to the empty conduction band
where they can move throughout the solid. The size of the band gap, or the energy difference between the
top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band, determines how easy it is to move electrons
between the bands. Only a small amount of energy is required in a conductor because the band gap is
very small. This small energy difference is “easy” to overcome, so they are good conductors of electricity. In
an insulator, the band gap is so “large” that very few electrons move into the conduction band; as a result,
insulators are poor conductors of electricity. Semiconductors conduct electricity when “moderate” amounts of
energy are provided to move electrons out of the valence band and into the conduction band. Semiconductors,
such as silicon, are found in many electronics.
Semiconductors are used in devices such as computers, smartphones, and solar cells. Solar cells produce
electricity when light provides the energy to move electrons out of the valence band. The electricity that is
generated may then be used to power a light or tool, or it can be stored for later use by charging a battery. As
of December 2014, up to 46% of the energy in sunlight could be converted into electricity using solar cells.

Summary
8.1 Valence Bond Theory
Valence bond theory describes bonding as a consequence of the overlap of two separate atomic orbitals on different
atoms that creates a region with one pair of electrons shared between the two atoms. When the orbitals overlap along
an axis containing the nuclei, they form a σ bond. When they overlap in a fashion that creates a node along this axis,
they form a π bond.
8.2 Hybrid Atomic Orbitals
We can use hybrid orbitals, which are mathematical combinations of some or all of the valence atomic orbitals, to
describe the electron density around covalently bonded atoms. These hybrid orbitals either form sigma (σ) bonds
directed toward other atoms of the molecule or contain lone pairs of electrons. We can determine the type of
hybridization around a central atom from the geometry of the regions of electron density about it. Two such regions
imply sp hybridization; three, sp2 hybridization; four, sp3 hybridization; five, sp3d hybridization; and six, sp3d2
hybridization. Pi (π) bonds are formed from unhybridized atomic orbitals (p or d orbitals).
8.3 Multiple Bonds
Multiple bonds consist of a σ bond located along the axis between two atoms and one or two π bonds. The σ bonds
are usually formed by the overlap of hybridized atomic orbitals, while the π bonds are formed by the side-by-side
overlap of unhybridized orbitals. Resonance occurs when there are multiple unhybridized orbitals with the appropriate
alignment to overlap, so the placement of π bonds can vary.
8.4 Molecular Orbital Theory
Molecular orbital (MO) theory describes the behavior of electrons in a molecule in terms of combinations of the
atomic wave functions. The resulting molecular orbitals may extend over all the atoms in the molecule. Bonding
molecular orbitals are formed by in-phase combinations of atomic wave functions, and electrons in these orbitals
stabilize a molecule. Antibonding molecular orbitals result from out-of-phase combinations of atomic wave functions
and electrons in these orbitals make a molecule less stable. Molecular orbitals located along an internuclear axis are
called σ MOs. They can be formed from s orbitals or from p orbitals oriented in an end-to-end fashion. Molecular
orbitals formed from p orbitals oriented in a side-by-side fashion have electron density on opposite sides of the

internuclear axis and are called π orbitals.
We can describe the electronic structure of diatomic molecules by applying molecular orbital theory to the valence
electrons of the atoms. Electrons fill molecular orbitals following the same rules that apply to filling atomic orbitals;
Hund’s rule and the Aufbau principle tell us that lower-energy orbitals will fill first, electrons will spread out before
they pair up, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins. Materials with unpaired
electrons are paramagnetic and attracted to a magnetic field, while those with all-paired electrons are diamagnetic and
repelled by a magnetic field. Correctly predicting the magnetic properties of molecules is in advantage of molecular
orbital theory over Lewis structures and valence bond theory.

Introduction
We are surrounded by an ocean of gas—the atmosphere—and many of the properties of gases are familiar to us from
our daily activities. Heated gases expand, which can make a hot air balloon rise (Figure 9.1) or cause a blowout in a
bicycle tire left in the sun on a hot day.
Gases have played an important part in the development of chemistry. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
many scientists investigated gas behavior, providing the first mathematical descriptions of the behavior of matter.
In this chapter, we will examine the relationships between gas temperature, pressure, amount, and volume. We will
study a simple theoretical model and use it to analyze the experimental behavior of gases. The results of these analyses
will show us the limitations of the theory and how to improve on it.

9.1 Gas Pressure
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define the property of pressure
• Define and convert among the units of pressure measurements
• Describe the operation of common tools for measuring gas pressure
• Calculate pressure from manometer data
The earth’s atmosphere exerts a pressure, as does any other gas. Although we do not normally notice atmospheric
pressure, we are sensitive to pressure changes—for example, when your ears “pop” during take-off and landing while
flying, or when you dive underwater. Gas pressure is caused by the force exerted by gas molecules colliding with
the surfaces of objects (Figure 9.2). Although the force of each collision is very small, any surface of appreciable
area experiences a large number of collisions in a short time, which can result in a high pressure. In fact, normal air
pressure is strong enough to crush a metal container when not balanced by equal pressure from inside the container.
Figure 9.2 The atmosphere above us exerts a large pressure on objects at the surface of the earth, roughly equal to
the weight of a bowling ball pressing on an area the size of a human thumbnail.
A dramatic illustration (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16atmospressur1) of atmospheric pressure is
provided in this brief video, which shows a railway tanker car imploding when its internal pressure is
decreased.
A smaller scale demonstration (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16atmospressur2) of this phenomenon is
briefly explained.
Atmospheric pressure is caused by the weight of the column of air molecules in the atmosphere above an object,
such as the tanker car. At sea level, this pressure is roughly the same as that exerted by a full-grown African elephant
standing on a doormat, or a typical bowling ball resting on your thumbnail. These may seem like huge amounts, and
they are, but life on earth has evolved under such atmospheric pressure. If you actually perch a bowling ball on your
thumbnail, the pressure experienced is twice the usual pressure, and the sensation is unpleasant.

In general, pressure is defined as the force exerted on a given area: P = F
A. Note that pressure is directly
proportional to force and inversely proportional to area. Thus, pressure can be increased either by increasing the
amount of force or by decreasing the area over which it is applied; pressure can be decreased by decreasing the force
or increasing the area.
Let’s apply this concept to determine which would be more likely to fall through thin ice in Figure 9.3—the elephant
or the figure skater? A large African elephant can weigh 7 tons, supported on four feet, each with a diameter of about
1.5 ft (footprint area of 250 in2), so the pressure exerted by each foot is about 14 lb/in2:
pressure per elephant foot = 14,000 lb
elephant × 1 elephant
4 feet × 1 foot
250 in2 = 14 lb/in2
The figure skater weighs about 120 lbs, supported on two skate blades, each with an area of about 2 in2, so the
pressure exerted by each blade is about 30 lb/in2:
pressure per skate blade = 120 lb
skater × 1 skater
2 blades × 1 blade
2 in2 = 30 lb/in2
Even though the elephant is more than one hundred-times heavier than the skater, it exerts less than one-half of the
pressure and would therefore be less likely to fall though thin ice. On the other hand, if the skater removes her skates
and stands with bare feet (or regular footwear) on the ice, the larger area over which her weight is applied greatly
reduces the pressure exerted:
pressure per human foot = 120 lb
skater × 1 skater
2 feet × 1 foot
30 in2 = 2 lb/in2
Figure 9.3 Although (a) an elephant’s weight is large, creating a very large force on the ground, (b) the figure skater
exerts a much higher pressure on the ice due to the small surface area of her skates. (credit a: modification of work
by Guido da Rozze; credit b: modification of work by Ryosuke Yagi)
The SI unit of pressure is the pascal (Pa), with 1 Pa = 1 N/m2, where N is the newton, a unit of force defined as 1
kg m/s2. One pascal is a small pressure; in many cases, it is more convenient to use units of kilopascal (1 kPa = 1000
Pa) or bar (1 bar = 100,000 Pa). In the United States, pressure is often measured in pounds of force on an area of
one square inch—pounds per square inch (psi)—for example, in car tires. Pressure can also be measured using the
unit atmosphere (atm), which originally represented the average sea level air pressure at the approximate latitude of
Paris (45°). Table 9.1 provides some information on these and a few other common units for pressure measurements

We can measure atmospheric pressure, the force exerted by the atmosphere on the earth’s surface, with a barometer
(Figure 9.4). A barometer is a glass tube that is closed at one end, filled with a nonvolatile liquid such as mercury,
and then inverted and immersed in a container of that liquid. The atmosphere exerts pressure on the liquid outside
the tube, the column of liquid exerts pressure inside the tube, and the pressure at the liquid surface is the same inside
and outside the tube. The height of the liquid in the tube is therefore proportional to the pressure exerted by the
atmosphere.
Figure 9.4 In a barometer, the height, h, of the column of liquid is used as a measurement of the air pressure. Using
very dense liquid mercury (left) permits the construction of reasonably sized barometers, whereas using water (right)
would require a barometer more than 30 feet tall.
If the liquid is water, normal atmospheric pressure will support a column of water over 10 meters high, which is rather
inconvenient for making (and reading) a barometer. Because mercury (Hg) is about 13.6-times denser than water, a
mercury barometer only needs to be 1
13.6 as tall as a water barometer—a more suitable size. Standard atmospheric
pressure of 1 atm at sea level (101,325 Pa) corresponds to a column of mercury that is about 760 mm (29.92 in.) high.
The torr was originally intended to be a unit equal to one millimeter of mercury, but it no longer corresponds exactly.
The pressure exerted by a fluid due to gravity is known as hydrostatic pressure, p:
p = hρg
where h is the height of the fluid, ρ is the density of the fluid, and g is acceleration due to gravity.
Example 9.2
Calculation of Barometric Pressure
Show the calculation supporting the claim that atmospheric pressure near sea level corresponds to the
pressure exerted by a column of mercury that is about 760 mm high. The density of mercury = 13.6 g/cm3.
Solution
The hydrostatic pressure is given by p = hρg, with h = 760 mm, ρ = 13.6 g/cm3, and g = 9.81 m/s2. Plugging
these values into the equation and doing the necessary unit conversions will give us the value we seek.

Answer: 10.3 m
A manometer is a device similar to a barometer that can be used to measure the pressure of a gas trapped in a
container. A closed-end manometer is a U-shaped tube with one closed arm, one arm that connects to the gas to
be measured, and a nonvolatile liquid (usually mercury) in between. As with a barometer, the distance between the
liquid levels in the two arms of the tube (h in the diagram) is proportional to the pressure of the gas in the container.
An open-end manometer (Figure 9.5) is the same as a closed-end manometer, but one of its arms is open to the
atmosphere. In this case, the distance between the liquid levels corresponds to the difference in pressure between the
gas in the container and the atmosphere.
Figure 9.5 A manometer can be used to measure the pressure of a gas. The (difference in) height between the
liquid levels (h) is a measure of the pressure. Mercury is usually used because of its large density.

Measuring Blood Pressure
Blood pressure is measured using a device called a sphygmomanometer (Greek sphygmos = “pulse”). It
consists of an inflatable cuff to restrict blood flow, a manometer to measure the pressure, and a method of
determining when blood flow begins and when it becomes impeded (Figure 9.6). Since its invention in 1881,
it has been an essential medical device. There are many types of sphygmomanometers: manual ones that
require a stethoscope and are used by medical professionals; mercury ones, used when the most accuracy
is required; less accurate mechanical ones; and digital ones that can be used with little training but that have
limitations. When using a sphygmomanometer, the cuff is placed around the upper arm and inflated until blood
flow is completely blocked, then slowly released. As the heart beats, blood forced through the arteries causes
a rise in pressure. This rise in pressure at which blood flow begins is the systolic pressure—the peak pressure
in the cardiac cycle. When the cuff’s pressure equals the arterial systolic pressure, blood flows past the cuff,
creating audible sounds that can be heard using a stethoscope. This is followed by a decrease in pressure
as the heart’s ventricles prepare for another beat. As cuff pressure continues to decrease, eventually sound is
no longer heard; this is the diastolic pressure—the lowest pressure (resting phase) in the cardiac cycle. Blood
pressure units from a sphygmomanometer are in terms of millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).
Figure 9.6 (a) A medical technician prepares to measure a patient’s blood pressure with a
sphygmomanometer. (b) A typical sphygmomanometer uses a valved rubber bulb to inflate the cuff and a

Meteorology, Climatology, and Atmospheric Science
Throughout the ages, people have observed clouds, winds, and precipitation, trying to discern patterns and
make predictions: when it is best to plant and harvest; whether it is safe to set out on a sea voyage; and
much more. We now face complex weather and atmosphere-related challenges that will have a major impact
on our civilization and the ecosystem. Several different scientific disciplines use chemical principles to help us
better understand weather, the atmosphere, and climate. These are meteorology, climatology, and atmospheric
science. Meteorology is the study of the atmosphere, atmospheric phenomena, and atmospheric effects on
earth’s weather. Meteorologists seek to understand and predict the weather in the short term, which can save
lives and benefit the economy. Weather forecasts (Figure 9.7) are the result of thousands of measurements
of air pressure, temperature, and the like, which are compiled, modeled, and analyzed in weather centers
worldwide.

Figure 9.7 Meteorologists use weather maps to describe and predict weather. Regions of high (H) and low
(L) pressure have large effects on weather conditions. The gray lines represent locations of constant pressure
known as isobars. (credit: modification of work by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)
In terms of weather, low-pressure systems occur when the earth’s surface atmospheric pressure is lower than
the surrounding environment: Moist air rises and condenses, producing clouds. Movement of moisture and air
within various weather fronts instigates most weather events.
The atmosphere is the gaseous layer that surrounds a planet. Earth’s atmosphere, which is roughly 100–125
km thick, consists of roughly 78.1% nitrogen and 21.0% oxygen, and can be subdivided further into the regions
shown in Figure 9.8: the exosphere (furthest from earth, > 700 km above sea level), the thermosphere (80–700
km), the mesosphere (50–80 km), the stratosphere (second lowest level of our atmosphere, 12–50 km above
sea level), and the troposphere (up to 12 km above sea level, roughly 80% of the earth’s atmosphere by mass
and the layer where most weather events originate). As you go higher in the troposphere, air density and
temperature both decrease.
Figure 9.8 Earth’s atmosphere has five layers: the troposphere, the stratosphere, the mesosphere, the
thermosphere, and the exosphere.
Climatology is the study of the climate, averaged weather conditions over long time periods, using atmospheric
data. However, climatologists study patterns and effects that occur over decades, centuries, and millennia,

rather than shorter time frames of hours, days, and weeks like meteorologists. Atmospheric science is an even
broader field, combining meteorology, climatology, and other scientific disciplines that study the atmosphere.
9.2 Relating Pressure, Volume, Amount, and Temperature:
The Ideal Gas Law
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Identify the mathematical relationships between the various properties of gases
• Use the ideal gas law, and related gas laws, to compute the values of various gas properties under specified
conditions
During the seventeenth and especially eighteenth centuries, driven both by a desire to understand nature and a quest
to make balloons in which they could fly (Figure 9.9), a number of scientists established the relationships between
the macroscopic physical properties of gases, that is, pressure, volume, temperature, and amount of gas. Although
their measurements were not precise by today’s standards, they were able to determine the mathematical relationships
between pairs of these variables (e.g., pressure and temperature, pressure and volume) that hold for an ideal gas—a
hypothetical construct that real gases approximate under certain conditions. Eventually, these individual laws were
combined into a single equation—the ideal gas law—that relates gas quantities for gases and is quite accurate for
low pressures and moderate temperatures. We will consider the key developments in individual relationships (for
pedagogical reasons not quite in historical order), then put them together in the ideal gas law.
Figure 9.9 In 1783, the first (a) hydrogen-filled balloon flight, (b) manned hot air balloon flight, and (c) manned
hydrogen-filled balloon flight occurred. When the hydrogen-filled balloon depicted in (a) landed, the frightened
villagers of Gonesse reportedly destroyed it with pitchforks and knives. The launch of the latter was reportedly viewed
by 400,000 people in Paris.
Pressure and Temperature: Amontons’s Law
Imagine filling a rigid container attached to a pressure gauge with gas and then sealing the container so that no gas
may escape. If the container is cooled, the gas inside likewise gets colder and its pressure is observed to decrease.
Since the container is rigid and tightly sealed, both the volume and number of moles of gas remain constant. If we
heat the sphere, the gas inside gets hotter (Figure 9.10) and the pressure increases.
Chapter 9 | Gases 467
Figure 9.10 The effect of temperature on gas pressure: When the hot plate is off, the pressure of the gas in the
sphere is relatively low. As the gas is heated, the pressure of the gas in the sphere increases.
This relationship between temperature and pressure is observed for any sample of gas confined to a constant volume.
An example of experimental pressure-temperature data is shown for a sample of air under these conditions in Figure
9.11. We find that temperature and pressure are linearly related, and if the temperature is on the kelvin scale, then P
and T are directly proportional (again, when volume and moles of gas are held constant); if the temperature on the
kelvin scale increases by a certain factor, the gas pressure increases by the same factor.
Figure 9.11 For a constant volume and amount of air, the pressure and temperature are directly proportional,
provided the temperature is in kelvin. (Measurements cannot be made at lower temperatures because of the
condensation of the gas.) When this line is extrapolated to lower pressures, it reaches a pressure of 0 at –273 °C,
which is 0 on the kelvin scale and the lowest possible temperature, called absolute zero.
Guillaume Amontons was the first to empirically establish the relationship between the pressure and the temperature
of a gas (~1700), and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac determined the relationship more precisely (~1800). Because of this,
the P-T relationship for gases is known as either Amontons’s law or Gay-Lussac’s law. Under either name, it states
that the pressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its temperature on the kelvin scale when the
volume is held constant. Mathematically, this can be written:
468 Chapter 9 | Gases
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
P ∝ T or P = constant × T or P = k × T
where ∝ means “is proportional to,” and k is a proportionality constant that depends on the identity, amount, and
volume of the gas.
For a confined, constant volume of gas, the ratio P
T is therefore constant (i.e., P
T = k ). If the gas is initially in
“Condition 1” (with P = P1 and T = T1), and then changes to “Condition 2” (with P = P2 and T = T2), we have that
P1
T1
= k and P2
T2
= k, which reduces to P1
T1
= P2
T2
. This equation is useful for pressure-temperature calculations
for a confined gas at constant volume. Note that temperatures must be on the kelvin scale for any gas law calculations
(0 on the kelvin scale and the lowest possible temperature is called absolute zero). (Also note that there are at least
three ways we can describe how the pressure of a gas changes as its temperature changes: We can use a table of
values, a graph, or a mathematical equation.)
Example 9.5
Predicting Change in Pressure with Temperature
A can of hair spray is used until it is empty except for the propellant, isobutane gas.
(a) On the can is the warning “Store only at temperatures below 120 °F (48.8 °C). Do not incinerate.” Why?
(b) The gas in the can is initially at 24 °C and 360 kPa, and the can has a volume of 350 mL. If the can is
left in a car that reaches 50 °C on a hot day, what is the new pressure in the can?
Solution
(a) The can contains an amount of isobutane gas at a constant volume, so if the temperature is increased by
heating, the pressure will increase proportionately. High temperature could lead to high pressure, causing
the can to burst. (Also, isobutane is combustible, so incineration could cause the can to explode.)
(b) We are looking for a pressure change due to a temperature change at constant volume, so we will use
Amontons’s/Gay-Lussac’s law. Taking P1 and T1 as the initial values, T2 as the temperature where the
pressure is unknown and P2 as the unknown pressure, and converting °C to K, we have:
P1
T1
= P2
T2
which means that 360 kPa
297 K = P2
323 K
Rearranging and solving gives: P2 = 360 kPa × 323 K
297 K = 390 kPa

Volume and Temperature: Charles’s Law
If we fill a balloon with air and seal it, the balloon contains a specific amount of air at atmospheric pressure, let’s
say 1 atm. If we put the balloon in a refrigerator, the gas inside gets cold and the balloon shrinks (although both the
amount of gas and its pressure remain constant). If we make the balloon very cold, it will shrink a great deal, and it
expands again when it warms up.
Chapter 9 | Gases 469
This video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16CharlesLaw) shows how cooling and heating a gas causes
its volume to decrease or increase, respectively.
These examples of the effect of temperature on the volume of a given amount of a confined gas at constant pressure
are true in general: The volume increases as the temperature increases, and decreases as the temperature decreases.
Volume-temperature data for a 1-mole sample of methane gas at 1 atm are listed and graphed in Figure 9.12.
Figure 9.12 The volume and temperature are linearly related for 1 mole of methane gas at a constant pressure of 1
atm. If the temperature is in kelvin, volume and temperature are directly proportional. The line stops at 111 K because
methane liquefies at this temperature; when extrapolated, it intersects the graph’s origin, representing a temperature
of absolute zero.
The relationship between the volume and temperature of a given amount of gas at constant pressure is known as
Charles’s law in recognition of the French scientist and balloon flight pioneer Jacques Alexandre César Charles.
Charles’s law states that the volume of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its temperature on the kelvin
scale when the pressure is held constant.
Mathematically, this can be written as:
V α T or V = constant·T or V = k·T or V1 /T1 = V2 /T2
with k being a proportionality constant that depends on the amount and pressure of the gas.
For a confined, constant pressure gas sample, V
T is constant (i.e., the ratio = k), and as seen with the P-T relationship,
this leads to another form of Charles’s law: V1
T1
= V2
T2
.

Solution
Because we are looking for the volume change caused by a temperature change at constant pressure, this is
a job for Charles’s law. Taking V1 and T1 as the initial values, T2 as the temperature at which the volume is
unknown and V2 as the unknown volume, and converting °C into K we have:
V1
T1
= V2
T2
which means that 0.300 L
283 K = V2
303 K
Rearranging and solving gives: V2 = 0.300 L × 303 K
283 K = 0.321 L
This answer supports our expectation from Charles’s law, namely, that raising the gas temperature (from
283 K to 303 K) at a constant pressure will yield an increase in its volume (from 0.300 L to 0.321 L).

Example 9.7
Measuring Temperature with a Volume Change
Temperature is sometimes measured with a gas thermometer by observing the change in the volume of the
gas as the temperature changes at constant pressure. The hydrogen in a particular hydrogen gas thermometer
has a volume of 150.0 cm3 when immersed in a mixture of ice and water (0.00 °C). When immersed
in boiling liquid ammonia, the volume of the hydrogen, at the same pressure, is 131.7 cm3. Find the
temperature of boiling ammonia on the kelvin and Celsius scales.
Solution
A volume change caused by a temperature change at constant pressure means we should use Charles’s law.
Taking V1 and T1 as the initial values, T2 as the temperature at which the volume is unknown and V2 as the
unknown volume, and converting °C into K we have:
V1
T1
= V2
T2
which means that 150.0 cm3
273.15 K = 131.7 cm3
T2
Rearrangement gives T2 = 131.7 cm 3 × 273.15 K
150.0 cm 3 = 239.8 K
Subtracting 273.15 from 239.8 K, we find that the temperature of the boiling ammonia on the Celsius scale
is –33.4 °C.

Volume and Pressure: Boyle’s Law
If we partially fill an airtight syringe with air, the syringe contains a specific amount of air at constant temperature, say
25 °C. If we slowly push in the plunger while keeping temperature constant, the gas in the syringe is compressed into a
smaller volume and its pressure increases; if we pull out the plunger, the volume increases and the pressure decreases.
This example of the effect of volume on the pressure of a given amount of a confined gas is true in general. Decreasing
the volume of a contained gas will increase its pressure, and increasing its volume will decrease its pressure. In fact,
Chapter 9 | Gases 471
if the volume increases by a certain factor, the pressure decreases by the same factor, and vice versa. Volume-pressure
data for an air sample at room temperature are graphed in Figure 9.13.
Figure 9.13 When a gas occupies a smaller volume, it exerts a higher pressure; when it occupies a larger volume, it
exerts a lower pressure (assuming the amount of gas and the temperature do not change). Since P and V are
inversely proportional, a graph of 1
P vs. V is linear.
Unlike the P-T and V-T relationships, pressure and volume are not directly proportional to each other. Instead, P and V
exhibit inverse proportionality: Increasing the pressure results in a decrease of the volume of the gas. Mathematically
this can be written:
P α 1/V or P = k·1/V or P·V = k or P1 V1 = P2 V2
with k being a constant. Graphically, this relationship is shown by the straight line that results when plotting the
inverse of the pressure ⎛
⎝1
P
⎞
⎠ versus the volume (V), or the inverse of volume ⎛
⎝ 1
V
⎞
⎠ versus the pressure (P). Graphs
with curved lines are difficult to read accurately at low or high values of the variables, and they are more difficult to
use in fitting theoretical equations and parameters to experimental data. For those reasons, scientists often try to find
a way to “linearize” their data. If we plot P versus V, we obtain a hyperbola (see Figure 9.14).

The relationship between the volume and pressure of a given amount of gas at constant temperature was first
published by the English natural philosopher Robert Boyle over 300 years ago. It is summarized in the statement now
known as Boyle’s law: The volume of a given amount of gas held at constant temperature is inversely proportional to
the pressure under which it is measured.
Example 9.8
Volume of a Gas Sample
The sample of gas in Figure 9.13 has a volume of 15.0 mL at a pressure of 13.0 psi. Determine the pressure
of the gas at a volume of 7.5 mL, using:
(a) the P-V graph in Figure 9.13
(b) the 1
P vs. V graph in Figure 9.13
(c) the Boyle’s law equation
Comment on the likely accuracy of each method.
Solution
(a) Estimating from the P-V graph gives a value for P somewhere around 27 psi.
(b) Estimating from the 1
P versus V graph give a value of about 26 psi.
(c) From Boyle’s law, we know that the product of pressure and volume (PV) for a given sample of gas at
a constant temperature is always equal to the same value. Therefore we have P1V1 = k and P2V2 = k which
means that P1V1 = P2V2.
Using P1 and V1 as the known values 13.0 psi and 15.0 mL, P2 as the pressure at which the volume is
unknown, and V2 as the unknown volume, we have:
P1 V1 = P2 V2 or 13.0 psi × 15.0 mL = P2 × 7.5 mL
Solving:
P2 = 13.0 psi × 15.0 mL
7.5 mL = 26 psi
It was more difficult to estimate well from the P-V graph, so (a) is likely more inaccurate than (b) or (c).
The calculation will be as accurate as the equation and measurements allow.

Breathing and Boyle’s Law
What do you do about 20 times per minute for your whole life, without break, and often without even being
aware of it? The answer, of course, is respiration, or breathing. How does it work? It turns out that the gas laws
apply here. Your lungs take in gas that your body needs (oxygen) and get rid of waste gas (carbon dioxide).
Lungs are made of spongy, stretchy tissue that expands and contracts while you breathe. When you inhale,
your diaphragm and intercostal muscles (the muscles between your ribs) contract, expanding your chest cavity
and making your lung volume larger. The increase in volume leads to a decrease in pressure (Boyle’s law).
This causes air to flow into the lungs (from high pressure to low pressure). When you exhale, the process
reverses: Your diaphragm and rib muscles relax, your chest cavity contracts, and your lung volume decreases,
causing the pressure to increase (Boyle’s law again), and air flows out of the lungs (from high pressure to low
pressure). You then breathe in and out again, and again, repeating this Boyle’s law cycle for the rest of your
life (Figure 9.15).

Figure 9.15 Breathing occurs because expanding and contracting lung volume creates small pressure
differences between your lungs and your surroundings, causing air to be drawn into and forced out of your
lungs.
Moles of Gas and Volume: Avogadro’s Law
The Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro advanced a hypothesis in 1811 to account for the behavior of gases, stating
that equal volumes of all gases, measured under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, contain the same
number of molecules. Over time, this relationship was supported by many experimental observations as expressed by
Avogadro’s law: For a confined gas, the volume (V) and number of moles (n) are directly proportional if the pressure
and temperature both remain constant.
In equation form, this is written as:
V ∝ n or V = k × n or V1
n1 = V2
n2
Mathematical relationships can also be determined for the other variable pairs, such as P versus n, and n versus T.
Chapter 9 | Gases 475
Visit this interactive PhET simulation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16IdealGasLaw) to investigate the
relationships between pressure, volume, temperature, and amount of gas. Use the simulation to examine
the effect of changing one parameter on another while holding the other parameters constant (as
described in the preceding sections on the various gas laws).
The Ideal Gas Law
To this point, four separate laws have been discussed that relate pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of
moles of the gas:
• Boyle’s law: PV = constant at constant T and n
• Amontons’s law: P
T = constant at constant V and n
• Charles’s law: V
T = constant at constant P and n
• Avogadro’s law: V
n = constant at constant P and T
Combining these four laws yields the ideal gas law, a relation between the pressure, volume, temperature, and
number of moles of a gas:
PV = nRT
where P is the pressure of a gas, V is its volume, n is the number of moles of the gas, T is its temperature on the
kelvin scale, and R is a constant called the ideal gas constant or the universal gas constant. The units used to express
pressure, volume, and temperature will determine the proper form of the gas constant as required by dimensional
analysis, the most commonly encountered values being 0.08206 L atm mol–1 K–1 and 8.314 kPa L mol–1 K–1.
Gases whose properties of P, V, and T are accurately described by the ideal gas law (or the other gas laws) are said
to exhibit ideal behavior or to approximate the traits of an ideal gas. An ideal gas is a hypothetical construct that
may be used along with kinetic molecular theory to effectively explain the gas laws as will be described in a later
module of this chapter. Although all the calculations presented in this module assume ideal behavior, this assumption
is only reasonable for gases under conditions of relatively low pressure and high temperature. In the final module of
this chapter, a modified gas law will be introduced that accounts for the non-ideal behavior observed for many gases
at relatively high pressures and low temperatures.
The ideal gas equation contains five terms, the gas constant R and the variable properties P, V, n, and T. Specifying
any four of these terms will permit use of the ideal gas law to calculate the fifth term as demonstrated in the following
example exercises.

It requires a large container to hold enough methane at 1 atm to replace several gallons of gasoline.

The Interdependence between Ocean Depth and Pressure in Scuba Diving
Whether scuba diving at the Great Barrier Reef in Australia (shown in Figure 9.17) or in the Caribbean, divers
must understand how pressure affects a number of issues related to their comfort and safety.
Figure 9.17 Scuba divers, whether at the Great Barrier Reef or in the Caribbean, must be aware of
buoyancy, pressure equalization, and the amount of time they spend underwater, to avoid the risks
associated with pressurized gases in the body. (credit: Kyle Taylor)
Pressure increases with ocean depth, and the pressure changes most rapidly as divers reach the surface. The
pressure a diver experiences is the sum of all pressures above the diver (from the water and the air). Most
pressure measurements are given in units of atmospheres, expressed as “atmospheres absolute” or ATA in
the diving community: Every 33 feet of salt water represents 1 ATA of pressure in addition to 1 ATA of pressure

from the atmosphere at sea level. As a diver descends, the increase in pressure causes the body’s air pockets
in the ears and lungs to compress; on the ascent, the decrease in pressure causes these air pockets to expand,
potentially rupturing eardrums or bursting the lungs. Divers must therefore undergo equalization by adding air
to body airspaces on the descent by breathing normally and adding air to the mask by breathing out of the
nose or adding air to the ears and sinuses by equalization techniques; the corollary is also true on ascent,
divers must release air from the body to maintain equalization. Buoyancy, or the ability to control whether a
diver sinks or floats, is controlled by the buoyancy compensator (BCD). If a diver is ascending, the air in his
BCD expands because of lower pressure according to Boyle’s law (decreasing the pressure of gases increases
the volume). The expanding air increases the buoyancy of the diver, and she or he begins to ascend. The
diver must vent air from the BCD or risk an uncontrolled ascent that could rupture the lungs. In descending,
the increased pressure causes the air in the BCD to compress and the diver sinks much more quickly; the
diver must add air to the BCD or risk an uncontrolled descent, facing much higher pressures near the ocean
floor. The pressure also impacts how long a diver can stay underwater before ascending. The deeper a diver
dives, the more compressed the air that is breathed because of increased pressure: If a diver dives 33 feet,
the pressure is 2 ATA and the air would be compressed to one-half of its original volume. The diver uses up
available air twice as fast as at the surface.
Standard Conditions of Temperature and Pressure
We have seen that the volume of a given quantity of gas and the number of molecules (moles) in a given volume
of gas vary with changes in pressure and temperature. Chemists sometimes make comparisons against a standard
temperature and pressure (STP) for reporting properties of gases: 273.15 K and 1 atm (101.325 kPa).[1] At STP,
one mole of an ideal gas has a volume of about 22.4 L—this is referred to as the standard molar volume (Figure
9.18).
1. The IUPAC definition of standard pressure was changed from 1 atm to 1 bar (100 kPa) in 1982, but the prior definition remains in use by
many literature resources and will be used in this text.

The study of the chemical behavior of gases was part of the basis of perhaps the most fundamental chemical
revolution in history. French nobleman Antoine Lavoisier, widely regarded as the “father of modern chemistry,”
changed chemistry from a qualitative to a quantitative science through his work with gases. He discovered the law
of conservation of matter, discovered the role of oxygen in combustion reactions, determined the composition of
air, explained respiration in terms of chemical reactions, and more. He was a casualty of the French Revolution,
guillotined in 1794. Of his death, mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange said, “It took the mob only
a moment to remove his head; a century will not suffice to reproduce it.”[2]
As described in an earlier chapter of this text, we can turn to chemical stoichiometry for answers to many of the
questions that ask “How much?” The essential property involved in such use of stoichiometry is the amount of
substance, typically measured in moles (n). For gases, molar amount can be derived from convenient experimental
measurements of pressure, temperature, and volume. Therefore, these measurements are useful in assessing the
stoichiometry of pure gases, gas mixtures, and chemical reactions involving gases. This section will not introduce any

Gas Density and Molar Mass
The ideal gas law described previously in this chapter relates the properties of pressure P, volume V, temperature T,
and molar amount n. This law is universal, relating these properties in identical fashion regardless of the chemical
identity of the gas:
PV = nRT
The density d of a gas, on the other hand, is determined by its identity. As described in another chapter of this text,
the density of a substance is a characteristic property that may be used to identify the substance.
d = m
V
Rearranging the ideal gas equation to isolate V and substituting into the density equation yields
d = mP
nRT = ⎛
⎝m
n ⎞
⎠ P
RT
The ratio m/n is the definition of molar mass, ℳ:
ℳ = m
n
The density equation can then be written
d = ℳP
RT
This relation may be used for calculating the densities of gases of known identities at specified values of pressure and
temperature as demonstrated in Example 9.11.

Measuring Gas Density
What is the density of molecular nitrogen gas at STP?
Solution
The molar mass of molecular nitrogen, N2, is 28.01 g/mol. Substituting this value along with standard
temperature and pressure into the gas density equation yields

Answer: d = 0.0847 g/L
When the identity of a gas is unknown, measurements of the mass, pressure, volume, and temperature of a sample
can be used to calculate the molar mass of the gas (a useful property for identification purposes). Combining the ideal
gas equation
PV = nRT
and the definition of molarity
ℳ = m
n
yields the following equation:

Determining the molar mass of a gas via this approach is demonstrated in Example 9.12.

Determining the Molecular Formula of a Gas from its Molar Mass and
Empirical Formula
Cyclopropane, a gas once used with oxygen as a general anesthetic, is composed of 85.7% carbon and
14.3% hydrogen by mass. Find the empirical formula. If 1.56 g of cyclopropane occupies a volume of 1.00
L at 0.984 atm and 50 °C, what is the molecular formula for cyclopropane?
Solution
First determine the empirical formula of the gas. Assume 100 g and convert the percentage of each element
into grams. Determine the number of moles of carbon and hydrogen in the 100-g sample of cyclopropane.
Divide by the smallest number of moles to relate the number of moles of carbon to the number of moles of
hydrogen. In the last step, realize that the smallest whole number ratio is the empirical formula:
85.7 g C × 1 mol C
12.01 g C = 7.136 mol C 7.136
7.136 = 1.00 mol C
14.3 g H × 1 mol H
1.01 g H = 14.158 mol H 14.158
7.136 = 1.98 mol H
Empirical formula is CH2 [empirical mass (EM) of 14.03 g/empirical unit].
Next, use the provided values for mass, pressure, temperature and volume to compute the molar mass of the
gas:
ℳ = mRT
PV = (1.56 g)(0.0821 L·atm·mol−1 K−1)(323 K)
(0.984 atm)(1.00 L) = 42.0 g/mol
Comparing the molar mass to the empirical formula mass shows how many empirical formula units make
up a molecule:
ℳ
EM = 42.0 g/mol
14.0 g/mol = 3
The molecular formula is thus derived from the empirical formula by multiplying each of its subscripts by
three:
(CH2)3 = C3 H6

Determining the Molar Mass of a Volatile Liquid
The approximate molar mass of a volatile liquid can be determined by:
1. Heating a sample of the liquid in a flask with a tiny hole at the top, which converts the liquid into
gas that may escape through the hole

2. Removing the flask from heat at the instant when the last bit of liquid becomes gas, at which time
the flask will be filled with only gaseous sample at ambient pressure
3. Sealing the flask and permitting the gaseous sample to condense to liquid, and then weighing the
flask to determine the sample’s mass (see Figure 9.19)
Figure 9.19 When the volatile liquid in the flask is heated past its boiling point, it becomes gas and drives
air out of the flask. At tl ⟶ g, the flask is filled with volatile liquid gas at the same pressure as the
atmosphere. If the flask is then cooled to room temperature, the gas condenses and the mass of the gas
that filled the flask, and is now liquid, can be measured. (credit: modification of work by Mark Ott)
Using this procedure, a sample of chloroform gas weighing 0.494 g is collected in a flask with a volume of
129 cm3 at 99.6 °C when the atmospheric pressure is 742.1 mm Hg. What is the approximate molar mass of
chloroform?
Solution
Since ℳ = m
n and n = PV
RT , substituting and rearranging gives ℳ = mRT

then
ℳ = mRT
PV = ⎛

The Pressure of a Mixture of Gases: Dalton’s Law
Unless they chemically react with each other, the individual gases in a mixture of gases do not affect each other’s
pressure. Each individual gas in a mixture exerts the same pressure that it would exert if it were present alone in the
container (Figure 9.20). The pressure exerted by each individual gas in a mixture is called its partial pressure. This
observation is summarized by Dalton’s law of partial pressures: The total pressure of a mixture of ideal gases is
equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the component gases:
PTotal = P A + PB + PC + ... = Σi Pi
In the equation PTotal is the total pressure of a mixture of gases, PA is the partial pressure of gas A; PB is the partial
pressure of gas B; PC is the partial pressure of gas C; and so on.
Chapter 9 | Gases 483
Figure 9.20 If equal-volume cylinders containing gas A at a pressure of 300 kPa, gas B at a pressure of 600 kPa,
and gas C at a pressure of 450 kPa are all combined in the same-size cylinder, the total pressure of the mixture is
1350 kPa.
The partial pressure of gas A is related to the total pressure of the gas mixture via its mole fraction (X), a unit of
concentration defined as the number of moles of a component of a solution divided by the total number of moles of
all components:
P A = X A × PTotal where X A = n A
nTotal
where PA, XA, and nA are the partial pressure, mole fraction, and number of moles of gas A, respectively, and nTotal is
the number of moles of all components in the mixture.

Collection of Gases over Water
A simple way to collect gases that do not react with water is to capture them in a bottle that has been filled with
water and inverted into a dish filled with water. The pressure of the gas inside the bottle can be made equal to the air
pressure outside by raising or lowering the bottle. When the water level is the same both inside and outside the bottle
(Figure 9.21), the pressure of the gas is equal to the atmospheric pressure, which can be measured with a barometer.
Figure 9.21 When a reaction produces a gas that is collected above water, the trapped gas is a mixture of the gas
produced by the reaction and water vapor. If the collection flask is appropriately positioned to equalize the water
levels both within and outside the flask, the pressure of the trapped gas mixture will equal the atmospheric pressure
outside the flask (see the earlier discussion of manometers).
However, there is another factor we must consider when we measure the pressure of the gas by this method. Water
evaporates and there is always gaseous water (water vapor) above a sample of liquid water. As a gas is collected over
water, it becomes saturated with water vapor and the total pressure of the mixture equals the partial pressure of the
gas plus the partial pressure of the water vapor. The pressure of the pure gas is therefore equal to the total pressure
minus the pressure of the water vapor—this is referred to as the “dry” gas pressure, that is, the pressure of the gas
only, without water vapor. The vapor pressure of water, which is the pressure exerted by water vapor in equilibrium
with liquid water in a closed container, depends on the temperature (Figure 9.22); more detailed information on the
temperature dependence of water vapor can be found in Table 9.2, and vapor pressure will be discussed in more
detail in the next chapter on liquids.

Pressure of a Gas Collected Over Water
If 0.200 L of argon is collected over water at a temperature of 26 °C and a pressure of 750 torr in a system
like that shown in Figure 9.21, what is the partial pressure of argon?
Solution
According to Dalton’s law, the total pressure in the bottle (750 torr) is the sum of the partial pressure of

PT = PAr + PH2 O
Rearranging this equation to solve for the pressure of argon gives:
PAr = PT − PH2 O

Chemical Stoichiometry and Gases
Chemical stoichiometry describes the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in chemical reactions.
We have previously measured quantities of reactants and products using masses for solids and volumes in conjunction
with the molarity for solutions; now we can also use gas volumes to indicate quantities. If we know the volume,
pressure, and temperature of a gas, we can use the ideal gas equation to calculate how many moles of the gas are
present. If we know how many moles of a gas are involved, we can calculate the volume of a gas at any temperature
and pressure.
Avogadro’s Law Revisited
Sometimes we can take advantage of a simplifying feature of the stoichiometry of gases that solids and solutions do
not exhibit: All gases that show ideal behavior contain the same number of molecules in the same volume (at the
same temperature and pressure). Thus, the ratios of volumes of gases involved in a chemical reaction are given by the
coefficients in the equation for the reaction, provided that the gas volumes are measured at the same temperature and
pressure.
We can extend Avogadro’s law (that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of the gas)
to chemical reactions with gases: Gases combine, or react, in definite and simple proportions by volume, provided
that all gas volumes are measured at the same temperature and pressure. For example, since nitrogen and hydrogen
gases react to produce ammonia gas according to N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⟶ 2NH3(g), a given volume of nitrogen gas
reacts with three times that volume of hydrogen gas to produce two times that volume of ammonia gas, if pressure
and temperature remain constant.
The explanation for this is illustrated in Figure 9.23. According to Avogadro’s law, equal volumes of gaseous N2,
H2, and NH3, at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules. Because one molecule of
N2 reacts with three molecules of H2 to produce two molecules of NH3, the volume of H2 required is three times the
volume of N2, and the volume of NH3 produced is two times the volume of N2.

Reaction of Gases
Propane, C3H8(g), is used in gas grills to provide the heat for cooking. What volume of O2(g) measured
at 25 °C and 760 torr is required to react with 2.7 L of propane measured under the same conditions of
temperature and pressure? Assume that the propane undergoes complete combustion.
Solution
The ratio of the volumes of C3H8 and O2 will be equal to the ratio of their coefficients in the balanced
equation for the reaction:
C3 H8(g) + 5O2(g) ⟶ 3CO2(g) + 4H2 O(l)
1 volume + 5 volumes 3 volumes + 4 volumes
From the equation, we see that one volume of C3H8 will react with five volumes of O2:
2.7 L C3 H8 × 5 L O2
1 L C3 H8
= 13.5 L O2
A volume of 13.5 L of O2 will be required to react with 2.7 L of C3H8.

N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⟶ 2NH3(g)
Solution
Because equal volumes of H2 and NH3 contain equal numbers of molecules and each three molecules of H2
that react produce two molecules of NH3, the ratio of the volumes of H2 and NH3 will be equal to 3:2. Two
volumes of NH3, in this case in units of billion ft3, will be formed from three volumes of H2:
683 billion ft3 NH3 × 3 billion ft3 H2

Greenhouse Gases and Climate Change
The thin skin of our atmosphere keeps the earth from being an ice planet and makes it habitable. In fact, this
is due to less than 0.5% of the air molecules. Of the energy from the sun that reaches the earth, almost 1
3
is reflected back into space, with the rest absorbed by the atmosphere and the surface of the earth. Some
of the energy that the earth absorbs is re-emitted as infrared (IR) radiation, a portion of which passes back
out through the atmosphere into space. Most if this IR radiation, however, is absorbed by certain atmospheric
gases, effectively trapping heat within the atmosphere in a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. This
effect maintains global temperatures within the range needed to sustain life on earth. Without our atmosphere,
the earth's average temperature would be lower by more than 30 °C (nearly 60 °F). The major greenhouse
gases (GHGs) are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and ozone. Since the Industrial Revolution, human
activity has been increasing the concentrations of GHGs, which have changed the energy balance and are
significantly altering the earth’s climate (Figure 9.24).
Figure 9.24 Greenhouse gases trap enough of the sun’s energy to make the planet habitable—this is known
as the greenhouse effect. Human activities are increasing greenhouse gas levels, warming the planet and
causing more extreme weather events.
There is strong evidence from multiple sources that higher atmospheric levels of CO2 are caused by human
activity, with fossil fuel burning accounting for about 3
4 of the recent increase in CO2. Reliable data from ice
cores reveals that CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is at the highest level in the past 800,000 years; other
evidence indicates that it may be at its highest level in 20 million years. In recent years, the CO2 concentration
has increased preindustrial levels of ~280 ppm to more than 400 ppm today (Figure 9.25).

9.4 Effusion and Diffusion of Gases
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define and explain effusion and diffusion
• State Graham’s law and use it to compute relevant gas properties
If you have ever been in a room when a piping hot pizza was delivered, you have been made aware of the fact
that gaseous molecules can quickly spread throughout a room, as evidenced by the pleasant aroma that soon reaches
your nose. Although gaseous molecules travel at tremendous speeds (hundreds of meters per second), they collide
with other gaseous molecules and travel in many different directions before reaching the desired target. At room
temperature, a gaseous molecule will experience billions of collisions per second. The mean free path is the average
distance a molecule travels between collisions. The mean free path increases with decreasing pressure; in general, the
mean free path for a gaseous molecule will be hundreds of times the diameter of the molecule
In general, we know that when a sample of gas is introduced to one part of a closed container, its molecules
very quickly disperse throughout the container; this process by which molecules disperse in space in response to
differences in concentration is called diffusion (shown in Figure 9.27). The gaseous atoms or molecules are, of
course, unaware of any concentration gradient, they simply move randomly—regions of higher concentration have
more particles than regions of lower concentrations, and so a net movement of species from high to low concentration
areas takes place. In a closed environment, diffusion will ultimately result in equal concentrations of gas throughout,
as depicted in Figure 9.27. The gaseous atoms and molecules continue to move, but since their concentrations are
the same in both bulbs, the rates of transfer between the bulbs are equal (no net transfer of molecules occurs).
Chapter 9 | Gases 493
Figure 9.27 (a) Two gases, H2 and O2, are initially separated. (b) When the stopcock is opened, they mix together.
The lighter gas, H2, passes through the opening faster than O2, so just after the stopcock is opened, more H2
molecules move to the O2 side than O2 molecules move to the H2 side. (c) After a short time, both the slower-moving
O2 molecules and the faster-moving H2 molecules have distributed themselves evenly on both sides of the vessel.
We are often interested in the rate of diffusion, the amount of gas passing through some area per unit time:
rate of diffusion = amount of gas passing through an area
unit of time
The diffusion rate depends on several factors: the concentration gradient (the increase or decrease in concentration
from one point to another); the amount of surface area available for diffusion; and the distance the gas particles must
travel. Note also that the time required for diffusion to occur is inversely proportional to the rate of diffusion, as
shown in the rate of diffusion equation.
A process involving movement of gaseous species similar to diffusion is effusion, the escape of gas molecules
through a tiny hole such as a pinhole in a balloon into a vacuum (Figure 9.28). Although diffusion and effusion rates
both depend on the molar mass of the gas involved, their rates are not equal; however, the ratios of their rates are the

Figure 9.28 Diffusion involves the unrestricted dispersal of molecules throughout space due to their random motion.
When this process is restricted to passage of molecules through very small openings in a physical barrier, the
process is called effusion.
If a mixture of gases is placed in a container with porous walls, the gases effuse through the small openings in the
walls. The lighter gases pass through the small openings more rapidly (at a higher rate) than the heavier ones (Figure
9.29). In 1832, Thomas Graham studied the rates of effusion of different gases and formulated Graham’s law of
effusion: The rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of its particles:

inversely proportional to the ratio of the square roots of the masses of their particles:

It takes 243 s for 4.46 × 10−5 mol Xe to effuse through a tiny hole. Under the same conditions, how long
will it take 4.46 × 10−5 mol Ne to effuse?
Solution
It is important to resist the temptation to use the times directly, and to remember how rate relates to time as
well as how it relates to mass. Recall the definition of rate of effusion:
Chapter 9 | Gases 495
rate of effusion = amount of gas transferred
time
and combine it with Graham’s law:
rate of effusion of gas Xe
rate of effusion of gas Ne = ℳNe
ℳXe
To get:
amount of Xe transferred
time for Xe
amount of Ne transferred
time for Ne
= ℳNe
ℳXe
Noting that amount of A = amount of B, and solving for time for Ne:
amount of Xe
time for Xe
amount of Ne
time for Ne
= time for Ne
time for Xe = ℳNe
ℳXe
= ℳNe
ℳXe
and substitute values:
time for Ne
243 s = 20.2 g mol
131.3 g mol = 0.392
Finally, solve for the desired quantity:
time for Ne = 0.392 × 243 s = 95.3 s
Note that this answer is reasonable: Since Ne is lighter than Xe, the effusion rate for Ne will be larger than
that for Xe, which means the time of effusion for Ne will be smaller than that for Xe.

Use of Diffusion for Nuclear Energy Applications: Uranium Enrichment
Gaseous diffusion has been used to produce enriched uranium for use in nuclear power plants and weapons.
Naturally occurring uranium contains only 0.72% of 235U, the kind of uranium that is “fissile,” that is, capable of
sustaining a nuclear fission chain reaction. Nuclear reactors require fuel that is 2–5% 235U, and nuclear bombs
need even higher concentrations. One way to enrich uranium to the desired levels is to take advantage of
Graham’s law. In a gaseous diffusion enrichment plant, uranium hexafluoride (UF6, the only uranium compound
that is volatile enough to work) is slowly pumped through large cylindrical vessels called diffusers, which
contain porous barriers with microscopic openings. The process is one of diffusion because the other side
of the barrier is not evacuated. The 235UF6 molecules have a higher average speed and diffuse through the
barrier a little faster than the heavier 238UF6 molecules. The gas that has passed through the barrier is slightly
enriched in 235UF6 and the residual gas is slightly depleted. The small difference in molecular weights between
235UF6 and 238UF6 only about 0.4% enrichment, is achieved in one diffuser (Figure 9.30). But by connecting
many diffusers in a sequence of stages (called a cascade), the desired level of enrichment can be attained.
Figure 9.30 In a diffuser, gaseous UF6 is pumped through a porous barrier, which partially separates 235UF6
from 238UF6 The UF6 must pass through many large diffuser units to achieve sufficient enrichment in 235U.
The large scale separation of gaseous 235UF6 from 238UF6 was first done during the World War II, at the atomic
energy installation in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, as part of the Manhattan Project (the development of the first
atomic bomb). Although the theory is simple, this required surmounting many daunting technical challenges to

make it work in practice. The barrier must have tiny, uniform holes (about 10–6 cm in diameter) and be porous
enough to produce high flow rates. All materials (the barrier, tubing, surface coatings, lubricants, and gaskets)
need to be able to contain, but not react with, the highly reactive and corrosive UF6.
Because gaseous diffusion plants require very large amounts of energy (to compress the gas to the high
pressures required and drive it through the diffuser cascade, to remove the heat produced during compression,
and so on), it is now being replaced by gas centrifuge technology, which requires far less energy. A current hot
political issue is how to deny this technology to Iran, to prevent it from producing enough enriched uranium for
them to use to make nuclear weapons.
9.5 The Kinetic-Molecular Theory
• State the postulates of the kinetic-molecular theory
• Use this theory’s postulates to explain the gas laws
The gas laws that we have seen to this point, as well as the ideal gas equation, are empirical, that is, they have been
derived from experimental observations. The mathematical forms of these laws closely describe the macroscopic
behavior of most gases at pressures less than about 1 or 2 atm. Although the gas laws describe relationships that have
been verified by many experiments, they do not tell us why gases follow these relationships.
The kinetic molecular theory (KMT) is a simple microscopic model that effectively explains the gas laws described
in previous modules of this chapter. This theory is based on the following five postulates described here. (Note: The
term “molecule” will be used to refer to the individual chemical species that compose the gas, although some gases
are composed of atomic species, for example, the noble gases.)
1. Gases are composed of molecules that are in continuous motion, travelling in straight lines and changing
direction only when they collide with other molecules or with the walls of a container.
2. The molecules composing the gas are negligibly small compared to the distances between them.
3. The pressure exerted by a gas in a container results from collisions between the gas molecules and the
container walls.
4. Gas molecules exert no attractive or repulsive forces on each other or the container walls; therefore, their
collisions are elastic (do not involve a loss of energy).
5. The average kinetic energy of the gas molecules is proportional to the kelvin temperature of the gas.
The test of the KMT and its postulates is its ability to explain and describe the behavior of a gas. The various gas
laws can be derived from the assumptions of the KMT, which have led chemists to believe that the assumptions
of the theory accurately represent the properties of gas molecules. We will first look at the individual gas laws
(Boyle’s, Charles’s, Amontons’s, Avogadro’s, and Dalton’s laws) conceptually to see how the KMT explains them.
Then, we will more carefully consider the relationships between molecular masses, speeds, and kinetic energies with
temperature, and explain Graham’s law.
The Kinetic-Molecular Theory Explains the Behavior of Gases, Part I
Recalling that gas pressure is exerted by rapidly moving gas molecules and depends directly on the number of
molecules hitting a unit area of the wall per unit of time, we see that the KMT conceptually explains the behavior of
a gas as follows:
• Amontons’s law. If the temperature is increased, the average speed and kinetic energy of the gas molecules
increase. If the volume is held constant, the increased speed of the gas molecules results in more frequent and
498 Chapter 9 | Gases
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
more forceful collisions with the walls of the container, therefore increasing the pressure (Figure 9.31).
• Charles’s law. If the temperature of a gas is increased, a constant pressure may be maintained only if the
volume occupied by the gas increases. This will result in greater average distances traveled by the molecules
to reach the container walls, as well as increased wall surface area. These conditions will decrease the both
the frequency of molecule-wall collisions and the number of collisions per unit area, the combined effects
of which balance the effect of increased collision forces due to the greater kinetic energy at the higher
temperature.
• Boyle’s law. If the gas volume is decreased, the container wall area decreases and the molecule-wall collision
frequency increases, both of which increase the pressure exerted by the gas (Figure 9.31).
• Avogadro’s law. At constant pressure and temperature, the frequency and force of molecule-wall collisions
are constant. Under such conditions, increasing the number of gaseous molecules will require a proportional
increase in the container volume in order to yield a decrease in the number of collisions per unit area to
compensate for the increased frequency of collisions (Figure 9.31).
• Dalton’s Law. Because of the large distances between them, the molecules of one gas in a mixture bombard
the container walls with the same frequency whether other gases are present or not, and the total pressure of a
gas mixture equals the sum of the (partial) pressures of the individual gases.
Figure 9.31 (a) When gas temperature increases, gas pressure increases due to increased force and frequency of
molecular collisions. (b) When volume decreases, gas pressure increases due to increased frequency of molecular
collisions. (c) When the amount of gas increases at a constant pressure, volume increases to yield a constant
number of collisions per unit wall area per unit time.
Molecular Velocities and Kinetic Energy
The previous discussion showed that the KMT qualitatively explains the behaviors described by the various gas laws.
The postulates of this theory may be applied in a more quantitative fashion to derive these individual laws. To do this,
we must first look at velocities and kinetic energies of gas molecules, and the temperature of a gas sample.
In a gas sample, individual molecules have widely varying speeds; however, because of the vast number of molecules
and collisions involved, the molecular speed distribution and average speed are constant. This molecular speed
distribution is known as a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and it depicts the relative numbers of molecules in a bulk
sample of gas that possesses a given speed (Figure 9.32).
Chapter 9 | Gases 499
Figure 9.32 The molecular speed distribution for oxygen gas at 300 K is shown here. Very few molecules move at
either very low or very high speeds. The number of molecules with intermediate speeds increases rapidly up to a
maximum, which is the most probable speed, then drops off rapidly. Note that the most probable speed, νp, is a little
less than 400 m/s, while the root mean square speed, urms, is closer to 500 m/s.
The kinetic energy (KE) of a particle of mass (m) and speed (u) is given by:
KE = 1
2 mu2
Expressing mass in kilograms and speed in meters per second will yield energy values in units of joules (J = kg m2
s–2). To deal with a large number of gas molecules, we use averages for both speed and kinetic energy. In the KMT,
the root mean square velocity of a particle, urms, is defined as the square root of the average of the squares of the
velocities with n = the number of particles:
urms = u2 = u1
2 + u2
2 + u3
2 + u4
2 + …
n
The average kinetic energy for a mole of particles, KEavg, is then equal to:
KEavg = 1
2Murms
2
where M is the molar mass expressed in units of kg/mol. The KEavg of a mole of gas molecules is also directly
proportional to the temperature of the gas and may be described by the equation:
KEavg = 3
2 RT
where R is the gas constant and T is the kelvin temperature. When used in this equation, the appropriate form of the
gas constant is 8.314 J/mol⋅K (8.314 kg m2s–2mol–1K–1). These two separate equations for KEavg may be combined
and rearranged to yield a relation between molecular speed and temperature:

Calculate the root-mean-square velocity for a mole of oxygen molecules at –23 °C.
Answer: 441 m/s
If the temperature of a gas increases, its KEavg increases, more molecules have higher speeds and fewer molecules
have lower speeds, and the distribution shifts toward higher speeds overall, that is, to the right. If temperature
decreases, KEavg decreases, more molecules have lower speeds and fewer molecules have higher speeds, and the
distribution shifts toward lower speeds overall, that is, to the left. This behavior is illustrated for nitrogen gas in
Figure 9.33.
Figure 9.33 The molecular speed distribution for nitrogen gas (N2) shifts to the right and flattens as the temperature
increases; it shifts to the left and heightens as the temperature decreases.
At a given temperature, all gases have the same KEavg for their molecules. Gases composed of lighter molecules have
more high-speed particles and a higher urms, with a speed distribution that peaks at relatively higher velocities. Gases
consisting of heavier molecules have more low-speed particles, a lower urms, and a speed distribution that peaks at
relatively lower velocities. This trend is demonstrated by the data for a series of noble gases shown in Figure 9.34.
Chapter 9 | Gases 501
Figure 9.34 Molecular velocity is directly related to molecular mass. At a given temperature, lighter molecules move
faster on average than heavier molecules.
The gas simulator (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16MolecVelocity) may be used to examine the effect
of temperature on molecular velocities. Examine the simulator’s “energy histograms” (molecular speed
distributions) and “species information” (which gives average speed values) for molecules of different
masses at various temperatures.
The Kinetic-Molecular Theory Explains the Behavior of Gases, Part II
According to Graham’s law, the molecules of a gas are in rapid motion and the molecules themselves are small. The
average distance between the molecules of a gas is large compared to the size of the molecules. As a consequence,
gas molecules can move past each other easily and diffuse at relatively fast rates.
The rate of effusion of a gas depends directly on the (average) speed of its molecules:
effusion rate ∝ urms
Using this relation, and the equation relating molecular speed to mass, Graham’s law may be easily derived as shown
here:
urms = 3RT

9.6 Non-Ideal Gas Behavior
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the physical factors that lead to deviations from ideal gas behavior
• Explain how these factors are represented in the van der Waals equation
• Define compressibility (Z) and describe how its variation with pressure reflects non-ideal behavior
• Quantify non-ideal behavior by comparing computations of gas properties using the ideal gas law and the
van der Waals equation
Thus far, the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, has been applied to a variety of different types of problems, ranging from
reaction stoichiometry and empirical and molecular formula problems to determining the density and molar mass of a
gas. As mentioned in the previous modules of this chapter, however, the behavior of a gas is often non-ideal, meaning
that the observed relationships between its pressure, volume, and temperature are not accurately described by the gas
laws. In this section, the reasons for these deviations from ideal gas behavior are considered.
One way in which the accuracy of PV = nRT can be judged is by comparing the actual volume of 1 mole of gas (its
molar volume, Vm) to the molar volume of an ideal gas at the same temperature and pressure. This ratio is called the
compressibility factor (Z) with:
Z = molar volume of gas at same T and P
molar volume of ideal gas at same T and P = ⎛
⎝PVm
RT
⎞
⎠measured
Ideal gas behavior is therefore indicated when this ratio is equal to 1, and any deviation from 1 is an indication of
non-ideal behavior. Figure 9.35 shows plots of Z over a large pressure range for several common gases.
Figure 9.35 A graph of the compressibility factor (Z) vs. pressure shows that gases can exhibit significant deviations
from the behavior predicted by the ideal gas law.
As is apparent from Figure 9.35, the ideal gas law does not describe gas behavior well at relatively high pressures.
To determine why this is, consider the differences between real gas properties and what is expected of a hypothetical
ideal gas.
Particles of a hypothetical ideal gas have no significant volume and do not attract or repel each other. In general, real
Chapter 9 | Gases 503
gases approximate this behavior at relatively low pressures and high temperatures. However, at high pressures, the
molecules of a gas are crowded closer together, and the amount of empty space between the molecules is reduced. At
these higher pressures, the volume of the gas molecules themselves becomes appreciable relative to the total volume
occupied by the gas. The gas therefore becomes less compressible at these high pressures, and although its volume
continues to decrease with increasing pressure, this decrease is not proportional as predicted by Boyle’s law.
At relatively low pressures, gas molecules have practically no attraction for one another because they are (on average)
so far apart, and they behave almost like particles of an ideal gas. At higher pressures, however, the force of attraction
is also no longer insignificant. This force pulls the molecules a little closer together, slightly decreasing the pressure
(if the volume is constant) or decreasing the volume (at constant pressure) (Figure 9.36). This change is more
pronounced at low temperatures because the molecules have lower KE relative to the attractive forces, and so they
are less effective in overcoming these attractions after colliding with one another.
Figure 9.36 (a) Attractions between gas molecules serve to decrease the gas volume at constant pressure
compared to an ideal gas whose molecules experience no attractive forces. (b) These attractive forces will decrease
the force of collisions between the molecules and container walls, therefore reducing the pressure exerted at constant
volume compared to an ideal gas.
There are several different equations that better approximate gas behavior than does the ideal gas law. The first, and
simplest, of these was developed by the Dutch scientist Johannes van der Waals in 1879. The van der Waals equation
improves upon the ideal gas law by adding two terms: one to account for the volume of the gas molecules and another
for the attractive forces between them.
The constant a corresponds to the strength of the attraction between molecules of a particular gas, and the constant
b corresponds to the size of the molecules of a particular gas. The “correction” to the pressure term in the ideal gas
law is n2 a
V 2 , and the “correction” to the volume is nb. Note that when V is relatively large and n is relatively small,
both of these correction terms become negligible, and the van der Waals equation reduces to the ideal gas law, PV =
nRT. Such a condition corresponds to a gas in which a relatively low number of molecules is occupying a relatively
large volume, that is, a gas at a relatively low pressure. Experimental values for the van der Waals constants of some
common gases are given in Table 9.3.
504 Chapter 9 | Gases
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Values of van der Waals Constants for Some Common Gases
Gas a (L2 atm/mol2) b (L/mol)

O2 1.36 0.0318

H2O 5.46 0.0305
He 0.0342 0.0237
CCl4 20.4 0.1383
Table 9.3
At low pressures, the correction for intermolecular attraction, a, is more important than the one for molecular volume,
b. At high pressures and small volumes, the correction for the volume of the molecules becomes important because
the molecules themselves are incompressible and constitute an appreciable fraction of the total volume. At some
intermediate pressure, the two corrections have opposing influences and the gas appears to follow the relationship
given by PV = nRT over a small range of pressures. This behavior is reflected by the “dips” in several of the
compressibility curves shown in Figure 9.35. The attractive force between molecules initially makes the gas more
compressible than an ideal gas, as pressure is raised (Z decreases with increasing P). At very high pressures, the gas
becomes less compressible (Z increases with P), as the gas molecules begin to occupy an increasingly significant
fraction of the total gas volume.
Strictly speaking, the ideal gas equation functions well when intermolecular attractions between gas molecules are
negligible and the gas molecules themselves do not occupy an appreciable part of the whole volume. These criteria
are satisfied under conditions of low pressure and high temperature. Under such conditions, the gas is said to behave
ideally, and deviations from the gas laws are small enough that they may be disregarded—this is, however, very often
not the case.
Example 9.24
Comparison of Ideal Gas Law and van der Waals Equation
A 4.25-L flask contains 3.46 mol CO2 at 229 °C. Calculate the pressure of this sample of CO2:
(a) from the ideal gas law
(b) from the van der Waals equation
(c) Explain the reason(s) for the difference.
Solution
(a) From the ideal gas law:
P = nRT
V = 3.46 mol × 0.08206 L atm mol−1 K−1 × 502 K
4.25 L = 33.5 atm
(b) From the van der Waals equation:
Chapter 9 | Gases 505
⎛
⎝P + n2 a
V 2
⎞
⎠ × (V − nb) = nRT ⟶ P = nRT
(V − nb) − n2 a
V 2
P = 3.46 mol × 0.08206 L atm mol−1 K−1 × 502 K

⎝4.25 L − 3.46 mol × 0.0427 L mol−1⎞
⎠
− (3.46 mol)2 × 3.59 L2 atm mol2
(4.25 L)2
This finally yields P = 32.4 atm.
(c) This is not very different from the value from the ideal gas law because the pressure is not very high
and the temperature is not very low. The value is somewhat different because CO2 molecules do have some
volume and attractions between molecules, and the ideal gas law assumes they do not have volume or
attractions.

Gases exert pressure, which is force per unit area. The pressure of a gas may be expressed in the SI unit of pascal
or kilopascal, as well as in many other units including torr, atmosphere, and bar. Atmospheric pressure is measured
using a barometer; other gas pressures can be measured using one of several types of manometers.
9.2 Relating Pressure, Volume, Amount, and Temperature: The Ideal Gas Law
The behavior of gases can be described by several laws based on experimental observations of their properties. The
pressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature, provided that the volume does
not change (Amontons’s law). The volume of a given gas sample is directly proportional to its absolute temperature at
constant pressure (Charles’s law). The volume of a given amount of gas is inversely proportional to its pressure when
temperature is held constant (Boyle’s law). Under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, equal volumes of
all gases contain the same number of molecules (Avogadro’s law).
The equations describing these laws are special cases of the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, where P is the pressure of the
gas, V is its volume, n is the number of moles of the gas, T is its kelvin temperature, and R is the ideal (universal) gas
constant.
9.3 Stoichiometry of Gaseous Substances, Mixtures, and Reactions
The ideal gas law can be used to derive a number of convenient equations relating directly measured quantities
to properties of interest for gaseous substances and mixtures. Appropriate rearrangement of the ideal gas equation
may be made to permit the calculation of gas densities and molar masses. Dalton’s law of partial pressures may be
used to relate measured gas pressures for gaseous mixtures to their compositions. Avogadro’s law may be used in
stoichiometric computations for chemical reactions involving gaseous reactants or products.
9.4 Effusion and Diffusion of Gases
Gaseous atoms and molecules move freely and randomly through space. Diffusion is the process whereby gaseous
atoms and molecules are transferred from regions of relatively high concentration to regions of relatively low
concentration. Effusion is a similar process in which gaseous species pass from a container to a vacuum through very
small orifices. The rates of effusion of gases are inversely proportional to the square roots of their densities or to the
square roots of their atoms/molecules’ masses (Graham’s law).
9.5 The Kinetic-Molecular Theory
The kinetic molecular theory is a simple but very effective model that effectively explains ideal gas behavior. The
theory assumes that gases consist of widely separated molecules of negligible volume that are in constant motion,
colliding elastically with one another and the walls of their container with average velocities determined by their
absolute temperatures. The individual molecules of a gas exhibit a range of velocities, the distribution of these
velocities being dependent on the temperature of the gas and the mass of its molecules.
9.6 Non-Ideal Gas Behavior
Gas molecules possess a finite volume and experience forces of attraction for one another. Consequently, gas behavior
is not necessarily described well by the ideal gas law. Under conditions of low pressure and high temperature, these
factors are negligible, the ideal gas equation is an accurate description of gas behavior, and the gas is said to exhibit
ideal behavior. However, at lower temperatures and higher pressures, corrections for molecular volume and molecular
attractions are required to account for finite molecular size and attractive forces. The van der Waals equation is a
modified version of the ideal gas law that can be used to account for the non-ideal behavior of gases under these
conditions.

Introduction
The great distances between atoms and molecules in a gaseous phase, and the corresponding absence of any
significant interactions between them, allows for simple descriptions of many physical properties that are the same for
all gases, regardless of their chemical identities. As described in the final module of the chapter on gases, this situation
changes at high pressures and low temperatures—conditions that permit the atoms and molecules to interact to a much
greater extent. In the liquid and solid states, these interactions are of considerable strength and play an important
role in determining a number of physical properties that do depend on the chemical identity of the substance. In this
chapter, the nature of these interactions and their effects on various physical properties of liquid and solid phases will
be examined.
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 521
10.1 Intermolecular Forces
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the types of intermolecular forces possible between atoms or molecules in condensed phases
(dispersion forces, dipole-dipole attractions, and hydrogen bonding)
• Identify the types of intermolecular forces experienced by specific molecules based on their structures
• Explain the relation between the intermolecular forces present within a substance and the temperatures
associated with changes in its physical state
As was the case for gaseous substances, the kinetic molecular theory may be used to explain the behavior of solids
and liquids. In the following description, the term particle will be used to refer to an atom, molecule, or ion. Note
that we will use the popular phrase “intermolecular attraction” to refer to attractive forces between the particles of a
substance, regardless of whether these particles are molecules, atoms, or ions.
Consider these two aspects of the molecular-level environments in solid, liquid, and gaseous matter:
• Particles in a solid are tightly packed together and often arranged in a regular pattern; in a liquid, they are
close together with no regular arrangement; in a gas, they are far apart with no regular arrangement.
• Particles in a solid vibrate about fixed positions and do not generally move in relation to one another; in a
liquid, they move past each other but remain in essentially constant contact; in a gas, they move independently
of one another except when they collide.
The differences in the properties of a solid, liquid, or gas reflect the strengths of the attractive forces between the
atoms, molecules, or ions that make up each phase. The phase in which a substance exists depends on the relative
extents of its intermolecular forces (IMFs) and the kinetic energies (KE) of its molecules. IMFs are the various
forces of attraction that may exist between the atoms and molecules of a substance due to electrostatic phenomena, as
will be detailed in this module. These forces serve to hold particles close together, whereas the particles’ KE provides
the energy required to overcome the attractive forces and thus increase the distance between particles. Figure 10.2
illustrates how changes in physical state may be induced by changing the temperature, hence, the average KE, of a
given substance.
Figure 10.2 Transitions between solid, liquid, and gaseous states of a substance occur when conditions of
temperature or pressure favor the associated changes in intermolecular forces. (Note: The space between particles in
the gas phase is much greater than shown.)

As an example of the processes depicted in this figure, consider a sample of water. When gaseous water is cooled
sufficiently, the attractions between H2O molecules will be capable of holding them together when they come into
contact with each other; the gas condenses, forming liquid H2O. For example, liquid water forms on the outside of a
cold glass as the water vapor in the air is cooled by the cold glass, as seen in Figure 10.3.
Figure 10.3 Condensation forms when water vapor in the air is cooled enough to form liquid water, such as (a) on
the outside of a cold beverage glass or (b) in the form of fog. (credit a: modification of work by Jenny Downing; credit
b: modification of work by Cory Zanker)
We can also liquefy many gases by compressing them, if the temperature is not too high. The increased pressure
brings the molecules of a gas closer together, such that the attractions between the molecules become strong relative
to their KE. Consequently, they form liquids. Butane, C4H10, is the fuel used in disposable lighters and is a gas at
standard temperature and pressure. Inside the lighter’s fuel compartment, the butane is compressed to a pressure that
results in its condensation to the liquid state, as shown in Figure 10.4.
Figure 10.4 Gaseous butane is compressed within the storage compartment of a disposable lighter, resulting in its
condensation to the liquid state. (credit: modification of work by “Sam-Cat”/Flickr)
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 523
Finally, if the temperature of a liquid becomes sufficiently low, or the pressure on the liquid becomes sufficiently
high, the molecules of the liquid no longer have enough KE to overcome the IMF between them, and a solid forms.
A more thorough discussion of these and other changes of state, or phase transitions, is provided in a later module of
this chapter.
Access this interactive simulation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16phetvisual) on states of matter,
phase transitions, and intermolecular forces. This simulation is useful for visualizing concepts introduced
throughout this chapter.
Forces between Molecules
Under appropriate conditions, the attractions between all gas molecules will cause them to form liquids or solids.
This is due to intermolecular forces, not intramolecular forces. Intramolecular forces are those within the molecule
that keep the molecule together, for example, the bonds between the atoms. Intermolecular forces are the attractions
between molecules, which determine many of the physical properties of a substance. Figure 10.5 illustrates these
different molecular forces. The strengths of these attractive forces vary widely, though usually the IMFs between
small molecules are weak compared to the intramolecular forces that bond atoms together within a molecule. For
example, to overcome the IMFs in one mole of liquid HCl and convert it into gaseous HCl requires only about 17
kilojoules. However, to break the covalent bonds between the hydrogen and chlorine atoms in one mole of HCl
requires about 25 times more energy—430 kilojoules.
Figure 10.5 Intramolecular forces keep a molecule intact. Intermolecular forces hold multiple molecules together
and determine many of a substance’s properties.
All of the attractive forces between neutral atoms and molecules are known as van der Waals forces, although they
are usually referred to more informally as intermolecular attraction. We will consider the various types of IMFs in the
next three sections of this module.
Dispersion Forces
One of the three van der Waals forces is present in all condensed phases, regardless of the nature of the atoms or
molecules composing the substance. This attractive force is called the London dispersion force in honor of German-
born American physicist Fritz London who, in 1928, first explained it. This force is often referred to as simply the
dispersion force. Because the electrons of an atom or molecule are in constant motion (or, alternatively, the electron’s
location is subject to quantum-mechanical variability), at any moment in time, an atom or molecule can develop
a temporary, instantaneous dipole if its electrons are distributed asymmetrically. The presence of this dipole can,
in turn, distort the electrons of a neighboring atom or molecule, producing an induced dipole. These two rapidly

fluctuating, temporary dipoles thus result in a relatively weak electrostatic attraction between the species—a so-called
dispersion force like that illustrated in Figure 10.6.
Figure 10.6 Dispersion forces result from the formation of temporary dipoles, as illustrated here for two nonpolar
diatomic molecules.
Dispersion forces that develop between atoms in different molecules can attract the two molecules to each other.
The forces are relatively weak, however, and become significant only when the molecules are very close. Larger and
heavier atoms and molecules exhibit stronger dispersion forces than do smaller and lighter atoms and molecules. F2
and Cl2 are gases at room temperature (reflecting weaker attractive forces); Br2 is a liquid, and I2 is a solid (reflecting
stronger attractive forces). Trends in observed melting and boiling points for the halogens clearly demonstrate this
effect, as seen in Table 10.1.
Melting and Boiling Points of the Halogens
Halogen Molar Mass Atomic Radius Melting Point Boiling Point
fluorine, F2 38 g/mol 72 pm 53 K 85 K
chlorine, Cl2 71 g/mol 99 pm 172 K 238 K
bromine, Br2 160 g/mol 114 pm 266 K 332 K
iodine, I2 254 g/mol 133 pm 387 K 457 K
astatine, At2 420 g/mol 150 pm 575 K 610 K
Table 10.1
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 525
The increase in melting and boiling points with increasing atomic/molecular size may be rationalized by considering
how the strength of dispersion forces is affected by the electronic structure of the atoms or molecules in the substance.
In a larger atom, the valence electrons are, on average, farther from the nuclei than in a smaller atom. Thus, they are
less tightly held and can more easily form the temporary dipoles that produce the attraction. The measure of how easy
or difficult it is for another electrostatic charge (for example, a nearby ion or polar molecule) to distort a molecule’s
charge distribution (its electron cloud) is known as polarizability. A molecule that has a charge cloud that is easily
distorted is said to be very polarizable and will have large dispersion forces; one with a charge cloud that is difficult
to distort is not very polarizable and will have small dispersion forces.
Example 10.1
London Forces and Their Effects
Order the following compounds of a group 14 element and hydrogen from lowest to highest boiling point:
CH4, SiH4, GeH4, and SnH4. Explain your reasoning.
Solution
Applying the skills acquired in the chapter on chemical bonding and molecular geometry, all of these
compounds are predicted to be nonpolar, so they may experience only dispersion forces: the smaller the
molecule, the less polarizable and the weaker the dispersion forces; the larger the molecule, the larger the
dispersion forces. The molar masses of CH4, SiH4, GeH4, and SnH4 are approximately 16 g/mol, 32 g/mol,
77 g/mol, and 123 g/mol, respectively. Therefore, CH4 is expected to have the lowest boiling point and SnH4
the highest boiling point. The ordering from lowest to highest boiling point is expected to be CH4 < SiH4 <
GeH4 < SnH4.
A graph of the actual boiling points of these compounds versus the period of the group 14 element shows
this prediction to be correct:

Order the following hydrocarbons from lowest to highest boiling point: C2H6, C3H8, and C4H10.
Answer: C2H6 < C3H8 < C4H10. All of these compounds are nonpolar and only have London dispersion
forces: the larger the molecule, the larger the dispersion forces and the higher the boiling point. The ordering
from lowest to highest boiling point is therefore C2H6 < C3H8 < C4H10.
The shapes of molecules also affect the magnitudes of the dispersion forces between them. For example, boiling
526 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
points for the isomers n-pentane, isopentane, and neopentane (shown in Figure 10.7) are 36 °C, 27 °C, and 9.5
°C, respectively. Even though these compounds are composed of molecules with the same chemical formula, C5H12,
the difference in boiling points suggests that dispersion forces in the liquid phase are different, being greatest for
n-pentane and least for neopentane. The elongated shape of n-pentane provides a greater surface area available for
contact between molecules, resulting in correspondingly stronger dispersion forces. The more compact shape of
isopentane offers a smaller surface area available for intermolecular contact and, therefore, weaker dispersion forces.
Neopentane molecules are the most compact of the three, offering the least available surface area for intermolecular
contact and, hence, the weakest dispersion forces. This behavior is analogous to the connections that may be formed
between strips of VELCRO brand fasteners: the greater the area of the strip’s contact, the stronger the connection.
Figure 10.7 The strength of the dispersion forces increases with the contact area between molecules, as
demonstrated by the boiling points of these pentane isomers.
Geckos and Intermolecular Forces
Geckos have an amazing ability to adhere to most surfaces. They can quickly run up smooth walls and across
ceilings that have no toe-holds, and they do this without having suction cups or a sticky substance on their
toes. And while a gecko can lift its feet easily as it walks along a surface, if you attempt to pick it up, it sticks
to the surface. How are geckos (as well as spiders and some other insects) able to do this? Although this
phenomenon has been investigated for hundreds of years, scientists only recently uncovered the details of the
process that allows geckos’ feet to behave this way.
Geckos’ toes are covered with hundreds of thousands of tiny hairs known as setae, with each seta, in turn,
branching into hundreds of tiny, flat, triangular tips called spatulae. The huge numbers of spatulae on its setae
provide a gecko, shown in Figure 10.8, with a large total surface area for sticking to a surface. In 2000, Kellar
Autumn, who leads a multi-institutional gecko research team, found that geckos adhered equally well to both
polar silicon dioxide and nonpolar gallium arsenide. This proved that geckos stick to surfaces because of
dispersion forces—weak intermolecular attractions arising from temporary, synchronized charge distributions
between adjacent molecules. Although dispersion forces are very weak, the total attraction over millions of
Chemistry in Everyday Life
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 527
spatulae is large enough to support many times the gecko’s weight.
In 2014, two scientists developed a model to explain how geckos can rapidly transition from “sticky” to “non-
sticky.” Alex Greaney and Congcong Hu at Oregon State University described how geckos can achieve this
by changing the angle between their spatulae and the surface. Geckos’ feet, which are normally nonsticky,
become sticky when a small shear force is applied. By curling and uncurling their toes, geckos can alternate
between sticking and unsticking from a surface, and thus easily move across it. Further investigations may
eventually lead to the development of better adhesives and other applications.
Figure 10.8 Geckos’ toes contain large numbers of tiny hairs (setae), which branch into many triangular tips
(spatulae). Geckos adhere to surfaces because of van der Waals attractions between the surface and a
gecko’s millions of spatulae. By changing how the spatulae contact the surface, geckos can turn their
stickiness “on” and “off.” (credit photo: modification of work by “JC*+A!”/Flickr)

research that determined that van der Waals forces are responsible for a gecko’s ability to cling and
climb.
Dipole-Dipole Attractions
Recall from the chapter on chemical bonding and molecular geometry that polar molecules have a partial positive
charge on one side and a partial negative charge on the other side of the molecule—a separation of charge called a
dipole. Consider a polar molecule such as hydrogen chloride, HCl. In the HCl molecule, the more electronegative Cl
atom bears the partial negative charge, whereas the less electronegative H atom bears the partial positive charge. An
attractive force between HCl molecules results from the attraction between the positive end of one HCl molecule and
the negative end of another. This attractive force is called a dipole-dipole attraction—the electrostatic force between
the partially positive end of one polar molecule and the partially negative end of another, as illustrated in Figure
10.9.
Link to Learning
528 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids

Figure 10.9 This image shows two arrangements of polar molecules, such as HCl, that allow an attraction between
the partial negative end of one molecule and the partial positive end of another.
The effect of a dipole-dipole attraction is apparent when we compare the properties of HCl molecules to nonpolar F2
molecules. Both HCl and F2 consist of the same number of atoms and have approximately the same molecular mass.
At a temperature of 150 K, molecules of both substances would have the same average KE. However, the dipole-
dipole attractions between HCl molecules are sufficient to cause them to “stick together” to form a liquid, whereas
the relatively weaker dispersion forces between nonpolar F2 molecules are not, and so this substance is gaseous
at this temperature. The higher normal boiling point of HCl (188 K) compared to F2 (85 K) is a reflection of the
greater strength of dipole-dipole attractions between HCl molecules, compared to the attractions between nonpolar
F2 molecules. We will often use values such as boiling or freezing points, or enthalpies of vaporization or fusion, as
indicators of the relative strengths of IMFs of attraction present within different substances.
Example 10.2
Dipole-Dipole Forces and Their Effects
Predict which will have the higher boiling point: N2 or CO. Explain your reasoning.
Solution
CO and N2 are both diatomic molecules with masses of about 28 amu, so they experience similar London
dispersion forces. Because CO is a polar molecule, it experiences dipole-dipole attractions. Because N2 is
nonpolar, its molecules cannot exhibit dipole-dipole attractions. The dipole-dipole attractions between CO
molecules are comparably stronger than the dispersion forces between nonpolar N2 molecules, so CO is
expected to have the higher boiling point.
Check Your Learning
Predict which will have the higher boiling point: ICl or Br2. Explain your reasoning.
Answer: ICl. ICl and Br2 have similar masses (~160 amu) and therefore experience similar London
dispersion forces. ICl is polar and thus also exhibits dipole-dipole attractions; Br2 is nonpolar and does not.
The relatively stronger dipole-dipole attractions require more energy to overcome, so ICl will have the higher
boiling point.
Hydrogen Bonding
Nitrosyl fluoride (ONF, molecular mass 49 amu) is a gas at room temperature. Water (H2O, molecular mass 18
amu) is a liquid, even though it has a lower molecular mass. We clearly cannot attribute this difference between
the two compounds to dispersion forces. Both molecules have about the same shape and ONF is the heavier and
larger molecule. It is, therefore, expected to experience more significant dispersion forces. Additionally, we cannot
attribute this difference in boiling points to differences in the dipole moments of the molecules. Both molecules are
polar and exhibit comparable dipole moments. The large difference between the boiling points is due to a particularly
strong dipole-dipole attraction that may occur when a molecule contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a fluorine,
oxygen, or nitrogen atom (the three most electronegative elements). The very large difference in electronegativity
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 529
between the H atom (2.1) and the atom to which it is bonded (4.0 for an F atom, 3.5 for an O atom, or 3.0 for
a N atom), combined with the very small size of a H atom and the relatively small sizes of F, O, or N atoms,
leads to highly concentrated partial charges with these atoms. Molecules with F-H, O-H, or N-H moieties are very
strongly attracted to similar moieties in nearby molecules, a particularly strong type of dipole-dipole attraction called
hydrogen bonding. Examples of hydrogen bonds include HF⋯HF, H2O⋯HOH, and H3N⋯HNH2, in which the
hydrogen bonds are denoted by dots. Figure 10.10 illustrates hydrogen bonding between water molecules.
Figure 10.10 Water molecules participate in multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions with nearby water molecules.
Despite use of the word “bond,” keep in mind that hydrogen bonds are intermolecular attractive forces, not
intramolecular attractive forces (covalent bonds). Hydrogen bonds are much weaker than covalent bonds, only about
5 to 10% as strong, but are generally much stronger than other dipole-dipole attractions and dispersion forces.
Hydrogen bonds have a pronounced effect on the properties of condensed phases (liquids and solids). For example,
consider the trends in boiling points for the binary hydrides of group 15 (NH3, PH3, AsH3, and SbH3), group 16
hydrides (H2O, H2S, H2Se, and H2Te), and group 17 hydrides (HF, HCl, HBr, and HI). The boiling points of the
heaviest three hydrides for each group are plotted in Figure 10.11. As we progress down any of these groups, the
polarities of the molecules decrease slightly, whereas the sizes of the molecules increase substantially. The effect
of increasingly stronger dispersion forces dominates that of increasingly weaker dipole-dipole attractions, and the
boiling points are observed to increase steadily.

Figure 10.11 For the group 15, 16, and 17 hydrides, the boiling points for each class of compounds increase with
increasing molecular mass for elements in periods 3, 4, and 5.
If we use this trend to predict the boiling points for the lightest hydride for each group, we would expect NH3 to boil
at about −120 °C, H2O to boil at about −80 °C, and HF to boil at about −110 °C. However, when we measure the
boiling points for these compounds, we find that they are dramatically higher than the trends would predict, as shown
in Figure 10.12. The stark contrast between our naïve predictions and reality provides compelling evidence for the
strength of hydrogen bonding.
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 531
Figure 10.12 In comparison to periods 3−5, the binary hydrides of period 2 elements in groups 17, 16 and 15 (F, O
and N, respectively) exhibit anomalously high boiling points due to hydrogen bonding.
Example 10.3
Effect of Hydrogen Bonding on Boiling Points
Consider the compounds dimethylether (CH3OCH3), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and propane (CH3CH2CH3).
Their boiling points, not necessarily in order, are −42.1 °C, −24.8 °C, and 78.4 °C. Match each compound
with its boiling point. Explain your reasoning.
Solution
The VSEPR-predicted shapes of CH3OCH3, CH3CH2OH, and CH3CH2CH3 are similar, as are their molar
masses (46 g/mol, 46 g/mol, and 44 g/mol, respectively), so they will exhibit similar dispersion forces. Since
CH3CH2CH3 is nonpolar, it may exhibit only dispersion forces. Because CH3OCH3 is polar, it will also
experience dipole-dipole attractions. Finally, CH3CH2OH has an −OH group, and so it will experience the
uniquely strong dipole-dipole attraction known as hydrogen bonding. So the ordering in terms of strength
of IMFs, and thus boiling points, is CH3CH2CH3 < CH3OCH3 < CH3CH2OH. The boiling point of propane
is −42.1 °C, the boiling point of dimethylether is −24.8 °C, and the boiling point of ethanol is 78.5 °C.

Answer: The melting point and boiling point for methylamine are predicted to be significantly greater than
those of ethane. CH3CH3 and CH3NH2 are similar in size and mass, but methylamine possesses an −NH
group and therefore may exhibit hydrogen bonding. This greatly increases its IMFs, and therefore its melting
and boiling points. It is difficult to predict values, but the known values are a melting point of −93 °C and a

Hydrogen Bonding and DNA
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is found in every living organism and contains the genetic information that
determines the organism’s characteristics, provides the blueprint for making the proteins necessary for life, and
serves as a template to pass this information on to the organism’s offspring. A DNA molecule consists of two
(anti-)parallel chains of repeating nucleotides, which form its well-known double helical structure, as shown in
Figure 10.13.
Figure 10.13 Two separate DNA molecules form a double-stranded helix in which the molecules are held
together via hydrogen bonding. (credit: modification of work by Jerome Walker, Dennis Myts)
Each nucleotide contains a (deoxyribose) sugar bound to a phosphate group on one side, and one of four
nitrogenous bases on the other. Two of the bases, cytosine (C) and thymine (T), are single-ringed structures
known as pyrimidines. The other two, adenine (A) and guanine (G), are double-ringed structures called
purines. These bases form complementary base pairs consisting of one purine and one pyrimidine, with
adenine pairing with thymine, and cytosine with guanine. Each base pair is held together by hydrogen bonding.
A and T share two hydrogen bonds, C and G share three, and both pairings have a similar shape and structure
Figure 10.14.
How Sciences Interconnect
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 533
Figure 10.14 The geometries of the base molecules result in maximum hydrogen bonding between adenine
and thymine (AT) and between guanine and cytosine (GC), so-called “complementary base pairs.”
The cumulative effect of millions of hydrogen bonds effectively holds the two strands of DNA together.
Importantly, the two strands of DNA can relatively easily “unzip” down the middle since hydrogen bonds are
relatively weak compared to the covalent bonds that hold the atoms of the individual DNA molecules together.
This allows both strands to function as a template for replication.
10.2 Properties of Liquids
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Distinguish between adhesive and cohesive forces
• Define viscosity, surface tension, and capillary rise
• Describe the roles of intermolecular attractive forces in each of these properties/phenomena
When you pour a glass of water, or fill a car with gasoline, you observe that water and gasoline flow freely. But when
you pour syrup on pancakes or add oil to a car engine, you note that syrup and motor oil do not flow as readily. The
viscosity of a liquid is a measure of its resistance to flow. Water, gasoline, and other liquids that flow freely have a
low viscosity. Honey, syrup, motor oil, and other liquids that do not flow freely, like those shown in Figure 10.15,
have higher viscosities. We can measure viscosity by measuring the rate at which a metal ball falls through a liquid
(the ball falls more slowly through a more viscous liquid) or by measuring the rate at which a liquid flows through a
narrow tube (more viscous liquids flow more slowly).

The IMFs between the molecules of a liquid, the size and shape of the molecules, and the temperature determine
how easily a liquid flows. As Table 10.2 shows, the more structurally complex are the molecules in a liquid and
the stronger the IMFs between them, the more difficult it is for them to move past each other and the greater is the
viscosity of the liquid. As the temperature increases, the molecules move more rapidly and their kinetic energies are
better able to overcome the forces that hold them together; thus, the viscosity of the liquid decreases.

honey variable ~2,000–10,000

Table 10.2
The various IMFs between identical molecules of a substance are examples of cohesive forces. The molecules within
a liquid are surrounded by other molecules and are attracted equally in all directions by the cohesive forces within
the liquid. However, the molecules on the surface of a liquid are attracted only by about one-half as many molecules.
Because of the unbalanced molecular attractions on the surface molecules, liquids contract to form a shape that
minimizes the number of molecules on the surface—that is, the shape with the minimum surface area. A small drop
of liquid tends to assume a spherical shape, as shown in Figure 10.16, because in a sphere, the ratio of surface area
to volume is at a minimum. Larger drops are more greatly affected by gravity, air resistance, surface interactions, and
so on, and as a result, are less spherical.

sphere together; adhesive forces keep the drop attached to the web. (credit photo: modification of work by

Surface tension is defined as the energy required to increase the surface area of a liquid, or the force required to
increase the length of a liquid surface by a given amount. This property results from the cohesive forces between
molecules at the surface of a liquid, and it causes the surface of a liquid to behave like a stretched rubber membrane.
Surface tensions of several liquids are presented in Table 10.3. Among common liquids, water exhibits a distinctly
high surface tension due to strong hydrogen bonding between its molecules. As a result of this high surface tension,
the surface of water represents a relatively “tough skin” that can withstand considerable force without breaking. A
steel needle carefully placed on water will float. Some insects, like the one shown in Figure 10.17, even though they
are denser than water, move on its surface because they are supported by the surface tension.

The IMFs of attraction between two different molecules are called adhesive forces. Consider what happens when
water comes into contact with some surface. If the adhesive forces between water molecules and the molecules of the
surface are weak compared to the cohesive forces between the water molecules, the water does not “wet” the surface.
For example, water does not wet waxed surfaces or many plastics such as polyethylene. Water forms drops on these
surfaces because the cohesive forces within the drops are greater than the adhesive forces between the water and the
plastic. Water spreads out on glass because the adhesive force between water and glass is greater than the cohesive
forces within the water. When water is confined in a glass tube, its meniscus (surface) has a concave shape because
the water wets the glass and creeps up the side of the tube. On the other hand, the cohesive forces between mercury
atoms are much greater than the adhesive forces between mercury and glass. Mercury therefore does not wet glass,
and it forms a convex meniscus when confined in a tube because the cohesive forces within the mercury tend to draw
it into a drop (Figure 10.18).

shapes for mercury (left) and water (right) in glass tubes. (credit: Mark Ott)
If you place one end of a paper towel in spilled wine, as shown in Figure 10.19, the liquid wicks up the paper towel.
A similar process occurs in a cloth towel when you use it to dry off after a shower. These are examples of capillary
action—when a liquid flows within a porous material due to the attraction of the liquid molecules to the surface of
the material and to other liquid molecules. The adhesive forces between the liquid and the porous material, combined
with the cohesive forces within the liquid, may be strong enough to move the liquid upward against gravity.
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 537
Figure 10.19 Wine wicks up a paper towel (left) because of the strong attractions of water (and ethanol) molecules
to the −OH groups on the towel’s cellulose fibers and the strong attractions of water molecules to other water (and
ethanol) molecules (right). (credit photo: modification of work by Mark Blaser)
Towels soak up liquids like water because the fibers of a towel are made of molecules that are attracted to water
molecules. Most cloth towels are made of cotton, and paper towels are generally made from paper pulp. Both consist
of long molecules of cellulose that contain many −OH groups. Water molecules are attracted to these −OH groups and
form hydrogen bonds with them, which draws the H2O molecules up the cellulose molecules. The water molecules
are also attracted to each other, so large amounts of water are drawn up the cellulose fibers.
Capillary action can also occur when one end of a small diameter tube is immersed in a liquid, as illustrated in Figure
10.20. If the liquid molecules are strongly attracted to the tube molecules, the liquid creeps up the inside of the tube
until the weight of the liquid and the adhesive forces are in balance. The smaller the diameter of the tube is, the
higher the liquid climbs. It is partly by capillary action occurring in plant cells called xylem that water and dissolved
nutrients are brought from the soil up through the roots and into a plant. Capillary action is the basis for thin layer
chromatography, a laboratory technique commonly used to separate small quantities of mixtures. You depend on a
constant supply of tears to keep your eyes lubricated and on capillary action to pump tear fluid away.

Figure 10.20 Depending upon the relative strengths of adhesive and cohesive forces, a liquid may rise (such as
water) or fall (such as mercury) in a glass capillary tube. The extent of the rise (or fall) is directly proportional to the
surface tension of the liquid and inversely proportional to the density of the liquid and the radius of the tube.
The height to which a liquid will rise in a capillary tube is determined by several factors as shown in the following
equation:
h = 2T cos θ
rρg
In this equation, h is the height of the liquid inside the capillary tube relative to the surface of the liquid outside the
tube, T is the surface tension of the liquid, θ is the contact angle between the liquid and the tube, r is the radius of
the tube, ρ is the density of the liquid, and g is the acceleration due to gravity, 9.8 m/s2. When the tube is made of a
material to which the liquid molecules are strongly attracted, they will spread out completely on the surface, which
corresponds to a contact angle of 0°. This is the situation for water rising in a glass tube.
Example 10.4
Capillary Rise
At 25 °C, how high will water rise in a glass capillary tube with an inner diameter of 0.25 mm?
For water, T = 71.99 mN/m and ρ = 1.0 g/cm3.
Solution
The liquid will rise to a height h given by: h = 2T cos θ
rρg
The Newton is defined as a kg m/s2, and so the provided surface tension is equivalent to 0.07199 kg/s2. The
provided density must be converted into units that will cancel appropriately: ρ = 1000 kg/m3. The diameter
of the tube in meters is 0.00025 m, so the radius is 0.000125 m. For a glass tube immersed in water, the
contact angle is θ = 0°, so cos θ = 1. Finally, acceleration due to gravity on the earth is g = 9.8 m/s2.
Substituting these values into the equation, and cancelling units, we have:

Biomedical Applications of Capillary Action
Many medical tests require drawing a small amount of blood, for example to determine the amount of glucose
in someone with diabetes or the hematocrit level in an athlete. This procedure can be easily done because
of capillary action, the ability of a liquid to flow up a small tube against gravity, as shown in Figure 10.21.
When your finger is pricked, a drop of blood forms and holds together due to surface tension—the unbalanced
intermolecular attractions at the surface of the drop. Then, when the open end of a narrow-diameter glass tube
touches the drop of blood, the adhesive forces between the molecules in the blood and those at the glass
surface draw the blood up the tube. How far the blood goes up the tube depends on the diameter of the tube
(and the type of fluid). A small tube has a relatively large surface area for a given volume of blood, which
results in larger (relative) attractive forces, allowing the blood to be drawn farther up the tube. The liquid itself
is held together by its own cohesive forces. When the weight of the liquid in the tube generates a downward
force equal to the upward force associated with capillary action, the liquid stops rising.

diameter glass tube. (credit: modification of work by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
10.3 Phase Transitions
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define phase transitions and phase transition temperatures
• Explain the relation between phase transition temperatures and intermolecular attractive forces
• Describe the processes represented by typical heating and cooling curves, and compute heat flows and
enthalpy changes accompanying these processes
We witness and utilize changes of physical state, or phase transitions, in a great number of ways. As one example
of global significance, consider the evaporation, condensation, freezing, and melting of water. These changes of state
are essential aspects of our earth’s water cycle as well as many other natural phenomena and technological processes
of central importance to our lives. In this module, the essential aspects of phase transitions are explored.
Vaporization and Condensation
When a liquid vaporizes in a closed container, gas molecules cannot escape. As these gas phase molecules move
randomly about, they will occasionally collide with the surface of the condensed phase, and in some cases, these
collisions will result in the molecules re-entering the condensed phase. The change from the gas phase to the liquid is
called condensation. When the rate of condensation becomes equal to the rate of vaporization, neither the amount
of the liquid nor the amount of the vapor in the container changes. The vapor in the container is then said to be in
equilibrium with the liquid. Keep in mind that this is not a static situation, as molecules are continually exchanged
between the condensed and gaseous phases. Such is an example of a dynamic equilibrium, the status of a system in
Chemistry in Everyday Life
540 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
which reciprocal processes (for example, vaporization and condensation) occur at equal rates. The pressure exerted
by the vapor in equilibrium with a liquid in a closed container at a given temperature is called the liquid’s vapor
pressure (or equilibrium vapor pressure). The area of the surface of the liquid in contact with a vapor and the size
of the vessel have no effect on the vapor pressure, although they do affect the time required for the equilibrium to be
reached. We can measure the vapor pressure of a liquid by placing a sample in a closed container, like that illustrated
in Figure 10.22, and using a manometer to measure the increase in pressure that is due to the vapor in equilibrium
with the condensed phase.
Figure 10.22 In a closed container, dynamic equilibrium is reached when (a) the rate of molecules escaping from
the liquid to become the gas (b) increases and eventually (c) equals the rate of gas molecules entering the liquid.
When this equilibrium is reached, the vapor pressure of the gas is constant, although the vaporization and
condensation processes continue.
The chemical identities of the molecules in a liquid determine the types (and strengths) of intermolecular attractions
possible; consequently, different substances will exhibit different equilibrium vapor pressures. Relatively strong
intermolecular attractive forces will serve to impede vaporization as well as favoring “recapture” of gas-phase
molecules when they collide with the liquid surface, resulting in a relatively low vapor pressure. Weak intermolecular
attractions present less of a barrier to vaporization, and a reduced likelihood of gas recapture, yielding relatively high
vapor pressures. The following example illustrates this dependence of vapor pressure on intermolecular attractive
forces.
Example 10.5
Explaining Vapor Pressure in Terms of IMFs
Given the shown structural formulas for these four compounds, explain their relative vapor pressures in
terms of types and extents of IMFs:
Solution
Diethyl ether has a very small dipole and most of its intermolecular attractions are London forces. Although
this molecule is the largest of the four under consideration, its IMFs are the weakest and, as a result, its
molecules most readily escape from the liquid. It also has the highest vapor pressure. Due to its smaller
size, ethanol exhibits weaker dispersion forces than diethyl ether. However, ethanol is capable of hydrogen
bonding and, therefore, exhibits stronger overall IMFs, which means that fewer molecules escape from the
liquid at any given temperature, and so ethanol has a lower vapor pressure than diethyl ether. Water is
much smaller than either of the previous substances and exhibits weaker dispersion forces, but its extensive
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 541
hydrogen bonding provides stronger intermolecular attractions, fewer molecules escaping the liquid, and
a lower vapor pressure than for either diethyl ether or ethanol. Ethylene glycol has two −OH groups, so,
like water, it exhibits extensive hydrogen bonding. It is much larger than water and thus experiences larger
London forces. Its overall IMFs are the largest of these four substances, which means its vaporization rate
will be the slowest and, consequently, its vapor pressure the lowest.

At 20 °C, the vapor pressures of several alcohols are given in this table. Explain these vapor pressures in
terms of types and extents of IMFs for these alcohols:
Compound methanol

propanol
C3H7OH
butanol
C4H9OH
Vapor Pressure at 20
°C 11.9 kPa 5.95 kPa 2.67 kPa 0.56 kPa
Answer: All these compounds exhibit hydrogen bonding; these strong IMFs are difficult for the molecules
to overcome, so the vapor pressures are relatively low. As the size of molecule increases from methanol to
butanol, dispersion forces increase, which means that the vapor pressures decrease as observed:
Pmethanol > Pethanol > Ppropanol > Pbutanol.
As temperature increases, the vapor pressure of a liquid also increases due to the increased average KE of its
molecules. Recall that at any given temperature, the molecules of a substance experience a range of kinetic energies,
with a certain fraction of molecules having a sufficient energy to overcome IMF and escape the liquid (vaporize).
At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in
Figure 10.23. The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that
escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.
Figure 10.23 Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid. At the higher
temperature, more molecules have the necessary kinetic energy, KE, to escape from the liquid into the gas phase.
Boiling Points
When the vapor pressure increases enough to equal the external atmospheric pressure, the liquid reaches its boiling
point. The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its equilibrium vapor pressure is equal to the pressure
exerted on the liquid by its gaseous surroundings. For liquids in open containers, this pressure is that due to the earth’s
atmosphere. The normal boiling point of a liquid is defined as its boiling point when surrounding pressure is equal
to 1 atm (101.3 kPa). Figure 10.24 shows the variation in vapor pressure with temperature for several different

substances. Considering the definition of boiling point, these curves may be seen as depicting the dependence of a
liquid’s boiling point on surrounding pressure.
Figure 10.24 The boiling points of liquids are the temperatures at which their equilibrium vapor pressures equal the
pressure of the surrounding atmosphere. Normal boiling points are those corresponding to a pressure of 1 atm (101.3
kPa.)

Solution
The graph of the vapor pressure of water versus temperature in Figure 10.24 indicates that the vapor
pressure of water is 68 kPa at about 90 °C. Thus, at about 90 °C, the vapor pressure of water will equal the
atmospheric pressure in Leadville, and water will boil.

Answer: Approximately 40 kPa (0.4 atm)
The quantitative relation between a substance’s vapor pressure and its temperature is described by the Clausius-
Clapeyron equation:
P = Ae−ΔHvap /RT
where ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization for the liquid, R is the gas constant, and A is a constant whose value
depends on the chemical identity of the substance. Temperature T must be in Kelvin in this equation. This equation is
often rearranged into logarithmic form to yield the linear equation:
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 543
ln P = − ΔHvap
RT + ln A
This linear equation may be expressed in a two-point format that is convenient for use in various computations, as
demonstrated in the example exercises that follow. If at temperature T1, the vapor pressure is P1, and at temperature
T2, the vapor pressure is P2, the corresponding linear equations are:
ln P1 = − ΔHvap
RT1
+ ln A and ln P2 = − ΔHvap
RT2

Since the constant, A, is the same, these two equations may be rearranged to isolate ln A and then set them equal to
one another:

its vapor pressure is 100.0 kPa. Use this information to estimate the enthalpy of vaporization for isooctane.

If the temperature and vapor pressure are known at one point, along with the enthalpy of vaporization,

Enthalpy of Vaporization
Vaporization is an endothermic process. The cooling effect can be evident when you leave a swimming pool or a
shower. When the water on your skin evaporates, it removes heat from your skin and causes you to feel cold. The
energy change associated with the vaporization process is the enthalpy of vaporization, ΔHvap. For example, the
vaporization of water at standard temperature is represented by:
H2 O(l) ⟶ H2 O(g) ΔHvap = 44.01 kJ/mol
As described in the chapter on thermochemistry, the reverse of an endothermic process is exothermic. And so, the
condensation of a gas releases heat:
H2 O(g) ⟶ H2 O(l) ΔHcon = −ΔHvap = −44.01 kJ/mol
Example 10.9
Using Enthalpy of Vaporization
One way our body is cooled is by evaporation of the water in sweat (Figure 10.25). In very hot climates,
we can lose as much as 1.5 L of sweat per day. Although sweat is not pure water, we can get an approximate
value of the amount of heat removed by evaporation by assuming that it is. How much heat is required to
evaporate 1.5 L of water (1.5 kg) at T = 37 °C (normal body temperature); ΔHvap = 43.46 kJ/mol at 37 °C.

Melting and Freezing
When we heat a crystalline solid, we increase the average energy of its atoms, molecules, or ions and the solid gets
hotter. At some point, the added energy becomes large enough to partially overcome the forces holding the molecules
or ions of the solid in their fixed positions, and the solid begins the process of transitioning to the liquid state, or
melting. At this point, the temperature of the solid stops rising, despite the continual input of heat, and it remains
constant until all of the solid is melted. Only after all of the solid has melted will continued heating increase the
temperature of the liquid (Figure 10.26).

Figure 10.26 (a) This beaker of ice has a temperature of −12.0 °C. (b) After 10 minutes the ice has absorbed

more heat, but its temperature is still 0 °C. The ice melts without changing its temperature. (d) Only after all the ice
has melted does the heat absorbed cause the temperature to increase to 22.2 °C. (credit: modification of work by
Mark Ott)
If we stop heating during melting and place the mixture of solid and liquid in a perfectly insulated container so no heat
can enter or escape, the solid and liquid phases remain in equilibrium. This is almost the situation with a mixture of
ice and water in a very good thermos bottle; almost no heat gets in or out, and the mixture of solid ice and liquid water
remains for hours. In a mixture of solid and liquid at equilibrium, the reciprocal processes of melting and freezing
occur at equal rates, and the quantities of solid and liquid therefore remain constant. The temperature at which the
solid and liquid phases of a given substance are in equilibrium is called the melting point of the solid or the freezing
point of the liquid. Use of one term or the other is normally dictated by the direction of the phase transition being
considered, for example, solid to liquid (melting) or liquid to solid (freezing).
The enthalpy of fusion and the melting point of a crystalline solid depend on the strength of the attractive forces
between the units present in the crystal. Molecules with weak attractive forces form crystals with low melting points.
Crystals consisting of particles with stronger attractive forces melt at higher temperatures.
The amount of heat required to change one mole of a substance from the solid state to the liquid state is the enthalpy of
fusion, ΔHfus of the substance. The enthalpy of fusion of ice is 6.0 kJ/mol at 0 °C. Fusion (melting) is an endothermic
process:
H2 O(s) ⟶ H2 O(l) ΔHfus = 6.01 kJ/mol
The reciprocal process, freezing, is an exothermic process whose enthalpy change is −6.0 kJ/mol at 0 °C:
H2 O(l) ⟶ H2 O(s) ΔHfrz = −ΔHfus = −6.01 kJ/mol
Sublimation and Deposition
Some solids can transition directly into the gaseous state, bypassing the liquid state, via a process known as
sublimation. At room temperature and standard pressure, a piece of dry ice (solid CO2) sublimes, appearing to
gradually disappear without ever forming any liquid. Snow and ice sublime at temperatures below the melting point of
water, a slow process that may be accelerated by winds and the reduced atmospheric pressures at high altitudes. When
solid iodine is warmed, the solid sublimes and a vivid purple vapor forms (Figure 10.27). The reverse of sublimation
is called deposition, a process in which gaseous substances condense directly into the solid state, bypassing the liquid
state. The formation of frost is an example of deposition.
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 547
Figure 10.27 Sublimation of solid iodine in the bottom of the tube produces a purple gas that subsequently deposits
as solid iodine on the colder part of the tube above. (credit: modification of work by Mark Ott)
Like vaporization, the process of sublimation requires an input of energy to overcome intermolecular attractions. The
enthalpy of sublimation, ΔHsub, is the energy required to convert one mole of a substance from the solid to the gaseous
state. For example, the sublimation of carbon dioxide is represented by:
CO2(s) ⟶ CO2(g) ΔHsub = 26.1 kJ/mol
Likewise, the enthalpy change for the reverse process of deposition is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that
for sublimation:
CO2(g) ⟶ CO2(s) ΔHdep = −ΔHsub = −26.1 kJ/mol
Consider the extent to which intermolecular attractions must be overcome to achieve a given phase transition.
Converting a solid into a liquid requires that these attractions be only partially overcome; transition to the gaseous
state requires that they be completely overcome. As a result, the enthalpy of fusion for a substance is less than its
enthalpy of vaporization. This same logic can be used to derive an approximate relation between the enthalpies of all
phase changes for a given substance. Though not an entirely accurate description, sublimation may be conveniently
modeled as a sequential two-step process of melting followed by vaporization in order to apply Hess’s Law. Viewed
in this manner, the enthalpy of sublimation for a substance may be estimated as the sum of its enthalpies of fusion and

vaporization, as illustrated in Figure 10.28. For example:
solid ⟶ liquid ΔHfus
liquid ⟶ gas ΔHvap
solid ⟶ gas ΔHsub = ΔHfus + ΔHvap
Figure 10.28 For a given substance, the sum of its enthalpy of fusion and enthalpy of vaporization is approximately
equal to its enthalpy of sublimation.
Heating and Cooling Curves
In the chapter on thermochemistry, the relation between the amount of heat absorbed or released by a substance, q,
and its accompanying temperature change, ΔT, was introduced:
q = mcΔT
where m is the mass of the substance and c is its specific heat. The relation applies to matter being heated or cooled,
but not undergoing a change in state. When a substance being heated or cooled reaches a temperature corresponding
to one of its phase transitions, further gain or loss of heat is a result of diminishing or enhancing intermolecular
attractions, instead of increasing or decreasing molecular kinetic energies. While a substance is undergoing a change
in state, its temperature remains constant. Figure 10.29 shows a typical heating curve.
Consider the example of heating a pot of water to boiling. A stove burner will supply heat at a roughly constant rate;
initially, this heat serves to increase the water’s temperature. When the water reaches its boiling point, the temperature
remains constant despite the continued input of heat from the stove burner. This same temperature is maintained
by the water as long as it is boiling. If the burner setting is increased to provide heat at a greater rate, the water
temperature does not rise, but instead the boiling becomes more vigorous (rapid). This behavior is observed for other
phase transitions as well: For example, temperature remains constant while the change of state is in progress.
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 549
Figure 10.29 A typical heating curve for a substance depicts changes in temperature that result as the substance
absorbs increasing amounts of heat. Plateaus in the curve (regions of constant temperature) are exhibited when the
substance undergoes phase transitions.

The transition described involves the following steps:
1. Heat ice from −15 °C to 0 °C
2. Melt ice
3. Heat water from 0 °C to 100 °C
4. Boil water
5. Heat steam from 100 °C to 120 °C
The heat needed to change the temperature of a given substance (with no change in phase) is: q = m × c ×
ΔT (see previous chapter on thermochemistry). The heat needed to induce a given change in phase is given
by q = n × ΔH.
Using these equations with the appropriate values for specific heat of ice, water, and steam, and enthalpies
of fusion and vaporization, we have:

10.4 Phase Diagrams
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the construction and use of a typical phase diagram
• Use phase diagrams to identify stable phases at given temperatures and pressures, and to describe phase
transitions resulting from changes in these properties
• Describe the supercritical fluid phase of matter
In the previous module, the variation of a liquid’s equilibrium vapor pressure with temperature was described.
Considering the definition of boiling point, plots of vapor pressure versus temperature represent how the boiling point
of the liquid varies with pressure. Also described was the use of heating and cooling curves to determine a substance’s
melting (or freezing) point. Making such measurements over a wide range of pressures yields data that may be
presented graphically as a phase diagram. A phase diagram combines plots of pressure versus temperature for the
liquid-gas, solid-liquid, and solid-gas phase-transition equilibria of a substance. These diagrams indicate the physical
states that exist under specific conditions of pressure and temperature, and also provide the pressure dependence of
the phase-transition temperatures (melting points, sublimation points, boiling points). A typical phase diagram for a
pure substance is shown in Figure 10.30.
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 551
Figure 10.30 The physical state of a substance and its phase-transition temperatures are represented graphically in
a phase diagram.
To illustrate the utility of these plots, consider the phase diagram for water shown in Figure 10.31.
Figure 10.31 The pressure and temperature axes on this phase diagram of water are not drawn to constant scale in
order to illustrate several important properties.
We can use the phase diagram to identify the physical state of a sample of water under specified conditions of
pressure and temperature. For example, a pressure of 50 kPa and a temperature of −10 °C correspond to the region
of the diagram labeled “ice.” Under these conditions, water exists only as a solid (ice). A pressure of 50 kPa and a
temperature of 50 °C correspond to the “water” region—here, water exists only as a liquid. At 25 kPa and 200 °C,
water exists only in the gaseous state. Note that on the H2O phase diagram, the pressure and temperature axes are not
drawn to a constant scale in order to permit the illustration of several important features as described here.
552 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids

The curve BC in Figure 10.31 is the plot of vapor pressure versus temperature as described in the previous module
of this chapter. This “liquid-vapor” curve separates the liquid and gaseous regions of the phase diagram and provides
the boiling point for water at any pressure. For example, at 1 atm, the boiling point is 100 °C. Notice that the liquid-
vapor curve terminates at a temperature of 374 °C and a pressure of 218 atm, indicating that water cannot exist as a
liquid above this temperature, regardless of the pressure. The physical properties of water under these conditions are
intermediate between those of its liquid and gaseous phases. This unique state of matter is called a supercritical fluid,
a topic that will be described in the next section of this module.
The solid-vapor curve, labeled AB in Figure 10.31, indicates the temperatures and pressures at which ice and water
vapor are in equilibrium. These temperature-pressure data pairs correspond to the sublimation, or deposition, points
for water. If we could zoom in on the solid-gas line in Figure 10.31, we would see that ice has a vapor pressure of
about 0.20 kPa at −10 °C. Thus, if we place a frozen sample in a vacuum with a pressure less than 0.20 kPa, ice will
sublime. This is the basis for the “freeze-drying” process often used to preserve foods, such as the ice cream shown
in Figure 10.32.
Figure 10.32 Freeze-dried foods, like this ice cream, are dehydrated by sublimation at pressures below the triple
point for water. (credit: ʺlwaoʺ/Flickr)
The solid-liquid curve labeled BD shows the temperatures and pressures at which ice and liquid water are in
equilibrium, representing the melting/freezing points for water. Note that this curve exhibits a slight negative slope
(greatly exaggerated for clarity), indicating that the melting point for water decreases slightly as pressure increases.
Water is an unusual substance in this regard, as most substances exhibit an increase in melting point with increasing
pressure. This behavior is partly responsible for the movement of glaciers, like the one shown in Figure 10.33. The
bottom of a glacier experiences an immense pressure due to its weight that can melt some of the ice, forming a layer
of liquid water on which the glacier may more easily slide.
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 553
Figure 10.33 The immense pressures beneath glaciers result in partial melting to produce a layer of water that
provides lubrication to assist glacial movement. This satellite photograph shows the advancing edge of the Perito
Moreno glacier in Argentina. (credit: NASA)
The point of intersection of all three curves is labeled B in Figure 10.31. At the pressure and temperature represented
by this point, all three phases of water coexist in equilibrium. This temperature-pressure data pair is called the triple
point. At pressures lower than the triple point, water cannot exist as a liquid, regardless of the temperature.

Using the phase diagram for water, we can determine that the state of water at each temperature and pressure
given are as follows: (a) solid; (b) liquid; (c) liquid; (d) gas; (e) solid; (f) gas.

Answer: At 0.3 kPa: s ⟶ g at −58 °C. At 50 kPa: s ⟶ l at 0 °C, l ⟶ g at 78 °C
Consider the phase diagram for carbon dioxide shown in Figure 10.34 as another example. The solid-liquid curve
exhibits a positive slope, indicating that the melting point for CO2 increases with pressure as it does for most
substances (water being a notable exception as described previously). Notice that the triple point is well above 1 atm,
indicating that carbon dioxide cannot exist as a liquid under ambient pressure conditions. Instead, cooling gaseous
carbon dioxide at 1 atm results in its deposition into the solid state. Likewise, solid carbon dioxide does not melt at
1 atm pressure but instead sublimes to yield gaseous CO2. Finally, notice that the critical point for carbon dioxide is

phase changes occur?
Answer: at 1500 kPa: s ⟶ l at −55 °C, l ⟶ g at −10 °C; at 500 kPa: s ⟶ g at −60 °C
Supercritical Fluids
If we place a sample of water in a sealed container at 25 °C, remove the air, and let the vaporization-condensation
equilibrium establish itself, we are left with a mixture of liquid water and water vapor at a pressure of 0.03 atm.
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 555
A distinct boundary between the more dense liquid and the less dense gas is clearly observed. As we increase the
temperature, the pressure of the water vapor increases, as described by the liquid-gas curve in the phase diagram for
water (Figure 10.31), and a two-phase equilibrium of liquid and gaseous phases remains. At a temperature of 374
°C, the vapor pressure has risen to 218 atm, and any further increase in temperature results in the disappearance of the
boundary between liquid and vapor phases. All of the water in the container is now present in a single phase whose
physical properties are intermediate between those of the gaseous and liquid states. This phase of matter is called
a supercritical fluid, and the temperature and pressure above which this phase exists is the critical point (Figure
10.35). Above its critical temperature, a gas cannot be liquefied no matter how much pressure is applied. The pressure
required to liquefy a gas at its critical temperature is called the critical pressure. The critical temperatures and critical
pressures of some common substances are given in the following table.
Substance Critical Temperature (°C) Critical Pressure (kPa)
hydrogen −240.0 1300
nitrogen −147.2 3400
oxygen −118.9 5000
carbon dioxide 31.1 7400
ammonia 132.4 11,300
sulfur dioxide 157.2 7800
water 374.0 22,000

the formation of the supercritical fluid phase. Cooling the supercritical fluid lowers its temperature and pressure below

Like a gas, a supercritical fluid will expand and fill a container, but its density is much greater than typical
gas densities, typically being close to those for liquids. Similar to liquids, these fluids are capable of dissolving
nonvolatile solutes. They exhibit essentially no surface tension and very low viscosities, however, so they can more

effectively penetrate very small openings in a solid mixture and remove soluble components. These properties make
supercritical fluids extremely useful solvents for a wide range of applications. For example, supercritical carbon
dioxide has become a very popular solvent in the food industry, being used to decaffeinate coffee, remove fats from
potato chips, and extract flavor and fragrance compounds from citrus oils. It is nontoxic, relatively inexpensive, and
not considered to be a pollutant. After use, the CO2 can be easily recovered by reducing the pressure and collecting
the resulting gas.
Example 10.13
The Critical Temperature of Carbon Dioxide
If we shake a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher on a cool day (18 °C), we can hear liquid CO2 sloshing around
inside the cylinder. However, the same cylinder appears to contain no liquid on a hot summer day (35 °C).
Explain these observations.
Solution
On the cool day, the temperature of the CO2 is below the critical temperature of CO2, 304 K or 31 °C (Table
10.3), so liquid CO2 is present in the cylinder. On the hot day, the temperature of the CO2 is greater than its
critical temperature of 31 °C. Above this temperature no amount of pressure can liquefy CO2 so no liquid
CO2 exists in the fire extinguisher.

Ammonia can be liquefied by compression at room temperature; oxygen cannot be liquefied under these
conditions. Why do the two gases exhibit different behavior?
Answer: The critical temperature of ammonia is 405.5 K, which is higher than room temperature. The
critical temperature of oxygen is below room temperature; thus oxygen cannot be liquefied at room
temperature.
Decaffeinating Coffee Using Supercritical CO2
Coffee is the world’s second most widely traded commodity, following only petroleum. Across the globe, people
love coffee’s aroma and taste. Many of us also depend on one component of coffee—caffeine—to help us get
going in the morning or stay alert in the afternoon. But late in the day, coffee’s stimulant effect can keep you
from sleeping, so you may choose to drink decaffeinated coffee in the evening.
Since the early 1900s, many methods have been used to decaffeinate coffee. All have advantages and
disadvantages, and all depend on the physical and chemical properties of caffeine. Because caffeine is
a somewhat polar molecule, it dissolves well in water, a polar liquid. However, since many of the other
400-plus compounds that contribute to coffee’s taste and aroma also dissolve in H2O, hot water decaffeination
processes can also remove some of these compounds, adversely affecting the smell and taste of the
decaffeinated coffee. Dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and ethyl acetate (CH3CO2C2H5) have similar polarity to
caffeine, and are therefore very effective solvents for caffeine extraction, but both also remove some flavor
and aroma components, and their use requires long extraction and cleanup times. Because both of these
solvents are toxic, health concerns have been raised regarding the effect of residual solvent remaining in the
decaffeinated coffee.
Supercritical fluid extraction using carbon dioxide is now being widely used as a more effective and
environmentally friendly decaffeination method (Figure 10.36). At temperatures above 304.2 K and pressures
above 7376 kPa, CO2 is a supercritical fluid, with properties of both gas and liquid. Like a gas, it penetrates
deep into the coffee beans; like a liquid, it effectively dissolves certain substances. Supercritical carbon
dioxide extraction of steamed coffee beans removes 97−99% of the caffeine, leaving coffee’s flavor and aroma
Chemistry in Everyday Life
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 557
compounds intact. Because CO2 is a gas under standard conditions, its removal from the extracted coffee
beans is easily accomplished, as is the recovery of the caffeine from the extract. The caffeine recovered from
coffee beans via this process is a valuable product that can be used subsequently as an additive to other foods
or drugs.
Figure 10.36 (a) Caffeine molecules have both polar and nonpolar regions, making it soluble in solvents of
varying polarities. (b) The schematic shows a typical decaffeination process involving supercritical carbon
dioxide.
10.5 The Solid State of Matter
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define and describe the bonding and properties of ionic, molecular, metallic, and covalent network
crystalline solids
• Describe the main types of crystalline solids: ionic solids, metallic solids, covalent network solids, and
molecular solids
• Explain the ways in which crystal defects can occur in a solid
When most liquids are cooled, they eventually freeze and form crystalline solids, solids in which the atoms, ions,
or molecules are arranged in a definite repeating pattern. It is also possible for a liquid to freeze before its molecules
become arranged in an orderly pattern. The resulting materials are called amorphous solids or noncrystalline solids
(or, sometimes, glasses). The particles of such solids lack an ordered internal structure and are randomly arranged
(Figure 10.37).
558 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Figure 10.37 The entities of a solid phase may be arranged in a regular, repeating pattern (crystalline solids) or
randomly (amorphous).
Metals and ionic compounds typically form ordered, crystalline solids. Substances that consist of large molecules, or
a mixture of molecules whose movements are more restricted, often form amorphous solids. For examples, candle
waxes are amorphous solids composed of large hydrocarbon molecules. Some substances, such as silicon dioxide
(shown in Figure 10.38), can form either crystalline or amorphous solids, depending on the conditions under which
it is produced. Also, amorphous solids may undergo a transition to the crystalline state under appropriate conditions.
Figure 10.38 (a) Silicon dioxide, SiO2, is abundant in nature as one of several crystalline forms of the mineral
quartz. (b) Rapid cooling of molten SiO2 yields an amorphous solid known as “fused silica”.
Crystalline solids are generally classified according the nature of the forces that hold its particles together. These
forces are primarily responsible for the physical properties exhibited by the bulk solids. The following sections
provide descriptions of the major types of crystalline solids: ionic, metallic, covalent network, and molecular.
Ionic Solids
Ionic solids, such as sodium chloride and nickel oxide, are composed of positive and negative ions that are held
together by electrostatic attractions, which can be quite strong (Figure 10.39). Many ionic crystals also have high
melting points. This is due to the very strong attractions between the ions—in ionic compounds, the attractions
between full charges are (much) larger than those between the partial charges in polar molecular compounds. This
will be looked at in more detail in a later discussion of lattice energies. Although they are hard, they also tend to
be brittle, and they shatter rather than bend. Ionic solids do not conduct electricity; however, they do conduct when
molten or dissolved because their ions are free to move. Many simple compounds formed by the reaction of a metallic
element with a nonmetallic element are ionic.
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 559
Figure 10.39 Sodium chloride is an ionic solid.
Metallic Solids
Metallic solids such as crystals of copper, aluminum, and iron are formed by metal atoms Figure 10.40. The
structure of metallic crystals is often described as a uniform distribution of atomic nuclei within a “sea” of delocalized
electrons. The atoms within such a metallic solid are held together by a unique force known as metallic bonding that
gives rise to many useful and varied bulk properties. All exhibit high thermal and electrical conductivity, metallic
luster, and malleability. Many are very hard and quite strong. Because of their malleability (the ability to deform
under pressure or hammering), they do not shatter and, therefore, make useful construction materials. The melting
points of the metals vary widely. Mercury is a liquid at room temperature, and the alkali metals melt below 200 °C.
Several post-transition metals also have low melting points, whereas the transition metals melt at temperatures above
1000 °C. These differences reflect differences in strengths of metallic bonding among the metals.
Figure 10.40 Copper is a metallic solid.
Covalent Network Solid
Covalent network solids include crystals of diamond, silicon, some other nonmetals, and some covalent compounds
such as silicon dioxide (sand) and silicon carbide (carborundum, the abrasive on sandpaper). Many minerals have
networks of covalent bonds. The atoms in these solids are held together by a network of covalent bonds, as shown in
Figure 10.41. To break or to melt a covalent network solid, covalent bonds must be broken. Because covalent bonds
are relatively strong, covalent network solids are typically characterized by hardness, strength, and high melting
points. For example, diamond is one of the hardest substances known and melts above 3500 °C.
560 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Figure 10.41 A covalent crystal contains a three-dimensional network of covalent bonds, as illustrated by the
structures of diamond, silicon dioxide, silicon carbide, and graphite. Graphite is an exceptional example, composed of
planar sheets of covalent crystals that are held together in layers by noncovalent forces. Unlike typical covalent
solids, graphite is very soft and electrically conductive.
Molecular Solid
Molecular solids, such as ice, sucrose (table sugar), and iodine, as shown in Figure 10.42, are composed of
neutral molecules. The strengths of the attractive forces between the units present in different crystals vary widely,
as indicated by the melting points of the crystals. Small symmetrical molecules (nonpolar molecules), such as H2,
N2, O2, and F2, have weak attractive forces and form molecular solids with very low melting points (below −200
°C). Substances consisting of larger, nonpolar molecules have larger attractive forces and melt at higher temperatures.
Molecular solids composed of molecules with permanent dipole moments (polar molecules) melt at still higher
temperatures. Examples include ice (melting point, 0 °C) and table sugar (melting point, 185 °C).
Figure 10.42 Carbon dioxide (CO2) consists of small, nonpolar molecules and forms a molecular solid with a melting
point of −78 °C. Iodine (I2) consists of larger, nonpolar molecules and forms a molecular solid that melts at 114 °C.
Properties of Solids
A crystalline solid, like those listed in Table 10.4, has a precise melting temperature because each atom or molecule
of the same type is held in place with the same forces or energy. Thus, the attractions between the units that make up
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 561
the crystal all have the same strength and all require the same amount of energy to be broken. The gradual softening
of an amorphous material differs dramatically from the distinct melting of a crystalline solid. This results from the
structural nonequivalence of the molecules in the amorphous solid. Some forces are weaker than others, and when
an amorphous material is heated, the weakest intermolecular attractions break first. As the temperature is increased
further, the stronger attractions are broken. Thus amorphous materials soften over a range of temperatures.

Carbon is an essential element in our world. The unique properties of carbon atoms allow the existence of
carbon-based life forms such as ourselves. Carbon forms a huge variety of substances that we use on a daily
basis, including those shown in Figure 10.43. You may be familiar with diamond and graphite, the two most
common allotropes of carbon. (Allotropes are different structural forms of the same element.) Diamond is one
of the hardest-known substances, whereas graphite is soft enough to be used as pencil lead. These very
different properties stem from the different arrangements of the carbon atoms in the different allotropes.

States Geological Survey)
You may be less familiar with a recently discovered form of carbon: graphene. Graphene was first isolated in
2004 by using tape to peel off thinner and thinner layers from graphite. It is essentially a single sheet (one
atom thick) of graphite. Graphene, illustrated in Figure 10.44, is not only strong and lightweight, but it is also
an excellent conductor of electricity and heat. These properties may prove very useful in a wide range of
applications, such as vastly improved computer chips and circuits, better batteries and solar cells, and stronger
and lighter structural materials. The 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Andre Geim and Konstantin
Novoselov for their pioneering work with graphene.

Figure 10.44 Graphene sheets can be formed into buckyballs, nanotubes, and stacked layers.
Crystal Defects
In a crystalline solid, the atoms, ions, or molecules are arranged in a definite repeating pattern, but occasional
defects may occur in the pattern. Several types of defects are known, as illustrated in Figure 10.45. Vacancies are
defects that occur when positions that should contain atoms or ions are vacant. Less commonly, some atoms or ions
in a crystal may occupy positions, called interstitial sites, located between the regular positions for atoms. Other
distortions are found in impure crystals, as, for example, when the cations, anions, or molecules of the impurity are
too large to fit into the regular positions without distorting the structure. Trace amounts of impurities are sometimes
added to a crystal (a process known as doping) in order to create defects in the structure that yield desirable changes
in its properties. For example, silicon crystals are doped with varying amounts of different elements to yield suitable
electrical properties for their use in the manufacture of semiconductors and computer chips.

10.6 Lattice Structures in Crystalline Solids
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the arrangement of atoms and ions in crystalline structures
• Compute ionic radii using unit cell dimensions
• Explain the use of X-ray diffraction measurements in determining crystalline structures
Over 90% of naturally occurring and man-made solids are crystalline. Most solids form with a regular arrangement of
their particles because the overall attractive interactions between particles are maximized, and the total intermolecular
energy is minimized, when the particles pack in the most efficient manner. The regular arrangement at an atomic level
is often reflected at a macroscopic level. In this module, we will explore some of the details about the structures of
metallic and ionic crystalline solids, and learn how these structures are determined experimentally.
The Structures of Metals
We will begin our discussion of crystalline solids by considering elemental metals, which are relatively simple
because each contains only one type of atom. A pure metal is a crystalline solid with metal atoms packed closely
together in a repeating pattern. Some of the properties of metals in general, such as their malleability and ductility, are
largely due to having identical atoms arranged in a regular pattern. The different properties of one metal compared to
another partially depend on the sizes of their atoms and the specifics of their spatial arrangements. We will explore
the similarities and differences of four of the most common metal crystal geometries in the sections that follow.
Unit Cells of Metals
The structure of a crystalline solid, whether a metal or not, is best described by considering its simplest repeating unit,
which is referred to as its unit cell. The unit cell consists of lattice points that represent the locations of atoms or ions.
The entire structure then consists of this unit cell repeating in three dimensions, as illustrated in Figure 10.46.
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 565
Figure 10.46 A unit cell shows the locations of lattice points repeating in all directions.
Let us begin our investigation of crystal lattice structure and unit cells with the most straightforward structure and the
most basic unit cell. To visualize this, imagine taking a large number of identical spheres, such as tennis balls, and
arranging them uniformly in a container. The simplest way to do this would be to make layers in which the spheres
in one layer are directly above those in the layer below, as illustrated in Figure 10.47. This arrangement is called
simple cubic structure, and the unit cell is called the simple cubic unit cell or primitive cubic unit cell.
Figure 10.47 When metal atoms are arranged with spheres in one layer directly above or below spheres in another
layer, the lattice structure is called simple cubic. Note that the spheres are in contact.
In a simple cubic structure, the spheres are not packed as closely as they could be, and they only “fill” about 52%
of the volume of the container. This is a relatively inefficient arrangement, and only one metal (polonium, Po)
crystallizes in a simple cubic structure. As shown in Figure 10.48, a solid with this type of arrangement consists of
planes (or layers) in which each atom contacts only the four nearest neighbors in its layer; one atom directly above it
in the layer above; and one atom directly below it in the layer below. The number of other particles that each particle
in a crystalline solid contacts is known as its coordination number. For a polonium atom in a simple cubic array, the
coordination number is, therefore, six.
566 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Figure 10.48 An atom in a simple cubic lattice structure contacts six other atoms, so it has a coordination number of
six.
In a simple cubic lattice, the unit cell that repeats in all directions is a cube defined by the centers of eight atoms,
as shown in Figure 10.49. Atoms at adjacent corners of this unit cell contact each other, so the edge length of this
cell is equal to two atomic radii, or one atomic diameter. A cubic unit cell contains only the parts of these atoms that
are within it. Since an atom at a corner of a simple cubic unit cell is contained by a total of eight unit cells, only
one-eighth of that atom is within a specific unit cell. And since each simple cubic unit cell has one atom at each of its
eight “corners,” there is 8 × 1
8 = 1 atom within one simple cubic unit cell.
Figure 10.49 A simple cubic lattice unit cell contains one-eighth of an atom at each of its eight corners, so it
contains one atom total.

Calculation of Atomic Radius and Density for Metals, Part 1
The edge length of the unit cell of alpha polonium is 336 pm.
(a) Determine the radius of a polonium atom.
(b) Determine the density of alpha polonium.
Solution
Alpha polonium crystallizes in a simple cubic unit cell:
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 567
(a) Two adjacent Po atoms contact each other, so the edge length of this cell is equal to two Po atomic radii:
l = 2r. Therefore, the radius of Po is r = l
2 = 336 pm
2 = 168 pm.
(b) Density is given by density = mass
volume. The density of polonium can be found by determining the
density of its unit cell (the mass contained within a unit cell divided by the volume of the unit cell). Since a
Po unit cell contains one-eighth of a Po atom at each of its eight corners, a unit cell contains one Po atom.
The mass of a Po unit cell can be found by:
1 Po unit cell × 1 Po atom
1 Po unit cell × 1 mol Po
6.022 × 1023 Po atoms × 208.998 g
1 mol Po = 3.47 × 10−22 g
The volume of a Po unit cell can be found by:
V = l3 = ⎛
⎝336 × 10−10 cm⎞
⎠
3
= 3.79 × 10−23 cm3
(Note that the edge length was converted from pm to cm to get the usual volume units for density.)
Therefore, the density of Po = 3.471 × 10−22 g
3.79 × 10−23 cm3 = 9.16 g/cm3

The edge length of the unit cell for nickel is 0.3524 nm. The density of Ni is 8.90 g/cm3. Does nickel
crystallize in a simple cubic structure? Explain.
Answer: No. If Ni was simple cubic, its density would be given by:
1 Ni atom × 1 mol Ni
6.022 × 1023 Ni atoms × 58.693 g
1 mol Ni = 9.746 × 10−23 g
V = l3 = ⎛
⎝3.524 × 10−8 cm⎞
⎠
3
= 4.376 × 10−23 cm3
Then the density of Ni would be = 9.746 × 10−23 g
4.376 × 10−23 cm3 = 2.23 g/cm3
Since the actual density of Ni is not close to this, Ni does not form a simple cubic structure.
Most metal crystals are one of the four major types of unit cells. For now, we will focus on the three cubic unit cells:
simple cubic (which we have already seen), body-centered cubic unit cell, and face-centered cubic unit cell—all
of which are illustrated in Figure 10.50. (Note that there are actually seven different lattice systems, some of which
have more than one type of lattice, for a total of 14 different types of unit cells. We leave the more complicated
geometries for later in this module.)

Figure 10.50 Cubic unit cells of metals show (in the upper figures) the locations of lattice points and (in the lower
figures) metal atoms located in the unit cell.
Some metals crystallize in an arrangement that has a cubic unit cell with atoms at all of the corners and an atom in the
center, as shown in Figure 10.51. This is called a body-centered cubic (BCC) solid. Atoms in the corners of a BCC
unit cell do not contact each other but contact the atom in the center. A BCC unit cell contains two atoms: one-eighth
of an atom at each of the eight corners (8 × 1
8 = 1 atom from the corners) plus one atom from the center. Any atom
in this structure touches four atoms in the layer above it and four atoms in the layer below it. Thus, an atom in a BCC
structure has a coordination number of eight.
Figure 10.51 In a body-centered cubic structure, atoms in a specific layer do not touch each other. Each atom
touches four atoms in the layer above it and four atoms in the layer below it.
Atoms in BCC arrangements are much more efficiently packed than in a simple cubic structure, occupying about 68%
of the total volume. Isomorphous metals with a BCC structure include K, Ba, Cr, Mo, W, and Fe at room temperature.
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 569
(Elements or compounds that crystallize with the same structure are said to be isomorphous.)
Many other metals, such as aluminum, copper, and lead, crystallize in an arrangement that has a cubic unit cell with
atoms at all of the corners and at the centers of each face, as illustrated in Figure 10.52. This arrangement is called
a face-centered cubic (FCC) solid. A FCC unit cell contains four atoms: one-eighth of an atom at each of the eight
corners (8 × 1
8 = 1 atom from the corners) and one-half of an atom on each of the six faces (6 × 1
2 = 3 atoms from
the faces). The atoms at the corners touch the atoms in the centers of the adjacent faces along the face diagonals of
the cube. Because the atoms are on identical lattice points, they have identical environments.
Figure 10.52 A face-centered cubic solid has atoms at the corners and, as the name implies, at the centers of the
faces of its unit cells.
Atoms in an FCC arrangement are packed as closely together as possible, with atoms occupying 74% of the volume.
This structure is also called cubic closest packing (CCP). In CCP, there are three repeating layers of hexagonally
arranged atoms. Each atom contacts six atoms in its own layer, three in the layer above, and three in the layer below.
In this arrangement, each atom touches 12 near neighbors, and therefore has a coordination number of 12. The fact
that FCC and CCP arrangements are equivalent may not be immediately obvious, but why they are actually the same
structure is illustrated in Figure 10.53.
Figure 10.53 A CCP arrangement consists of three repeating layers (ABCABC…) of hexagonally arranged atoms.
Atoms in a CCP structure have a coordination number of 12 because they contact six atoms in their layer, plus three
atoms in the layer above and three atoms in the layer below. By rotating our perspective, we can see that a CCP
structure has a unit cell with a face containing an atom from layer A at one corner, atoms from layer B across a
diagonal (at two corners and in the middle of the face), and an atom from layer C at the remaining corner. This is the
same as a face-centered cubic arrangement.

Because closer packing maximizes the overall attractions between atoms and minimizes the total intermolecular
energy, the atoms in most metals pack in this manner. We find two types of closest packing in simple metallic
crystalline structures: CCP, which we have already encountered, and hexagonal closest packing (HCP) shown in
Figure 10.54. Both consist of repeating layers of hexagonally arranged atoms. In both types, a second layer (B) is
placed on the first layer (A) so that each atom in the second layer is in contact with three atoms in the first layer.
The third layer is positioned in one of two ways. In HCP, atoms in the third layer are directly above atoms in the
first layer (i.e., the third layer is also type A), and the stacking consists of alternating type A and type B close-packed
layers (i.e., ABABAB⋯). In CCP, atoms in the third layer are not above atoms in either of the first two layers (i.e.,
the third layer is type C), and the stacking consists of alternating type A, type B, and type C close-packed layers (i.e.,
ABCABCABC⋯). About two–thirds of all metals crystallize in closest-packed arrays with coordination numbers of
12. Metals that crystallize in an HCP structure include Cd, Co, Li, Mg, Na, and Zn, and metals that crystallize in a
CCP structure include Ag, Al, Ca, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Pt.
Figure 10.54 In both types of closest packing, atoms are packed as compactly as possible. Hexagonal closest
packing consists of two alternating layers (ABABAB…). Cubic closest packing consists of three alternating layers
(ABCABCABC…).

Calcium crystallizes in a face-centered cubic structure. The edge length of its unit cell is 558.8 pm.
(a) What is the atomic radius of Ca in this structure?
(b) Calculate the density of Ca.
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 571
Solution
(a) In an FCC structure, Ca atoms contact each other across the diagonal of the face, so the length of the
diagonal is equal to four Ca atomic radii (d = 4r). Two adjacent edges and the diagonal of the face form a
right triangle, with the length of each side equal to 558.8 pm and the length of the hypotenuse equal to four
Ca atomic radii:
a2 + a2 = d2 ⟶ ⎛
⎝558.8 pm⎞
⎠
2 + ⎛
⎝558.5 pm⎞
⎠
2 = (4r)2
Solving this gives r = ⎛
⎝558.8 pm⎞
⎠
2 + ⎛
⎝558.5 pm⎞
⎠
2
16 = 197.6 pm for a Ca radius.
(b) Density is given by density = mass
volume. The density of calcium can be found by determining the density
of its unit cell: for example, the mass contained within a unit cell divided by the volume of the unit cell.
A face-centered Ca unit cell has one-eighth of an atom at each of the eight corners (8 × 1
8 = 1 atom) and
one-half of an atom on each of the six faces 6 × 1
2 = 3 atoms), for a total of four atoms in the unit cell.
The mass of the unit cell can be found by:
1 Ca unit cell × 4 Ca atoms
1 Ca unit cell × 1 mol Ca
6.022 × 1023 Ca atoms × 40.078 g
1 mol Ca = 2.662 × 10−22 g
The volume of a Ca unit cell can be found by:
V = a3 = ⎛
⎝558.8 × 10−10 cm⎞
⎠
3
= 1.745 × 10−22 cm3
(Note that the edge length was converted from pm to cm to get the usual volume units for density.)
Then, the density of Ca = 2.662 × 10−22 g
1.745 × 10−22 cm3 = 1.53 g/cm3

In general, a unit cell is defined by the lengths of three axes (a, b, and c) and the angles (α, β, and γ) between
them, as illustrated in Figure 10.55. The axes are defined as being the lengths between points in the space lattice.
Consequently, unit cell axes join points with identical environments.

The Structures of Ionic Crystals
Ionic crystals consist of two or more different kinds of ions that usually have different sizes. The packing of these
574 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
ions into a crystal structure is more complex than the packing of metal atoms that are the same size.
Most monatomic ions behave as charged spheres, and their attraction for ions of opposite charge is the same in every
direction. Consequently, stable structures for ionic compounds result (1) when ions of one charge are surrounded
by as many ions as possible of the opposite charge and (2) when the cations and anions are in contact with each
other. Structures are determined by two principal factors: the relative sizes of the ions and the ratio of the numbers of
positive and negative ions in the compound.
In simple ionic structures, we usually find the anions, which are normally larger than the cations, arranged in a
closest-packed array. (As seen previously, additional electrons attracted to the same nucleus make anions larger and
fewer electrons attracted to the same nucleus make cations smaller when compared to the atoms from which they
are formed.) The smaller cations commonly occupy one of two types of holes (or interstices) remaining between the
anions. The smaller of the holes is found between three anions in one plane and one anion in an adjacent plane. The
four anions surrounding this hole are arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron, so the hole is called a tetrahedral hole.
The larger type of hole is found at the center of six anions (three in one layer and three in an adjacent layer) located at
the corners of an octahedron; this is called an octahedral hole. Figure 10.57 illustrates both of these types of holes.
Figure 10.57 Cations may occupy two types of holes between anions: octahedral holes or tetrahedral holes.
Depending on the relative sizes of the cations and anions, the cations of an ionic compound may occupy tetrahedral or
octahedral holes, as illustrated in Figure 10.58. Relatively small cations occupy tetrahedral holes, and larger cations
occupy octahedral holes. If the cations are too large to fit into the octahedral holes, the anions may adopt a more open
structure, such as a simple cubic array. The larger cations can then occupy the larger cubic holes made possible by the
more open spacing.
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 575
Figure 10.58 A cation’s size and the shape of the hole occupied by the compound are directly related.
There are two tetrahedral holes for each anion in either an HCP or CCP array of anions. A compound that crystallizes
in a closest-packed array of anions with cations in the tetrahedral holes can have a maximum cation:anion ratio of 2:1;
all of the tetrahedral holes are filled at this ratio. Examples include Li2O, Na2O, Li2S, and Na2S. Compounds with a
ratio of less than 2:1 may also crystallize in a closest-packed array of anions with cations in the tetrahedral holes, if
the ionic sizes fit. In these compounds, however, some of the tetrahedral holes remain vacant.
Example 10.16
Occupancy of Tetrahedral Holes
Zinc sulfide is an important industrial source of zinc and is also used as a white pigment in paint. Zinc
sulfide crystallizes with zinc ions occupying one-half of the tetrahedral holes in a closest-packed array of
sulfide ions. What is the formula of zinc sulfide?
Solution
Because there are two tetrahedral holes per anion (sulfide ion) and one-half of these holes are occupied by
zinc ions, there must be 1
2 × 2, or 1, zinc ion per sulfide ion. Thus, the formula is ZnS.
Check Your Learning
Lithium selenide can be described as a closest-packed array of selenide ions with lithium ions in all of the
tetrahedral holes. What it the formula of lithium selenide?
Answer: Li2Se
The ratio of octahedral holes to anions in either an HCP or CCP structure is 1:1. Thus, compounds with cations in
octahedral holes in a closest-packed array of anions can have a maximum cation:anion ratio of 1:1. In NiO, MnS,
NaCl, and KH, for example, all of the octahedral holes are filled. Ratios of less than 1:1 are observed when some of
the octahedral holes remain empty.
Example 10.17
Stoichiometry of Ionic Compounds
Sapphire is aluminum oxide. Aluminum oxide crystallizes with aluminum ions in two-thirds of the
octahedral holes in a closest-packed array of oxide ions. What is the formula of aluminum oxide?
576 Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Solution
Because there is one octahedral hole per anion (oxide ion) and only two-thirds of these holes are occupied,
the ratio of aluminum to oxygen must be 2
3 :1, which would give Al2/3 O. The simplest whole number ratio
is 2:3, so the formula is Al2O3.

The white pigment titanium oxide crystallizes with titanium ions in one-half of the octahedral holes in a
closest-packed array of oxide ions. What is the formula of titanium oxide?
Answer: TiO2
In a simple cubic array of anions, there is one cubic hole that can be occupied by a cation for each anion in the array.
In CsCl, and in other compounds with the same structure, all of the cubic holes are occupied. Half of the cubic holes
are occupied in SrH2, UO2, SrCl2, and CaF2.
Different types of ionic compounds often crystallize in the same structure when the relative sizes of their ions and
their stoichiometries (the two principal features that determine structure) are similar.
Unit Cells of Ionic Compounds
Many ionic compounds crystallize with cubic unit cells, and we will use these compounds to describe the general
features of ionic structures.
When an ionic compound is composed of cations and anions of similar size in a 1:1 ratio, it typically forms a simple
cubic structure. Cesium chloride, CsCl, (illustrated in Figure 10.59) is an example of this, with Cs+ and Cl− having
radii of 174 pm and 181 pm, respectively. We can think of this as chloride ions forming a simple cubic unit cell,
with a cesium ion in the center; or as cesium ions forming a unit cell with a chloride ion in the center; or as simple
cubic unit cells formed by Cs+ ions overlapping unit cells formed by Cl− ions. Cesium ions and chloride ions touch
along the body diagonals of the unit cells. One cesium ion and one chloride ion are present per unit cell, giving the l:l
stoichiometry required by the formula for cesium chloride. Note that there is no lattice point in the center of the cell,
and CsCl is not a BCC structure because a cesium ion is not identical to a chloride ion.
Figure 10.59 Ionic compounds with similar-sized cations and anions, such as CsCl, usually form a simple cubic
structure. They can be described by unit cells with either cations at the corners or anions at the corners.
We have said that the location of lattice points is arbitrary. This is illustrated by an alternate description of the CsCl
structure in which the lattice points are located in the centers of the cesium ions. In this description, the cesium ions
are located on the lattice points at the corners of the cell, and the chloride ion is located at the center of the cell. The
two unit cells are different, but they describe identical structures.
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 577
When an ionic compound is composed of a 1:1 ratio of cations and anions that differ significantly in size, it typically
crystallizes with an FCC unit cell, like that shown in Figure 10.60. Sodium chloride, NaCl, is an example of this,
with Na+ and Cl− having radii of 102 pm and 181 pm, respectively. We can think of this as chloride ions forming an
FCC cell, with sodium ions located in the octahedral holes in the middle of the cell edges and in the center of the cell.
The sodium and chloride ions touch each other along the cell edges. The unit cell contains four sodium ions and four
chloride ions, giving the 1:1 stoichiometry required by the formula, NaCl.
Figure 10.60 Ionic compounds with anions that are much larger than cations, such as NaCl, usually form an FCC
structure. They can be described by FCC unit cells with cations in the octahedral holes.
The cubic form of zinc sulfide, zinc blende, also crystallizes in an FCC unit cell, as illustrated in Figure 10.61. This
structure contains sulfide ions on the lattice points of an FCC lattice. (The arrangement of sulfide ions is identical to
the arrangement of chloride ions in sodium chloride.) The radius of a zinc ion is only about 40% of the radius of a
sulfide ion, so these small Zn2+ ions are located in alternating tetrahedral holes, that is, in one half of the tetrahedral
holes. There are four zinc ions and four sulfide ions in the unit cell, giving the empirical formula ZnS.
Figure 10.61 ZnS, zinc sulfide (or zinc blende) forms an FCC unit cell with sulfide ions at the lattice points and much
smaller zinc ions occupying half of the tetrahedral holes in the structure.
A calcium fluoride unit cell, like that shown in Figure 10.62, is also an FCC unit cell, but in this case, the cations
are located on the lattice points; equivalent calcium ions are located on the lattice points of an FCC lattice. All of the
tetrahedral sites in the FCC array of calcium ions are occupied by fluoride ions. There are four calcium ions and eight
fluoride ions in a unit cell, giving a calcium:fluorine ratio of 1:2, as required by the chemical formula, CaF2. Close
examination of Figure 10.62 will reveal a simple cubic array of fluoride ions with calcium ions in one half of the
cubic holes. The structure cannot be described in terms of a space lattice of points on the fluoride ions because the
fluoride ions do not all have identical environments. The orientation of the four calcium ions about the fluoride ions

differs.
Figure 10.62 Calcium fluoride, CaF2, forms an FCC unit cell with calcium ions (green) at the lattice points and
fluoride ions (red) occupying all of the tetrahedral sites between them.
Calculation of Ionic Radii
If we know the edge length of a unit cell of an ionic compound and the position of the ions in the cell, we can calculate
ionic radii for the ions in the compound if we make assumptions about individual ionic shapes and contacts.
Example 10.18
Calculation of Ionic Radii
The edge length of the unit cell of LiCl (NaCl-like structure, FCC) is 0.514 nm or 5.14 Å. Assuming that
the lithium ion is small enough so that the chloride ions are in contact, as in Figure 10.60, calculate the
ionic radius for the chloride ion.
Note: The length unit angstrom, Å, is often used to represent atomic-scale dimensions and is equivalent to
10−10 m.
Solution
On the face of a LiCl unit cell, chloride ions contact each other across the diagonal of the face:
Drawing a right triangle on the face of the unit cell, we see that the length of the diagonal is equal to four
chloride radii (one radius from each corner chloride and one diameter—which equals two radii—from the
chloride ion in the center of the face), so d = 4r. From the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
a2 + a2 = d2
which yields:
Chapter 10 | Liquids and Solids 579
(0.514 nm)2 + (0.514 nm)2 = (4r)2 = 16r2
Solving this gives:
r = (0.514 nm)2 + (0.514 nm)2
16 = 0.182 nm (1.82 Å) for a Cl− radius.
Check Your Learning
The edge length of the unit cell of KCl (NaCl-like structure, FCC) is 6.28 Å. Assuming anion-cation contact
along the cell edge, calculate the radius of the potassium ion. The radius of the chloride ion is 1.82 Å.
Answer: The radius of the potassium ion is 1.33 Å.
It is important to realize that values for ionic radii calculated from the edge lengths of unit cells depend on numerous
assumptions, such as a perfect spherical shape for ions, which are approximations at best. Hence, such calculated
values are themselves approximate and comparisons cannot be pushed too far. Nevertheless, this method has proved
useful for calculating ionic radii from experimental measurements such as X-ray crystallographic determinations.
X-Ray Crystallography
The size of the unit cell and the arrangement of atoms in a crystal may be determined from measurements of
the diffraction of X-rays by the crystal, termed X-ray crystallography. Diffraction is the change in the direction
of travel experienced by an electromagnetic wave when it encounters a physical barrier whose dimensions are
comparable to those of the wavelength of the light. X-rays are electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths about as
long as the distance between neighboring atoms in crystals (on the order of a few Å).
When a beam of monochromatic X-rays strikes a crystal, its rays are scattered in all directions by the atoms within
the crystal. When scattered waves traveling in the same direction encounter one another, they undergo interference, a
process by which the waves combine to yield either an increase or a decrease in amplitude (intensity) depending upon
the extent to which the combining waves’ maxima are separated (see Figure 10.63).
Figure 10.63 Light waves occupying the same space experience interference, combining to yield waves of greater
(a) or lesser (b) intensity, depending upon the separation of their maxima and minima.
When X-rays of a certain wavelength, λ, are scattered by atoms in adjacent crystal planes separated by a distance,
d, they may undergo constructive interference when the difference between the distances traveled by the two waves
prior to their combination is an integer factor, n, of the wavelength. This condition is satisfied when the angle of the
diffracted beam, θ, is related to the wavelength and interatomic distance by the equation:
nλ = 2d sin θ
This relation is known as the Bragg equation in honor of W. H. Bragg, the English physicist who first explained
this phenomenon. Figure 10.64 illustrates two examples of diffracted waves from the same two crystal planes. The
figure on the left depicts waves diffracted at the Bragg angle, resulting in constructive interference, while that on
the right shows diffraction and a different angle that does not satisfy the Bragg condition, resulting in destructive
interference.

distance between the atoms. The top image depicts constructive interference between two scattered waves and a

diffracted wave.

simulator that allows you to explore the effect of each variable on the intensity of the diffracted wave.
An X-ray diffractometer, such as the one illustrated in Figure 10.65, may be used to measure the angles at which X-
rays are diffracted when interacting with a crystal as described earlier. From such measurements, the Bragg equation
may be used to compute distances between atoms as demonstrated in the following example exercise.

The distance between the planes is found by solving the Bragg equation, nλ = 2d sin θ, for d.
This gives: d = nλ

X-ray Crystallographer Rosalind Franklin
The discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 by Francis Crick and James Watson is one of the great
achievements in the history of science. They were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine,
along with Maurice Wilkins, who provided experimental proof of DNA’s structure. British chemist Rosalind
Franklin made invaluable contributions to this monumental achievement through her work in measuring X-ray
diffraction images of DNA. Early in her career, Franklin’s research on the structure of coals proved helpful to
the British war effort. After shifting her focus to biological systems in the early 1950s, Franklin and doctoral
student Raymond Gosling discovered that DNA consists of two forms: a long, thin fiber formed when wet (type
“B”) and a short, wide fiber formed when dried (type “A”). Her X-ray diffraction images of DNA (Figure 10.66)
provided the crucial information that allowed Watson and Crick to confirm that DNA forms a double helix, and

RNA that contains their genetic information, uncovering new information that radically changed the body of
knowledge in the field. After developing ovarian cancer, Franklin continued to work until her death in 1958 at
age 37. Among many posthumous recognitions of her work, the Chicago Medical School of Finch University of
Health Sciences changed its name to the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science in 2004, and

Summary
10.1 Intermolecular Forces
The physical properties of condensed matter (liquids and solids) can be explained in terms of the kinetic molecular
theory. In a liquid, intermolecular attractive forces hold the molecules in contact, although they still have sufficient
KE to move past each other.
Intermolecular attractive forces, collectively referred to as van der Waals forces, are responsible for the behavior of
liquids and solids and are electrostatic in nature. Dipole-dipole attractions result from the electrostatic attraction of
the partial negative end of one dipolar molecule for the partial positive end of another. The temporary dipole that
results from the motion of the electrons in an atom can induce a dipole in an adjacent atom and give rise to the London
dispersion force. London forces increase with increasing molecular size. Hydrogen bonds are a special type of dipole-
dipole attraction that results when hydrogen is bonded to one of the three most electronegative elements: F, O, or N.
10.2 Properties of Liquids
The intermolecular forces between molecules in the liquid state vary depending upon their chemical identities
and result in corresponding variations in various physical properties. Cohesive forces between like molecules are
responsible for a liquid’s viscosity (resistance to flow) and surface tension (elasticity of a liquid surface). Adhesive
forces between the molecules of a liquid and different molecules composing a surface in contact with the liquid are
responsible for phenomena such as surface wetting and capillary rise.

10.3 Phase Transitions
Phase transitions are processes that convert matter from one physical state into another. There are six phase
transitions between the three phases of matter. Melting, vaporization, and sublimation are all endothermic processes,
requiring an input of heat to overcome intermolecular attractions. The reciprocal transitions of freezing, condensation,
and deposition are all exothermic processes, involving heat as intermolecular attractive forces are established
or strengthened. The temperatures at which phase transitions occur are determined by the relative strengths of
intermolecular attractions and are, therefore, dependent on the chemical identity of the substance.
10.4 Phase Diagrams
The temperature and pressure conditions at which a substance exists in solid, liquid, and gaseous states are
summarized in a phase diagram for that substance. Phase diagrams are combined plots of three pressure-temperature
equilibrium curves: solid-liquid, liquid-gas, and solid-gas. These curves represent the relationships between phase-
transition temperatures and pressures. The point of intersection of all three curves represents the substance’s triple
point—the temperature and pressure at which all three phases are in equilibrium. At pressures below the triple point, a
substance cannot exist in the liquid state, regardless of its temperature. The terminus of the liquid-gas curve represents
the substance’s critical point, the pressure and temperature above which a liquid phase cannot exist.
10.5 The Solid State of Matter
Some substances form crystalline solids consisting of particles in a very organized structure; others form amorphous
(noncrystalline) solids with an internal structure that is not ordered. The main types of crystalline solids are ionic
solids, metallic solids, covalent network solids, and molecular solids. The properties of the different kinds of
crystalline solids are due to the types of particles of which they consist, the arrangements of the particles, and the
strengths of the attractions between them. Because their particles experience identical attractions, crystalline solids
have distinct melting temperatures; the particles in amorphous solids experience a range of interactions, so they
soften gradually and melt over a range of temperatures. Some crystalline solids have defects in the definite repeating
pattern of their particles. These defects (which include vacancies, atoms or ions not in the regular positions, and
impurities) change physical properties such as electrical conductivity, which is exploited in the silicon crystals used
to manufacture computer chips.
10.6 Lattice Structures in Crystalline Solids
The structures of crystalline metals and simple ionic compounds can be described in terms of packing of spheres.
Metal atoms can pack in hexagonal closest-packed structures, cubic closest-packed structures, body-centered
structures, and simple cubic structures. The anions in simple ionic structures commonly adopt one of these structures,
and the cations occupy the spaces remaining between the anions. Small cations usually occupy tetrahedral holes in a
closest-packed array of anions. Larger cations usually occupy octahedral holes. Still larger cations can occupy cubic
holes in a simple cubic array of anions. The structure of a solid can be described by indicating the size and shape of a
unit cell and the contents of the cell. The type of structure and dimensions of the unit cell can be determined by X-ray
diffraction measurements.

Introduction
Coral reefs are home to about 25% of all marine species. They are being threatened by climate change, oceanic
acidification, and water pollution, all of which change the composition of the solution known as seawater. Dissolved
oxygen in seawater is critical for sea creatures, but as the oceans warm, oxygen becomes less soluble. As the
concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the oceans
increases, contributing to oceanic acidification. Coral reefs are particularly sensitive to the acidification of the ocean,
since the exoskeletons of the coral polyps are soluble in acidic solutions. Humans contribute to the changing of
seawater composition by allowing agricultural runoff and other forms of pollution to affect our oceans.
Solutions are crucial to the processes that sustain life and to many other processes involving chemical reactions. This
chapter considers the nature of solutions and examines factors that determine whether a solution will form and what
properties it may have. The properties of colloids—mixtures containing dispersed particles larger than the molecules
and ions of typical solutions—are also discussed.
Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 599
11.1 The Dissolution Process
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the basic properties of solutions and how they form
• Predict whether a given mixture will yield a solution based on molecular properties of its components
• Explain why some solutions either produce or absorb heat when they form
An earlier chapter of this text introduced solutions, defined as homogeneous mixtures of two or more substances.
Often, one component of a solution is present at a significantly greater concentration, in which case it is called the
solvent. The other components of the solution present in relatively lesser concentrations are called solutes. Sugar is
a covalent solid composed of sucrose molecules, C12H22O11. When this compound dissolves in water, its molecules
become uniformly distributed among the molecules of water:
C12 H22 O11(s) ⟶ C12 H22 O11(aq)
The subscript “aq” in the equation signifies that the sucrose molecules are solutes and are therefore individually
dispersed throughout the aqueous solution (water is the solvent). Although sucrose molecules are heavier than water
molecules, they remain dispersed throughout the solution; gravity does not cause them to “settle out” over time.
Potassium dichromate, K2Cr2O7, is an ionic compound composed of colorless potassium ions, K+, and orange
dichromate ions, Cr2 O7 2−. When a small amount of solid potassium dichromate is added to water, the compound
dissolves and dissociates to yield potassium ions and dichromate ions uniformly distributed throughout the mixture
(Figure 11.2), as indicated in this equation:
K2 Cr2 O7(s) ⟶ 2K+(aq) + Cr2 O7 2−(aq)
As with the mixture of sugar and water, this mixture is also an aqueous solution. Its solutes, potassium and dichromate
ions, remain individually dispersed among the solvent (water) molecules.
Figure 11.2 When potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) is mixed with water, it forms a homogeneous orange solution.

common covalent and ionic substances (sugar and salt) in water.
Water is used so often as a solvent that the word solution has come to imply an aqueous solution to many people.
However, almost any gas, liquid, or solid can act as a solvent. Many alloys are solid solutions of one metal
dissolved in another; for example, US five-cent coins contain nickel dissolved in copper. Air is a gaseous solution, a
homogeneous mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and several other gases. Oxygen (a gas), alcohol (a liquid), and sugar (a
solid) all dissolve in water (a liquid) to form liquid solutions. Table 11.1 gives examples of several different solutions
and the phases of the solutes and solvents.

Table 11.1
Solutions exhibit these defining traits:
• They are homogeneous; after a solution is mixed, it has the same composition at all points throughout (its
composition is uniform).
• The physical state of a solution—solid, liquid, or gas—is typically the same as that of the solvent, as
demonstrated by the examples in Table 11.1.
• The components of a solution are dispersed on a molecular scale; they consist of a mixture of separated solute
particles (molecules, atoms, and/or ions) each closely surrounded by solvent species.
• The dissolved solute in a solution will not settle out or separate from the solvent.
• The composition of a solution, or the concentrations of its components, can be varied continuously (within
limits determined by the solubility of the components, discussed in detail later in this chapter).
The Formation of Solutions
The formation of a solution is an example of a spontaneous process, a process that occurs under specified conditions
without the requirement of energy from some external source. Sometimes a mixture is stirred to speed up the
dissolution process, but this is not necessary; a homogeneous solution will form eventually. The topic of spontaneity is
critically important to the study of chemical thermodynamics and is treated more thoroughly in a later chapter of this
text. For purposes of this chapter’s discussion, it will suffice to consider two criteria that favor, but do not guarantee,
the spontaneous formation of a solution:
1. a decrease in the internal energy of the system (an exothermic change, as discussed in the previous chapter on
thermochemistry)
2. an increased dispersal of matter in the system (which indicates an increase in the entropy of the system, as you
will learn about in the later chapter on thermodynamics)
In the process of dissolution, an internal energy change often, but not always, occurs as heat is absorbed or evolved.
An increase in matter dispersal always results when a solution forms from the uniform distribution of solute molecules
throughout a solvent.
When the strengths of the intermolecular forces of attraction between solute and solvent species in a solution are no
different than those present in the separated components, the solution is formed with no accompanying energy change.
Such a solution is called an ideal solution. A mixture of ideal gases (or gases such as helium and argon, which closely
approach ideal behavior) is an example of an ideal solution, since the entities comprising these gases experience no
significant intermolecular attractions.
When containers of helium and argon are connected, the gases spontaneously mix due to diffusion and form a solution
1. If bubbles of gas are observed within the liquid, the mixture is not homogeneous and, thus, not a solution.
Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 601
(Figure 11.3). The formation of this solution clearly involves an increase in matter dispersal, since the helium and
argon atoms occupy a volume twice as large as that which each occupied before mixing.
Figure 11.3 Samples of helium and argon spontaneously mix to give a solution.
Ideal solutions may also form when structurally similar liquids are mixed. For example, mixtures of the alcohols
methanol (CH3OH) and ethanol (C2H5OH) form ideal solutions, as do mixtures of the hydrocarbons pentane, C5H12,
and hexane, C6H14. Placing methanol and ethanol, or pentane and hexane, in the bulbs shown in Figure 11.3 will
result in the same diffusion and subsequent mixing of these liquids as is observed for the He and Ar gases (although
at a much slower rate), yielding solutions with no significant change in energy. Unlike a mixture of gases, however,
the components of these liquid-liquid solutions do, indeed, experience intermolecular attractive forces. But since
the molecules of the two substances being mixed are structurally very similar, the intermolecular attractive forces
between like and unlike molecules are essentially the same, and the dissolution process, therefore, does not entail
any appreciable increase or decrease in energy. These examples illustrate how increased matter dispersal alone can
provide the driving force required to cause the spontaneous formation of a solution. In some cases, however, the
relative magnitudes of intermolecular forces of attraction between solute and solvent species may prevent dissolution.
Three types of intermolecular attractive forces are relevant to the dissolution process: solute-solute, solvent-solvent,
and solute-solvent. As illustrated in Figure 11.4, the formation of a solution may be viewed as a stepwise process
in which energy is consumed to overcome solute-solute and solvent-solvent attractions (endothermic processes) and
released when solute-solvent attractions are established (an exothermic process referred to as solvation). The relative
magnitudes of the energy changes associated with these stepwise processes determine whether the dissolution process
overall will release or absorb energy. In some cases, solutions do not form because the energy required to separate
solute and solvent species is so much greater than the energy released by solvation.
602 Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids

Figure 11.4 This schematic representation of dissolution shows a stepwise process involving the endothermic
separation of solute and solvent species (Steps 1 and 2) and exothermic solvation (Step 3).
Consider the example of an ionic compound dissolving in water. Formation of the solution requires the electrostatic
forces between the cations and anions of the compound (solute–solute) be overcome completely as attractive
forces are established between these ions and water molecules (solute–solvent). Hydrogen bonding between a
relatively small fraction of the water molecules must also be overcome to accommodate any dissolved solute. If the
solute’s electrostatic forces are significantly greater than the solvation forces, the dissolution process is significantly
endothermic and the compound may not dissolve to an appreciable extent. Calcium carbonate, the major component
of coral reefs, is one example of such an “insoluble” ionic compound (see Figure 11.1). On the other hand, if
the solvation forces are much stronger than the compound’s electrostatic forces, the dissolution is significantly
exothermic and the compound may be highly soluble. A common example of this type of ionic compound is sodium
chloride, commonly known as table salt.
As noted at the beginning of this module, spontaneous solution formation is favored, but not guaranteed, by
exothermic dissolution processes. While many soluble compounds do, indeed, dissolve with the release of heat,
some dissolve endothermically. Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) is one such example and is used to make instant cold
packs for treating injuries like the one pictured in Figure 11.5. A thin-walled plastic bag of water is sealed inside
a larger bag with solid NH4NO3. When the smaller bag is broken, a solution of NH4NO3 forms, absorbing heat
from the surroundings (the injured area to which the pack is applied) and providing a cold compress that decreases
swelling. Endothermic dissolutions such as this one require a greater energy input to separate the solute species than
is recovered when the solutes are solvated, but they are spontaneous nonetheless due to the increase in disorder that
accompanies formation of the solution.

endothermic process.
Watch this brief video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16endoexo) illustrating endothermic and
exothermic dissolution processes.
11.2 Electrolytes
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
• Define and give examples of electrolytes
• Distinguish between the physical and chemical changes that accompany dissolution of ionic and covalent
electrolytes
• Relate electrolyte strength to solute-solvent attractive forces
When some substances are dissolved in water, they undergo either a physical or a chemical change that yields ions
in solution. These substances constitute an important class of compounds called electrolytes. Substances that do not
yield ions when dissolved are called nonelectrolytes. If the physical or chemical process that generates the ions
is essentially 100% efficient (all of the dissolved compound yields ions), then the substance is known as a strong
electrolyte. If only a relatively small fraction of the dissolved substance undergoes the ion-producing process, it is
called a weak electrolyte.

Substances may be identified as strong, weak, or nonelectrolytes by measuring the electrical conductance of an
aqueous solution containing the substance. To conduct electricity, a substance must contain freely mobile, charged
species. Most familiar is the conduction of electricity through metallic wires, in which case the mobile, charged
entities are electrons. Solutions may also conduct electricity if they contain dissolved ions, with conductivity
increasing as ion concentration increases. Applying a voltage to electrodes immersed in a solution permits assessment
of the relative concentration of dissolved ions, either quantitatively, by measuring the electrical current flow, or
qualitatively, by observing the brightness of a light bulb included in the circuit (Figure 11.6).
Figure 11.6 Solutions of nonelectrolytes such as ethanol do not contain dissolved ions and cannot conduct
electricity. Solutions of electrolytes contain ions that permit the passage of electricity. The conductivity of an
electrolyte solution is related to the strength of the electrolyte.
Ionic Electrolytes
Water and other polar molecules are attracted to ions, as shown in Figure 11.7. The electrostatic attraction between
an ion and a molecule with a dipole is called an ion-dipole attraction. These attractions play an important role in the
dissolution of ionic compounds in water.
Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 605
Figure 11.7 As potassium chloride (KCl) dissolves in water, the ions are hydrated. The polar water molecules are
attracted by the charges on the K+ and Cl− ions. Water molecules in front of and behind the ions are not shown.
When ionic compounds dissolve in water, the ions in the solid separate and disperse uniformly throughout the solution
because water molecules surround and solvate the ions, reducing the strong electrostatic forces between them. This
process represents a physical change known as dissociation. Under most conditions, ionic compounds will dissociate
nearly completely when dissolved, and so they are classified as strong electrolytes. Even sparingly, soluble ionic
compounds are strong electrolytes, since the small amount that does dissolve will dissociate completely.
Consider what happens at the microscopic level when solid KCl is added to water. Ion-dipole forces attract the
positive (hydrogen) end of the polar water molecules to the negative chloride ions at the surface of the solid, and they
attract the negative (oxygen) ends to the positive potassium ions. The water molecules surround individual K+ and
Cl− ions, reducing the strong interionic forces that bind the ions together and letting them move off into solution as
solvated ions, as Figure 11.7 shows. Overcoming the electrostatic attraction permits the independent motion of each
hydrated ion in a dilute solution as the ions transition from fixed positions in the undissolved compound to widely
dispersed, solvated ions in solution.
Covalent Electrolytes
Pure water is an extremely poor conductor of electricity because it is only very slightly ionized—only about two out
of every 1 billion molecules ionize at 25 °C. Water ionizes when one molecule of water gives up a proton (H+ ion) to
another molecule of water, yielding hydronium and hydroxide ions.
H2 O(l) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + OH−(aq)
In some cases, solutions prepared from covalent compounds conduct electricity because the solute molecules react
chemically with the solvent to produce ions. For example, pure hydrogen chloride is a gas consisting of covalent HCl
606 Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
molecules. This gas contains no ions. However, an aqueous solution of HCl is a very good conductor, indicating that
an appreciable concentration of ions exists within the solution.
Because HCl is an acid, its molecules react with water, transferring H+ ions to form hydronium ions (H3O+) and
chloride ions (Cl−):
This reaction is essentially 100% complete for HCl (i.e., it is a strong acid and, consequently, a strong electrolyte).
Likewise, weak acids and bases that only react partially generate relatively low concentrations of ions when dissolved
in water and are classified as weak electrolytes. The reader may wish to review the discussion of strong and weak
acids provided in the earlier chapter of this text on reaction classes and stoichiometry.
11.3 Solubility
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
• Describe the effects of temperature and pressure on solubility
• State Henry’s law and use it in calculations involving the solubility of a gas in a liquid
• Explain the degrees of solubility possible for liquid-liquid solutions
Imagine adding a small amount of sugar to a glass of water, stirring until all the sugar has dissolved, and then adding
a bit more. You can repeat this process until the sugar concentration of the solution reaches its natural limit, a limit
determined primarily by the relative strengths of the solute-solute, solute-solvent, and solvent-solvent attractive forces
discussed in the previous two modules of this chapter. You can be certain that you have reached this limit because,
no matter how long you stir the solution, undissolved sugar remains. The concentration of sugar in the solution at this
point is known as its solubility.
The solubility of a solute in a particular solvent is the maximum concentration that may be achieved under given
conditions when the dissolution process is at equilibrium.
When a solute’s concentration is equal to its solubility, the solution is said to be saturated with that solute. If the
solute’s concentration is less than its solubility, the solution is said to be unsaturated. A solution that contains
a relatively low concentration of solute is called dilute, and one with a relatively high concentration is called
concentrated.
Use this interactive simulation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16Phetsoluble) to prepare various
saturated solutions.
Solutions may be prepared in which a solute concentration exceeds its solubility. Such solutions are said to be
supersaturated, and they are interesting examples of nonequilibrium states (a detailed treatment of this important
concept is provided in the text chapters on equilibrium). For example, the carbonated beverage in an open container
that has not yet “gone flat” is supersaturated with carbon dioxide gas; given time, the CO2 concentration will decrease
until it reaches its solubility.

Solutions of Gases in Liquids
As for any solution, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is affected by the intermolecular attractive forces between
solute and solvent species. Unlike solid and liquid solutes, however, there is no solute-solute intermolecular attraction
to overcome when a gaseous solute dissolves in a liquid solvent (see Figure 11.4) since the atoms or molecules
comprising a gas are far separated and experience negligible interactions. Consequently, solute-solvent interactions
are the sole energetic factor affecting solubility. For example, the water solubility of oxygen is approximately three
times greater than that of helium (there are greater dispersion forces between water and the larger oxygen molecules)
but 100 times less than the solubility of chloromethane, CHCl3 (polar chloromethane molecules experience
dipole–dipole attraction to polar water molecules). Likewise note the solubility of oxygen in hexane, C6H14, is
approximately 20 times greater than it is in water because greater dispersion forces exist between oxygen and the
larger hexane molecules.
Temperature is another factor affecting solubility, with gas solubility typically decreasing as temperature increases
(Figure 11.8). This inverse relation between temperature and dissolved gas concentration is responsible for one of
the major impacts of thermal pollution in natural waters.
Figure 11.8 The solubilities of these gases in water decrease as the temperature increases. All solubilities were
measured with a constant pressure of 101.3 kPa (1 atm) of gas above the solutions.
When the temperature of a river, lake, or stream is raised, the solubility of oxygen in the water is decreased. Decreased
levels of dissolved oxygen may have serious consequences for the health of the water’s ecosystems and, in severe
cases, can result in large-scale fish kills (Figure 11.9).

subjected to thermal pollution can result in large-scale fish kills. (credit a: modification of work by Liz West; credit b:
modification of work by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)
The solubility of a gaseous solute is also affected by the partial pressure of solute in the gas to which the solution is
exposed. Gas solubility increases as the pressure of the gas increases. Carbonated beverages provide a nice illustration
of this relationship. The carbonation process involves exposing the beverage to a relatively high pressure of carbon
dioxide gas and then sealing the beverage container, thus saturating the beverage with CO2 at this pressure. When
the beverage container is opened, a familiar hiss is heard as the carbon dioxide gas pressure is released, and some of
the dissolved carbon dioxide is typically seen leaving solution in the form of small bubbles (Figure 11.10). At this
point, the beverage is supersaturated with carbon dioxide and, with time, the dissolved carbon dioxide concentration
will decrease to its equilibrium value and the beverage will become “flat.”
Figure 11.10 Opening the bottle of carbonated beverage reduces the pressure of the gaseous carbon dioxide above
the beverage. The solubility of CO2 is thus lowered, and some dissolved carbon dioxide may be seen leaving the
solution as small gas bubbles. (credit: modification of work by Derrick Coetzee)
Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 609
For many gaseous solutes, the relation between solubility, Cg, and partial pressure, Pg, is a proportional one:
Cg = kPg
where k is a proportionality constant that depends on the identities of the gaseous solute and solvent, and on the
solution temperature. This is a mathematical statement of Henry’s law: The quantity of an ideal gas that dissolves in
a definite volume of liquid is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas.
Example 11.1
Application of Henry’s Law
At 20 °C, the concentration of dissolved oxygen in water exposed to gaseous oxygen at a partial pressure of
101.3 kPa is 1.38 × 10−3 mol L−1. Use Henry’s law to determine the solubility of oxygen when its partial
pressure is 20.7 kPa, the approximate pressure of oxygen in earth’s atmosphere.
Solution
According to Henry’s law, for an ideal solution the solubility, Cg, of a gas (1.38 × 10−3 mol L−1, in this
case) is directly proportional to the pressure, Pg, of the undissolved gas above the solution (101.3 kPa in this
case). Because both Cg and Pg are known, this relation can be rearragned and used to solve for k.
Cg = kPg
k = Cg
Pg
= 1.38 × 10−3 mol L−1
101.3 kPa
= 1.36 × 10−5 mol L−1 kPa−1
Now, use k to find the solubility at the lower pressure.
Cg = kPg
1.36 × 10−5 mol L−1 kPa−1 × 20.7 kPa
= 2.82 × 10−4 mol L−1
Note that various units may be used to express the quantities involved in these sorts of computations. Any
combination of units that yield to the constraints of dimensional analysis are acceptable.

this gaseous solute when its pressure is 760 torr.
Answer: 7.25 × 10−3 in 100.0 mL or 0.0725 g/L

Thermal Pollution and Oxygen Solubility
A certain species of freshwater trout requires a dissolved oxygen concentration of 7.5 mg/L. Could these
fish thrive in a thermally polluted mountain stream (water temperature is 30.0 °C, partial pressure of
atmospheric oxygen is 0.17 atm)?
Solution
First, compute the Henry’s law constant for oxygen in water at the specified temperature of 30.0 °C (see
610 Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Figure 11.19).
k = Cg
Pg = 1.15 × 10−3 mol/L/1.00 atm = 1.15 × 10−3 mol/L atm
Then, use this k value to compute the oxygen solubility at the specified oxygen partial pressure, 0.17 atm.
Cg = kPg = (1.15 × 10−3 mol/L atm) (0.17 atm) = 1.95 × 10−4 mol/L
Finally, convert this dissolved oxygen concentration from mol/L to mg/L.
(1.95 × 10−4 mol/L) (32.0 g/1 mol) (1000 mg/g) = 6.2 mg/L.
This concentration is lesser than the required minimum value of 7.5 mg/L, and so these trout would likely
not thrive in the polluted stream.

Decompression Sickness or “The Bends”
Decompression sickness (DCS), or “the bends,” is an effect of the increased pressure of the air inhaled
by scuba divers when swimming underwater at considerable depths. In addition to the pressure exerted by
the atmosphere, divers are subjected to additional pressure due to the water above them, experiencing an
increase of approximately 1 atm for each 10 m of depth. Therefore, the air inhaled by a diver while submerged
contains gases at the corresponding higher ambient pressure, and the concentrations of the gases dissolved
in the diver’s blood are proportionally higher per Henry’s law.
As the diver ascends to the surface of the water, the ambient pressure decreases and the dissolved gases
becomes less soluble. If the ascent is too rapid, the gases escaping from the diver’s blood may form bubbles
that can cause a variety of symptoms ranging from rashes and joint pain to paralysis and death. To avoid
DCS, divers must ascend from depths at relatively slow speeds (10 or 20 m/min) or otherwise make several
decompression stops, pausing for several minutes at given depths during the ascent. When these preventive
measures are unsuccessful, divers with DCS are often provided hyperbaric oxygen therapy in pressurized
vessels called decompression (or recompression) chambers (Figure 11.11).
Chemistry in Everyday Life

Figure 11.11 (a) US Navy divers undergo training in a recompression chamber. (b) Divers receive
hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
Deviations from Henry’s law are observed when a chemical reaction takes place between the gaseous solute and the
solvent. Thus, for example, the solubility of ammonia in water increases more rapidly with increasing pressure than
predicted by the law because ammonia, being a base, reacts to some extent with water to form ammonium ions and
hydroxide ions.
Gases can form supersaturated solutions. If a solution of a gas in a liquid is prepared either at low temperature or
under pressure (or both), then as the solution warms or as the gas pressure is reduced, the solution may become
supersaturated. In 1986, more than 1700 people in Cameroon were killed when a cloud of gas, almost certainly carbon
dioxide, bubbled from Lake Nyos (Figure 11.12), a deep lake in a volcanic crater. The water at the bottom of Lake
Nyos is saturated with carbon dioxide by volcanic activity beneath the lake. It is believed that the lake underwent a
turnover due to gradual heating from below the lake, and the warmer, less-dense water saturated with carbon dioxide
reached the surface. Consequently, tremendous quantities of dissolved CO2 were released, and the colorless gas,
which is denser than air, flowed down the valley below the lake and suffocated humans and animals living in the
valley.

Solutions of Liquids in Liquids
Some liquids may be mixed in any proportions to yield solutions; in other words, they have infinite mutual solubility
and are said to be miscible. Ethanol, sulfuric acid, and ethylene glycol (popular for use as antifreeze, pictured in
Figure 11.13) are examples of liquids that are completely miscible with water. Two-cycle motor oil is miscible with
gasoline, mixtures of which are used as lubricating fuels for various types of outdoor power equipment (chainsaws,
leaf blowers, and so on).
Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 613

Miscible liquids are typically those with very similar polarities. Consider, for example, liquids that are polar or
capable of hydrogen bonding. For such liquids, the dipole-dipole attractions (or hydrogen bonding) of the solute
molecules with the solvent molecules are at least as strong as those between molecules in the pure solute or in
the pure solvent. Hence, the two kinds of molecules mix easily. Likewise, nonpolar liquids are miscible with each
other because there is no appreciable difference in the strengths of solute-solute, solvent-solvent, and solute-solvent
intermolecular attractions. The solubility of polar molecules in polar solvents and of nonpolar molecules in nonpolar
solvents is, again, an illustration of the chemical axiom “like dissolves like.”
Two liquids that do not mix to an appreciable extent are called immiscible. Separate layers are formed when
immiscible liquids are poured into the same container. Gasoline, oil (Figure 11.14), benzene, carbon tetrachloride,
some paints, and many other nonpolar liquids are immiscible with water. Relatively weak attractive forces between
the polar water molecules and the nonpolar liquid molecules are not adequate to overcome much stronger hydrogen
bonding between water molecules. The distinction between immiscibility and miscibility is really one of extent, so
that miscible liquids are of infinite mutual solubility, while liquids said to be immiscible are of very low (though not
zero) mutual solubility.

Two liquids, such as bromine and water, that are of moderate mutual solubility are said to be partially miscible. Two
partially miscible liquids usually form two layers when mixed. In the case of the bromine and water mixture, the
upper layer is water, saturated with bromine, and the lower layer is bromine saturated with water. Since bromine is
nonpolar, and, thus, not very soluble in water, the water layer is only slightly discolored by the bright orange bromine
dissolved in it. Since the solubility of water in bromine is very low, there is no noticeable effect on the dark color of
the bromine layer (Figure 11.15).

Solutions of Solids in Liquids
The dependence of solubility on temperature for a number of solids in water is shown by the solubility curves in
Figure 11.16. Reviewing these data indicates a general trend of increasing solubility with temperature, although
there are exceptions, as illustrated by the ionic compound cerium sulfate.

Figure 11.16 This graph shows how the solubility of several solids changes with temperature.
The temperature dependence of solubility can be exploited to prepare supersaturated solutions of certain compounds.
A solution may be saturated with the compound at an elevated temperature (where the solute is more soluble) and
subsequently cooled to a lower temperature without precipitating the solute. The resultant solution contains solute
at a concentration greater than its equilibrium solubility at the lower temperature (i.e., it is supersaturated) and is
relatively stable. Precipitation of the excess solute can be initiated by adding a seed crystal (see the video in the Link
to Learning earlier in this module) or by mechanically agitating the solution. Some hand warmers, such as the one
pictured in Figure 11.17, take advantage of this behavior.

11.4 Colligative Properties
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Express concentrations of solution components using mole fraction and molality
• Describe the effect of solute concentration on various solution properties (vapor pressure, boiling point,
freezing point, and osmotic pressure)
• Perform calculations using the mathematical equations that describe these various colligative effects
• Describe the process of distillation and its practical applications
• Explain the process of osmosis and describe how it is applied industrially and in nature
The properties of a solution are different from those of either the pure solute(s) or solvent. Many solution properties
are dependent upon the chemical identity of the solute. Compared to pure water, a solution of hydrogen chloride is
more acidic, a solution of ammonia is more basic, a solution of sodium chloride is more dense, and a solution of
sucrose is more viscous. There are a few solution properties, however, that depend only upon the total concentration
of solute species, regardless of their identities. These colligative properties include vapor pressure lowering, boiling
point elevation, freezing point depression, and osmotic pressure. This small set of properties is of central importance
to many natural phenomena and technological applications, as will be described in this module.
Mole Fraction and Molality
Several units commonly used to express the concentrations of solution components were introduced in an earlier
chapter of this text, each providing certain benefits for use in different applications. For example, molarity (M) is
a convenient unit for use in stoichiometric calculations, since it is defined in terms of the molar amounts of solute
species:
M = mol solute
L solution
Because solution volumes vary with temperature, molar concentrations will likewise vary. When expressed as
molarity, the concentration of a solution with identical numbers of solute and solvent species will be different at
different temperatures, due to the contraction/expansion of the solution. More appropriate for calculations involving
many colligative properties are mole-based concentration units whose values are not dependent on temperature. Two
such units are mole fraction (introduced in the previous chapter on gases) and molality.
The mole fraction, X, of a component is the ratio of its molar amount to the total number of moles of all solution
components:
XA = mol A
total mol of all components
By this definition, the sum of mole fractions for all solution components (the solvent and all solutes) is equal to one.
Molality is a concentration unit defined as the ratio of the numbers of moles of solute to the mass of the solvent in
kilograms:

m = mol solute
kg solvent
Since these units are computed using only masses and molar amounts, they do not vary with temperature and,
thus, are better suited for applications requiring temperature-independent concentrations, including several colligative
properties, as will be described in this chapter module.
Example 11.3
Calculating Mole Fraction and Molality
The antifreeze in most automobile radiators is a mixture of equal volumes of ethylene glycol and water, with
minor amounts of other additives that prevent corrosion. What are the (a) mole fraction and (b) molality of
ethylene glycol, C2H4(OH)2, in a solution prepared from 2.22 × 103 g of ethylene glycol and 2.00 × 103 g
of water (approximately 2 L of glycol and 2 L of water)?
Solution
(a) The mole fraction of ethylene glycol may be computed by first deriving molar amounts of both solution
components and then substituting these amounts into the definition of mole fraction.
mol C2 H4(OH)2 = 2.22×103 g × 1 mol C2 H4(OH)2
62.07 g C2 H4(OH)2
= 35.8 mol C2 H4(OH)2
mol H2 O = 2.00×103 g × 1 mol H2 O
18.02 g H2 O = 111 mol H2 O
Xethylene glycol = 35.8 mol C2 H4(OH)2
(35.8 + 111) mol total = 0.244
Notice that mole fraction is a dimensionless property, being the ratio of properties with identical units
(moles).
(b) Derive moles of solute and mass of solvent (in kg).
First, use the given mass of ethylene glycol and its molar mass to find the moles of solute:
2.22×103 g C2 H4(OH)2
⎛
⎝
mol C2 H2(OH)2
62.07 g
⎞
⎠ = 35.8 mol C2 H4(OH)2
Then, convert the mass of the water from grams to kilograms:
2.00×103 g H2 O⎛
⎝ 1 kg
1000 g
⎞
⎠ = 2.00 kg H2 O
Finally, calculate molarity per its definition:
molality = mol solute

molality = 35.8 mol C2 H4(OH)2

Converting Mole Fraction and Molal Concentrations
Calculate the mole fraction of solute and solvent in a 3.0 m solution of sodium chloride.

Converting from one concentration unit to another is accomplished by first comparing the two unit

The provided molal concentration may be written as:
3.0 mol NaCl
1 kg H2 O
The numerator for this solution’s mole fraction is, therefore, 3.0 mol NaCl. The denominator may be
computed by deriving the molar amount of water corresponding to 1.0 kg
1.0 kg H2 O⎛
⎝ 1000 g
1 kg

⎠⎛
⎝

and then substituting these molar amounts into the definition for mole fraction.
XH2 O = mol H2 O
mol NaCl + mol H2 O
XH2 O = 55 mol H2 O
3.0 mol NaCl + 55 mol H2 O
XH2 O = 0.95

M = 0.556 mol glucose/1 L solution
Consider the definition of molality:
m = mol solute/kg solvent
The amount of glucose in 1-L of this solution is 0.556 mol, so the mass of water in this volume of solution
is needed.

First, compute the mass of 1.00 L of the solution:

⎠ ⎛
⎝1.04 g/mL⎞
⎠ ⎛
⎝1000 mL/1L⎞
⎠ ⎛
⎝1 kg/1000 g⎞
⎠ = 1.04 kg soln
This is the mass of both the water and its solute, glucose, and so the mass of glucose must be subtracted.
Compute the mass of glucose from its molar amount:
⎛
⎝0.556 mol glucose⎞
⎠ ⎛
⎝180.2 g/1 mol⎞
⎠ = 100.2 g or 0.1002 kg
Subtracting the mass of glucose yields the mass of water in the solution:
1.02 kg solution − 0.1002 kg glucose = 0.92 kg water
Finally, the molality of glucose in this solution is computed as:
m = 0.556 mol glucose/0.92 kg water = 0.60 m

Vapor Pressure Lowering
As described in the chapter on liquids and solids, the equilibrium vapor pressure of a liquid is the pressure exerted by
its gaseous phase when vaporization and condensation are occurring at equal rates:
liquid ⇌ gas
Dissolving a nonvolatile substance in a volatile liquid results in a lowering of the liquid’s vapor pressure. This
phenomenon can be rationalized by considering the effect of added solute molecules on the liquid's vaporization and
condensation processes. To vaporize, solvent molecules must be present at the surface of the solution. The presence of
solute decreases the surface area available to solvent molecules and thereby reduces the rate of solvent vaporization.
Since the rate of condensation is unaffected by the presence of solute, the net result is that the vaporization-
condensation equilibrium is achieved with fewer solvent molecules in the vapor phase (i.e., at a lower vapor pressure)
(Figure 11.18). While this interpretation is useful, it does not account for several important aspects of the colligative
nature of vapor pressure lowering. A more rigorous explanation involves the property of entropy, a topic of discussion
in a later text chapter on thermodynamics. For purposes of understanding the lowering of a liquid's vapor pressure,
it is adequate to note that the more dispersed nature of matter in a solution, compared to separate solvent and solute
phases, serves to effectively stabilize the solvent molecules and hinder their vaporization. A lower vapor pressure
results, and a correspondingly higher boiling point as described in the next section of this module.
Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 621
Figure 11.18 The presence of nonvolatile solutes lowers the vapor pressure of a solution by impeding the
evaporation of solvent molecules.
The relationship between the vapor pressures of solution components and the concentrations of those components is
described by Raoult’s law: The partial pressure exerted by any component of an ideal solution is equal to the vapor
pressure of the pure component multiplied by its mole fraction in the solution.
PA = XA PA*
where PA is the partial pressure exerted by component A in the solution, PA* is the vapor pressure of pure A, and XA
is the mole fraction of A in the solution.
Recalling that the total pressure of a gaseous mixture is equal to the sum of partial pressures for all its components
(Dalton’s law of partial pressures), the total vapor pressure exerted by a solution containing i components is
Psolution = ∑
i
Pi = ∑
i
Xi Pi*
A nonvolatile substance is one whose vapor pressure is negligible (P* ≈ 0), and so the vapor pressure above a solution
containing only nonvolatile solutes is due only to the solvent:

Calculation of a Vapor Pressure

ethanol, C2H5OH, at 40 °C. The vapor pressure of pure ethanol is 0.178 atm at 40 °C. Glycerin is essentially
nonvolatile at this temperature.
Solution
Since the solvent is the only volatile component of this solution, its vapor pressure may be computed per
Raoult’s law as:
Psolution = Xsolvent Psolvent*
First, calculate the molar amounts of each solution component using the provided mass data.
92.1 g C3 H5(OH)3 × 1 mol C3 H5(OH)3

184.4 g C2 H5 OH × 1 mol C2 H5 OH

Next, calculate the mole fraction of the solvent (ethanol) and use Raoult’s law to compute the solution’s
vapor pressure.
XC2 H5 OH = 4.000 mol
(1.00 mol + 4.000 mol) = 0.800

pressure of pure water at 25 °C is 23.7 torr, what is the vapor pressure of the solution assuming ideal
behavior?
Answer: 23.4 torr
Distillation of Solutions
Solutions whose components have significantly different vapor pressures may be separated by a selective vaporization
process known as distillation. Consider the simple case of a mixture of two volatile liquids, A and B, with A
being the more volatile liquid. Raoult’s law can be used to show that the vapor above the solution is enriched in
component A, that is, the mole fraction of A in the vapor is greater than the mole fraction of A in the liquid (see
end-of-chapter Exercise 65). By appropriately heating the mixture, component A may be vaporized, condensed, and
collected—effectively separating it from component B.
Distillation is widely applied in both laboratory and industrial settings, being used to refine petroleum, to isolate
fermentation products, and to purify water. A typical apparatus for laboratory-scale distillations is shown in Figure
11.19.

Oil refineries use large-scale fractional distillation to separate the components of crude oil. The crude oil is heated to
high temperatures at the base of a tall fractionating column, vaporizing many of the components that rise within the
column. As vaporized components reach adequately cool zones during their ascent, they condense and are collected.
The collected liquids are simpler mixtures of hydrocarbons and other petroleum compounds that are of appropriate
composition for various applications (e.g., diesel fuel, kerosene, gasoline), as depicted in Figure 11.20.

Boiling Point Elevation
As described in the chapter on liquids and solids, the boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its vapor
pressure is equal to ambient atmospheric pressure. Since the vapor pressure of a solution is lowered due to the
presence of nonvolatile solutes, it stands to reason that the solution’s boiling point will subsequently be increased.
Vapor pressure increases with temperature, and so a solution will require a higher temperature than will pure solvent
to achieve any given vapor pressure, including one equivalent to that of the surrounding atmosphere. The increase in
boiling point observed when nonvolatile solute is dissolved in a solvent, ΔTb, is called boiling point elevation and is
directly proportional to the molal concentration of solute species:
ΔTb = Kb m
where Kb is the boiling point elevation constant, or the ebullioscopic constant and m is the molal concentration
(molality) of all solute species.
Boiling point elevation constants are characteristic properties that depend on the identity of the solvent. Values of Kb
for several solvents are listed in Table 11.2.

The extent to which the vapor pressure of a solvent is lowered and the boiling point is elevated depends on the total
number of solute particles present in a given amount of solvent, not on the mass or size or chemical identities of the
particles. A 1 m aqueous solution of sucrose (342 g/mol) and a 1 m aqueous solution of ethylene glycol (62 g/mol)
will exhibit the same boiling point because each solution has one mole of solute particles (molecules) per kilogram of
solvent.

point depression and is directly proportional to the molal concentration of the solute

Colligative Properties and De-Icing
Sodium chloride and its group 2 analogs calcium and magnesium chloride are often used to de-ice roadways
and sidewalks, due to the fact that a solution of any one of these salts will have a freezing point lower than
0 °C, the freezing point of pure water. The group 2 metal salts are frequently mixed with the cheaper and more
readily available sodium chloride (“rock salt”) for use on roads, since they tend to be somewhat less corrosive
than the NaCl, and they provide a larger depression of the freezing point, since they dissociate to yield three
particles per formula unit, rather than two particles like the sodium chloride.
Because these ionic compounds tend to hasten the corrosion of metal, they would not be a wise choice to use
in antifreeze for the radiator in your car or to de-ice a plane prior to takeoff. For these applications, covalent
compounds, such as ethylene or propylene glycol, are often used. The glycols used in radiator fluid not only
lower the freezing point of the liquid, but they elevate the boiling point, making the fluid useful in both winter and
summer. Heated glycols are often sprayed onto the surface of airplanes prior to takeoff in inclement weather
in the winter to remove ice that has already formed and prevent the formation of more ice, which would be
particularly dangerous if formed on the control surfaces of the aircraft (Figure 11.22).

Phase Diagram for a Solution
The colligative effects on vapor pressure, boiling point, and freezing point described in the previous section are
conveniently summarized by comparing the phase diagrams for a pure liquid and a solution derived from that liquid
(Figure 11.23).
Figure 11.23 Phase diagrams for a pure solvent (solid curves) and a solution formed by dissolving nonvolatile solute
in the solvent (dashed curves).
The liquid-vapor curve for the solution is located beneath the corresponding curve for the solvent, depicting the vapor
pressure lowering, ΔP, that results from the dissolution of nonvolatile solute. Consequently, at any given pressure,
Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 629
the solution’s boiling point is observed at a higher temperature than that for the pure solvent, reflecting the boiling
point elevation, ΔTb, associated with the presence of nonvolatile solute. The solid-liquid curve for the solution is
displaced left of that for the pure solvent, representing the freezing point depression, ΔTf, that accompanies solution
formation. Finally, notice that the solid-gas curves for the solvent and its solution are identical. This is the case for
many solutions comprising liquid solvents and nonvolatile solutes. Just as for vaporization, when a solution of this
sort is frozen, it is actually just the solvent molecules that undergo the liquid-to-solid transition, forming pure solid
solvent that excludes solute species. The solid and gaseous phases, therefore, are composed of solvent only, and so
transitions between these phases are not subject to colligative effects.
Osmosis and Osmotic Pressure of Solutions
A number of natural and synthetic materials exhibit selective permeation, meaning that only molecules or ions of a
certain size, shape, polarity, charge, and so forth, are capable of passing through (permeating) the material. Biological
cell membranes provide elegant examples of selective permeation in nature, while dialysis tubing used to remove
metabolic wastes from blood is a more simplistic technological example. Regardless of how they may be fabricated,
these materials are generally referred to as semipermeable membranes.
Consider the apparatus illustrated in Figure 11.24, in which samples of pure solvent and a solution are separated
by a membrane that only solvent molecules may permeate. Solvent molecules will diffuse across the membrane in
both directions. Since the concentration of solvent is greater in the pure solvent than the solution, these molecules
will diffuse from the solvent side of the membrane to the solution side at a faster rate than they will in the reverse
direction. The result is a net transfer of solvent molecules from the pure solvent to the solution. Diffusion-driven
transfer of solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane is a process known as osmosis.
Figure 11.24 (a) A solution and pure solvent are initially separated by an osmotic membrane. (b) Net transfer of
solvent molecules to the solution occurs until its osmotic pressure yields equal rates of transfer in both directions.

When osmosis is carried out in an apparatus like that shown in Figure 11.24, the volume of the solution increases as
it becomes diluted by accumulation of solvent. This causes the level of the solution to rise, increasing its hydrostatic
pressure (due to the weight of the column of solution in the tube) and resulting in a faster transfer of solvent molecules
back to the pure solvent side. When the pressure reaches a value that yields a reverse solvent transfer rate equal to the
osmosis rate, bulk transfer of solvent ceases. This pressure is called the osmotic pressure (Π) of the solution. The
osmotic pressure of a dilute solution is related to its solute molarity, M, and absolute temperature, T, according to the
equation
Π = MRT
where R is the universal gas constant.

Calculation of Osmotic Pressure
Assuming ideal solution behavior, what is the osmotic pressure (atm) of a 0.30 M solution of glucose in
water that is used for intravenous infusion at body temperature, 37 °C?
Solution
Find the osmotic pressure, Π, using the formula Π = MRT, where T is on the Kelvin scale (310 K) and the
value of R is expressed in appropriate units (0.08206 L atm/mol K).
Π = MRT
= 0.03 mol/L × 0.08206 L atm/mol K × 310 K
= 7.6 atm

Answer: 5.3 atm
If a solution is placed in an apparatus like the one shown in Figure 11.25, applying pressure greater than the osmotic
pressure of the solution reverses the osmosis and pushes solvent molecules from the solution into the pure solvent.
This technique of reverse osmosis is used for large-scale desalination of seawater and on smaller scales to produce
high-purity tap water for drinking.
Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 631
Figure 11.25 Applying a pressure greater than the osmotic pressure of a solution will reverse osmosis. Solvent
molecules from the solution are pushed into the pure solvent.
Reverse Osmosis Water Purification
In the process of osmosis, diffusion serves to move water through a semipermeable membrane from a less
concentrated solution to a more concentrated solution. Osmotic pressure is the amount of pressure that
must be applied to the more concentrated solution to cause osmosis to stop. If greater pressure is applied,
the water will go from the more concentrated solution to a less concentrated (more pure) solution. This is
called reverse osmosis. Reverse osmosis (RO) is used to purify water in many applications, from desalination
plants in coastal cities, to water-purifying machines in grocery stores (Figure 11.26), and smaller reverse-
osmosis household units. With a hand-operated pump, small RO units can be used in third-world countries,
disaster areas, and in lifeboats. Our military forces have a variety of generator-operated RO units that can be
transported in vehicles to remote locations.

Examples of osmosis are evident in many biological systems because cells are surrounded by semipermeable
membranes. Carrots and celery that have become limp because they have lost water can be made crisp again by
placing them in water. Water moves into the carrot or celery cells by osmosis. A cucumber placed in a concentrated
salt solution loses water by osmosis and absorbs some salt to become a pickle. Osmosis can also affect animal cells.
Solute concentrations are particularly important when solutions are injected into the body. Solutes in body cell fluids
and blood serum give these solutions an osmotic pressure of approximately 7.7 atm. Solutions injected into the body
must have the same osmotic pressure as blood serum; that is, they should be isotonic with blood serum. If a less
concentrated solution, a hypotonic solution, is injected in sufficient quantity to dilute the blood serum, water from the
diluted serum passes into the blood cells by osmosis, causing the cells to expand and rupture. This process is called
hemolysis. When a more concentrated solution, a hypertonic solution, is injected, the cells lose water to the more
concentrated solution, shrivel, and possibly die in a process called crenation. These effects are illustrated in Figure
11.27.

Determination of Molar Masses
Osmotic pressure and changes in freezing point, boiling point, and vapor pressure are directly proportional to the
number of solute species present in a given amount of solution. Consequently, measuring one of these properties for
a solution prepared using a known mass of solute permits determination of the solute’s molar mass.

Solution
Solve this problem using the following steps.
Step 1. Determine the change in freezing point from the observed freezing point and the freezing

point of pure benzene (Table 11.2).
ΔTf = 5.5 °C − 2.32 °C = 3.2 °C
Step 2. Determine the molal concentration from Kf, the freezing point depression constant for
benzene (Table 11.2), and ΔTf.
ΔTf = Kf m
m = ΔTf
Kf

and the mass of solvent used to make the solution.
Moles of solute = 0.63 mol solute
1.00 kg solvent × 0.0550 kg solvent = 0.035 mol
Step 4. Determine the molar mass from the mass of the solute and the number of moles in that
mass.

Determination of a Molar Mass from Osmotic Pressure
A 0.500 L sample of an aqueous solution containing 10.0 g of hemoglobin has an osmotic pressure of 5.9

Solution
Here is one set of steps that can be used to solve the problem:
Step 1. Convert the osmotic pressure to atmospheres, then determine the molar concentration
from the osmotic pressure.
Π = 5.9 torr × 1 atm
760 torr = 7.8 × 10−3 atm
Π = MRT
M = Π
RT = 7.8 × 10−3 atm
(0.08206 L atm/mol K)(295 K) = 3.2 × 10−4 M
Step 2. Determine the number of moles of hemoglobin in the solution from the concentration and
the volume of the solution.
moles of hemoglobin = 3.2 × 10−4 mol
1 L solution × 0.500 L solution = 1.6 × 10−4 mol
Step 3. Determine the molar mass from the mass of hemoglobin and the number of moles in that
mass.

Colligative Properties of Electrolytes
As noted previously in this module, the colligative properties of a solution depend only on the number, not on
the identity, of solute species dissolved. The concentration terms in the equations for various colligative properties
(freezing point depression, boiling point elevation, osmotic pressure) pertain to all solute species present in the
solution. For the solutions considered thus far in this chapter, the solutes have been nonelectrolytes that dissolve
physically without dissociation or any other accompanying process. Each molecule that dissolves yields one dissolved
solute molecule. The dissolution of an electroyte, however, is not this simple, as illustrated by the two common
examples below:
dissociation NaCl(s) ⟶ Na+ (aq) + Cl− (aq)
ionization HCl(aq) + H2 O(l) ⟶ Cl− (aq) + H3 O+ (aq)
Considering the first of these examples, and assuming complete dissociation, a 1.0 m aqueous solution of NaCl
contains 2.0 mole of ions (1.0 mol Na+ and 1.0 mol Cl−) per each kilogram of water, and its freezing point depression
is expected to be
ΔTf = 2.0 mol ions/kg water × 1.86 °C kg water/mol ion = 3.7 °C.
When this solution is actually prepared and its freezing point depression measured, however, a value of 3.4 °C is
obtained. Similar discrepancies are observed for other ionic compounds, and the differences between the measured
and expected colligative property values typically become more significant as solute concentrations increase. These
observations suggest that the ions of sodium chloride (and other strong electrolytes) are not completely dissociated in
solution.
To account for this and avoid the errors accompanying the assumption of total dissociation, an experimentally
measured parameter named in honor of Nobel Prize-winning German chemist Jacobus Henricus van’t Hoff is used.
The van’t Hoff factor (i) is defined as the ratio of solute particles in solution to the number of formula units
dissolved:
i = moles of particles in solution
moles of formula units dissolved
Values for measured van’t Hoff factors for several solutes, along with predicted values assuming complete
dissociation, are shown in Table 11.3.

In 1923, the chemists Peter Debye and Erich Hückel proposed a theory to explain the apparent incomplete ionization
of strong electrolytes. They suggested that although interionic attraction in an aqueous solution is very greatly reduced
by solvation of the ions and the insulating action of the polar solvent, it is not completely nullified. The residual
attractions prevent the ions from behaving as totally independent particles (Figure 11.28). In some cases, a positive
and negative ion may actually touch, giving a solvated unit called an ion pair. Thus, the activity, or the effective
concentration, of any particular kind of ion is less than that indicated by the actual concentration. Ions become more
and more widely separated the more dilute the solution, and the residual interionic attractions become less and less.
Thus, in extremely dilute solutions, the effective concentrations of the ions (their activities) are essentially equal to
the actual concentrations. Note that the van’t Hoff factors for the electrolytes in Table 11.3 are for 0.05 m solutions,
at which concentration the value of i for NaCl is 1.9, as opposed to an ideal value of 2.
Figure 11.28 Dissociation of ionic compounds in water is not always complete due to the formation of ion pairs.
Example 11.13
The Freezing Point of a Solution of an Electrolyte
The concentration of ions in seawater is approximately the same as that in a solution containing 4.2 g of
NaCl dissolved in 125 g of water. Use this information and a predicted value for the van’t Hoff factor (Table
11.3) to determine the freezing temperature the solution (assume ideal solution behavior).

11.5 Colloids
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the composition and properties of colloidal dispersions
• List and explain several technological applications of colloids
As a child, you may have made suspensions such as mixtures of mud and water, flour and water, or a suspension
of solid pigments in water, known as tempera paint. These suspensions are heterogeneous mixtures composed of
relatively large particles that are visible (or that can be seen with a magnifying glass). They are cloudy, and the
suspended particles settle out after mixing. On the other hand, a solution is a homogeneous mixture in which no
settling occurs and in which the dissolved species are molecules or ions. Solutions exhibit completely different
behavior from suspensions. A solution may be colored, but it is transparent, the molecules or ions are invisible,
and they do not settle out on standing. Another class of mixtures called colloids (or colloidal dispersions) exhibit
properties intermediate between those of suspensions and solutions (Figure 11.29). The particles in a colloid are
larger than most simple molecules; however, colloidal particles are small enough that they do not settle out upon
standing.

In a colloid, such as milk, the particles are much larger but remain dispersed and do not settle. (c) A suspension,
such as mud, is a heterogeneous mixture of suspended particles that appears cloudy and in which the particles can
settle. (credit a photo: modification of work by Adam Wimsatt; credit b photo: modification of work by Melissa Wiese;

The particles in a colloid are large enough to scatter light, a phenomenon called the Tyndall effect. This can make
colloidal mixtures appear cloudy or opaque, such as the searchlight beams shown in Figure 11.30. Clouds are
colloidal mixtures. They are composed of water droplets that are much larger than molecules, but that are small
enough that they do not settle out.
Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 639

the air (fog, smoke, etc.). (credit: “Bahman”/Wikimedia Commons)
The term “colloid”—from the Greek words kolla, meaning “glue,” and eidos, meaning “like”—was first used in 1861
by Thomas Graham to classify mixtures such as starch in water and gelatin. Many colloidal particles are aggregates of
hundreds or thousands of molecules, but others (such as proteins and polymer molecules) consist of a single extremely
large molecule. The protein and synthetic polymer molecules that form colloids may have molecular masses ranging
from a few thousand to many million atomic mass units.
Analogous to the identification of solution components as “solute” and “solvent,” the components of a colloid are
likewise classified according to their relative amounts. The particulate component typically present in a relatively
minor amount is called the dispersed phase and the substance or solution throughout which the particulate is
dispersed is called the dispersion medium. Colloids may involve virtually any combination of physical states (gas in
liquid, liquid in solid, solid in gas, etc.), as illustrated by the examples of colloidal systems given in Table 11.4.

Preparation of Colloidal Systems
Colloids are prepared by producing particles of colloidal dimensions and distributing these particles throughout a
dispersion medium. Particles of colloidal size are formed by two methods:
1. Dispersion methods: breaking down larger particles. For example, paint pigments are produced by dispersing
large particles by grinding in special mills.
2. Condensation methods: growth from smaller units, such as molecules or ions. For example, clouds form when
water molecules condense and form very small droplets.
A few solid substances, when brought into contact with water, disperse spontaneously and form colloidal systems.
Gelatin, glue, starch, and dehydrated milk powder behave in this manner. The particles are already of colloidal size;
the water simply disperses them. Powdered milk particles of colloidal size are produced by dehydrating milk spray.
Some atomizers produce colloidal dispersions of a liquid in air.
An emulsion may be prepared by shaking together or blending two immiscible liquids. This breaks one liquid into
droplets of colloidal size, which then disperse throughout the other liquid. Oil spills in the ocean may be difficult to
clean up, partly because wave action can cause the oil and water to form an emulsion. In many emulsions, however,
the dispersed phase tends to coalesce, form large drops, and separate. Therefore, emulsions are usually stabilized by
an emulsifying agent, a substance that inhibits the coalescence of the dispersed liquid. For example, a little soap will
stabilize an emulsion of kerosene in water. Milk is an emulsion of butterfat in water, with the protein casein serving
as the emulsifying agent. Mayonnaise is an emulsion of oil in vinegar, with egg yolk components as the emulsifying
agents.
Condensation methods form colloidal particles by aggregation of molecules or ions. If the particles grow beyond the
colloidal size range, drops or precipitates form, and no colloidal system results. Clouds form when water molecules
aggregate and form colloid-sized particles. If these water particles coalesce to form adequately large water drops
of liquid water or crystals of solid water, they settle from the sky as rain, sleet, or snow. Many condensation
methods involve chemical reactions. A red colloidal suspension of iron(III) hydroxide may be prepared by mixing a
concentrated solution of iron(III) chloride with hot water:
Fe3+(aq) + 3Cl−(aq) + 6H2 O(l) ⟶ Fe(OH)3(s) + H3 O+(aq) + 3Cl−(aq).
A colloidal gold sol results from the reduction of a very dilute solution of gold(III) chloride by a reducing agent such
as formaldehyde, tin(II) chloride, or iron(II) sulfate:
Au3+ + 3e− ⟶ Au
Some gold sols prepared in 1857 are still intact (the particles have not coalesced and settled), illustrating the long-
term stability of many colloids.
Soaps and Detergents
Pioneers made soap by boiling fats with a strongly basic solution made by leaching potassium carbonate, K2CO3,
from wood ashes with hot water. Animal fats contain polyesters of fatty acids (long-chain carboxylic acids). When
animal fats are treated with a base like potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide, glycerol and salts of fatty acids
such as palmitic, oleic, and stearic acid are formed. The salts of fatty acids are called soaps. The sodium salt of stearic
acid, sodium stearate, has the formula C17H35CO2Na and contains an uncharged nonpolar hydrocarbon chain, the
Chapter 11 | Solutions and Colloids 641
C17H35— unit, and an ionic carboxylate group, the — CO2 − unit (Figure 11.31).
Figure 11.31 Soaps contain a nonpolar hydrocarbon end (blue) and an ionic end (red). The ionic end is a
carboxylate group. The length of the hydrocarbon end can vary from soap to soap.
Detergents (soap substitutes) also contain nonpolar hydrocarbon chains, such as C12H25—, and an ionic group, such
as a sulfate— OSO3 −, or a sulfonate— SO3 − (Figure 11.32). Soaps form insoluble calcium and magnesium
compounds in hard water; detergents form water-soluble products—a definite advantage for detergents.
Figure 11.32 Detergents contain a nonpolar hydrocarbon end (blue) and an ionic end (red). The ionic end can be
either a sulfate or a sulfonate. The length of the hydrocarbon end can vary from detergent to detergent.
The cleaning action of soaps and detergents can be explained in terms of the structures of the molecules involved.
The hydrocarbon (nonpolar) end of a soap or detergent molecule dissolves in, or is attracted to, nonpolar substances
such as oil, grease, or dirt particles. The ionic end is attracted by water (polar), illustrated in Figure 11.33. As a
result, the soap or detergent molecules become oriented at the interface between the dirt particles and the water so
they act as a kind of bridge between two different kinds of matter, nonpolar and polar. Molecules such as this are
termed amphiphilic since they have both a hydrophobic (“water-fearing”) part and a hydrophilic (“water-loving”)
part. As a consequence, dirt particles become suspended as colloidal particles and are readily washed away.
Figure 11.33 This diagrammatic cross section of an emulsified drop of oil in water shows how soap or detergent
acts as an emulsifier.

Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill
The blowout of the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig on April 20, 2010, in the Gulf of Mexico near Mississippi
began the largest marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry. In the 87 days following the blowout,
an estimated 4.9 million barrels (210 million gallons) of oil flowed from the ruptured well 5000 feet below the
water’s surface. The well was finally declared sealed on September 19, 2010.
Crude oil is immiscible with and less dense than water, so the spilled oil rose to the surface of the water.
Floating booms, skimmer ships, and controlled burns were used to remove oil from the water’s surface in an
attempt to protect beaches and wetlands along the Gulf coast. In addition to removal of the oil, attempts were
also made to lessen its environmental impact by rendering it “soluble” (in the loose sense of the term) and thus
allowing it to be diluted to hopefully less harmful levels by the vast volume of ocean water. This approach used
1.84 million gallons of the oil dispersant Corexit 9527, most of which was injected underwater at the site of the
leak, with small amounts being sprayed on top of the spill. Corexit 9527 contains 2-butoxyethanol (C6H14O2),
an amphiphilic molecule whose polar and nonpolar ends are useful for emulsifying oil into small droplets,
increasing the surface area of the oil and making it more available to marine bacteria for digestion (Figure
11.34). While this approach avoids many of the immediate hazards that bulk oil poses to marine and coastal
ecosystems, it introduces the possibility of long-term effects resulting from the introduction of the complex and
potential toxic components of petroleum into the ocean’s food chain. A number of organizations are involved in
monitoring the extended impact of this oil spill, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16gulfspill) for additional details).

Electrical Properties of Colloidal Particles
Dispersed colloidal particles are often electrically charged. A colloidal particle of iron(III) hydroxide, for example,
does not contain enough hydroxide ions to compensate exactly for the positive charges on the iron(III) ions. Thus,
each individual colloidal particle bears a positive charge, and the colloidal dispersion consists of charged colloidal
particles and some free hydroxide ions, which keep the dispersion electrically neutral. Most metal hydroxide colloids
have positive charges, whereas most metals and metal sulfides form negatively charged dispersions. All colloidal
particles in any one system have charges of the same sign. This helps keep them dispersed because particles
containing like charges repel each other.
The charged nature of some colloidal particles may be exploited to remove them from a variety of mixtures. For
example, the particles comprising smoke are often colloidally dispersed and electrically charged. Frederick Cottrell,
an American chemist, developed a process to remove these particles. The charged particles are attracted to highly
charged electrodes, where they are neutralized and deposited as dust (Figure 11.36). This is one of the important
Chemistry in Everyday Life

methods used to clean up the smoke from a variety of industrial processes. The process is also important in the
recovery of valuable products from the smoke and flue dust of smelters, furnaces, and kilns. There are also similar
electrostatic air filters designed for home use to improve indoor air quality.

Born in Oakland, CA, in 1877, Frederick Cottrell devoured textbooks as if they were novels and graduated
from high school at the age of 16. He then entered the University of California (UC), Berkeley, completing a
Bachelor’s degree in three years. He saved money from his $1200 annual salary as a chemistry teacher at
Oakland High School to fund his studies in chemistry in Berlin with Nobel prize winner Jacobus Henricus van’t
Hoff, and in Leipzig with Wilhelm Ostwald, another Nobel awardee. After earning his PhD in physical chemistry,
he returned to the United States to teach at UC Berkeley. He also consulted for the DuPont Company, where he
developed the electrostatic precipitator, a device designed to curb air pollution by removing colloidal particles
from air. Cottrell used the proceeds from his invention to fund a nonprofit research corporation to finance
scientific research.

Gels
Gelatin desserts, such as Jell-O, are a type of colloid (Figure 11.37). Gelatin sets on cooling because the hot aqueous
mixture of gelatin coagulates as it cools, yielding an extremely viscous body known as a gel. A gel is a colloidal
dispersion of a liquid phase throughout a solid phase. It appears that the fibers of the dispersing medium form a
complex three-dimensional network, the interstices being filled with the liquid medium or a dilute solution of the
dispersing medium.

Summary
11.1 The Dissolution Process
A solution forms when two or more substances combine physically to yield a mixture that is homogeneous at the
molecular level. The solvent is the most concentrated component and determines the physical state of the solution.
The solutes are the other components typically present at concentrations less than that of the solvent. Solutions may
form endothermically or exothermically, depending upon the relative magnitudes of solute and solvent intermolecular
attractive forces. Ideal solutions form with no appreciable change in energy.
11.2 Electrolytes
Substances that dissolve in water to yield ions are called electrolytes. Electrolytes may be covalent compounds
that chemically react with water to produce ions (for example, acids and bases), or they may be ionic compounds
that dissociate to yield their constituent cations and anions, when dissolved. Dissolution of an ionic compound is
facilitated by ion-dipole attractions between the ions of the compound and the polar water molecules. Soluble ionic
substances and strong acids ionize completely and are strong electrolytes, while weak acids and bases ionize to only
a small extent and are weak electrolytes. Nonelectrolytes are substances that do not produce ions when dissolved in
water.
11.3 Solubility
The extent to which one substance will dissolve in another is determined by several factors, including the types
and relative strengths of intermolecular attractive forces that may exist between the substances’ atoms, ions, or
molecules. This tendency to dissolve is quantified as a substance’s solubility, its maximum concentration in a solution
at equilibrium under specified conditions. A saturated solution contains solute at a concentration equal to its solubility.
A supersaturated solution is one in which a solute’s concentration exceeds its solubility—a nonequilibrium (unstable)
condition that will result in solute precipitation when the solution is appropriately perturbed. Miscible liquids are
soluble in all proportions, and immiscible liquids exhibit very low mutual solubility. Solubilities for gaseous solutes
decrease with increasing temperature, while those for most, but not all, solid solutes increase with temperature. The
concentration of a gaseous solute in a solution is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas to which the solution
is exposed, a relation known as Henry’s law.
11.4 Colligative Properties
Properties of a solution that depend only on the concentration of solute particles are called colligative properties. They
include changes in the vapor pressure, boiling point, and freezing point of the solvent in the solution. The magnitudes
of these properties depend only on the total concentration of solute particles in solution, not on the type of particles.
The total concentration of solute particles in a solution also determines its osmotic pressure. This is the pressure that
must be applied to the solution to prevent diffusion of molecules of pure solvent through a semipermeable membrane
into the solution. Ionic compounds may not completely dissociate in solution due to activity effects, in which case
observed colligative effects may be less than predicted.

11.5 Colloids
Colloids are mixtures in which one or more substances are dispersed as relatively large solid particles or liquid
droplets throughout a solid, liquid, or gaseous medium. The particles of a colloid remain dispersed and do not settle
due to gravity, and they are often electrically charged. Colloids are widespread in nature and are involved in many
technological applications.

Introduction
The lizard in the photograph is not simply enjoying the sunshine or working on its tan. The heat from the sun’s rays
is critical to the lizard’s survival. A warm lizard can move faster than a cold one because the chemical reactions that
allow its muscles to move occur more rapidly at higher temperatures. A cold lizard is a slower lizard and an easier
meal for predators.
From baking a cake to determining the useful lifespan of a bridge, rates of chemical reactions play important roles
in our understanding of processes that involve chemical changes. Two questions are typically posed when planning
to carry out a chemical reaction. The first is: “Will the reaction produce the desired products in useful quantities?”
The second question is: “How rapidly will the reaction occur?” A third question is often asked when investigating
reactions in greater detail: “What specific molecular-level processes take place as the reaction occurs?” Knowing the
answer to this question is of practical importance when the yield or rate of a reaction needs to be controlled.
The study of chemical kinetics concerns the second and third questions—that is, the rate at which a reaction yields
products and the molecular-scale means by which a reaction occurs. This chapter examines the factors that influence
the rates of chemical reactions, the mechanisms by which reactions proceed, and the quantitative techniques used to
Chapter 12 | Kinetics 657
describe the rates at which reactions occur.
12.1 Chemical Reaction Rates
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define chemical reaction rate
• Derive rate expressions from the balanced equation for a given chemical reaction
• Calculate reaction rates from experimental data
A rate is a measure of how some property varies with time. Speed is a familiar rate that expresses the distance traveled
by an object in a given amount of time. Wage is a rate that represents the amount of money earned by a person
working for a given amount of time. Likewise, the rate of a chemical reaction is a measure of how much reactant is
consumed, or how much product is produced, by the reaction in a given amount of time.
The rate of reaction is the change in the amount of a reactant or product per unit time. Reaction rates are therefore
determined by measuring the time dependence of some property that can be related to reactant or product amounts.
Rates of reactions that consume or produce gaseous substances, for example, are conveniently determined by
measuring changes in volume or pressure. For reactions involving one or more colored substances, rates may be
monitored via measurements of light absorption. For reactions involving aqueous electrolytes, rates may be measured
via changes in a solution’s conductivity.
For reactants and products in solution, their relative amounts (concentrations) are conveniently used for purposes of
expressing reaction rates. For example, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, in an aqueous solution changes
slowly over time as it decomposes according to the equation:
2H2 O2(aq) ⟶ 2H2 O(l) + O2(g)
The rate at which the hydrogen peroxide decomposes can be expressed in terms of the rate of change of its
concentration, as shown here:
rate of decomposition of H2 O2 = − change in concentration of reactant
time interval
= −
⎡
⎣H2 O2⎤
⎦t2 − ⎡
⎣H2 O2⎤
⎦t1
t2 − t1
= − Δ⎡
⎣H2 O2⎤
⎦
Δt
This mathematical representation of the change in species concentration over time is the rate expression for
the reaction. The brackets indicate molar concentrations, and the symbol delta (Δ) indicates “change in.” Thus,
[H2 O2]t1 represents the molar concentration of hydrogen peroxide at some time t1; likewise, [H2 O2]t2 represents
the molar concentration of hydrogen peroxide at a later time t2; and Δ[H2O2] represents the change in molar
concentration of hydrogen peroxide during the time interval Δt (that is, t2 − t1). Since the reactant concentration
decreases as the reaction proceeds, Δ[H2O2] is a negative quantity. Reaction rates are, by convention, positive
quantities, and so this negative change in concentration is multiplied by −1. Figure 12.2 provides an example of data
collected during the decomposition of H2O2.
658 Chapter 12 | Kinetics
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Figure 12.2 The rate of decomposition of H2O2 in an aqueous solution decreases as the concentration of H2O2
decreases.
To obtain the tabulated results for this decomposition, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide was measured every
6 hours over the course of a day at a constant temperature of 40 °C. Reaction rates were computed for each time
interval by dividing the change in concentration by the corresponding time increment, as shown here for the first
6-hour period:
−Δ[H2 O2]
Δt = −(0.500 mol/L − 1.000 mol/L)
(6.00 h − 0.00 h) = 0.0833 mol L−1 h−1
Notice that the reaction rates vary with time, decreasing as the reaction proceeds. Results for the last 6-hour period
yield a reaction rate of:
−Δ[H2 O2]
Δt = −(0.0625 mol/L − 0.125 mol/L)
(24.00 h − 18.00 h) = 0.010 mol L−1 h−1
This behavior indicates the reaction continually slows with time. Using the concentrations at the beginning and end
of a time period over which the reaction rate is changing results in the calculation of an average rate for the reaction
over this time interval. At any specific time, the rate at which a reaction is proceeding is known as its instantaneous
rate. The instantaneous rate of a reaction at “time zero,” when the reaction commences, is its initial rate. Consider
the analogy of a car slowing down as it approaches a stop sign. The vehicle’s initial rate—analogous to the beginning
of a chemical reaction—would be the speedometer reading at the moment the driver begins pressing the brakes (t0). A
few moments later, the instantaneous rate at a specific moment—call it t1—would be somewhat slower, as indicated
by the speedometer reading at that point in time. As time passes, the instantaneous rate will continue to fall until it
reaches zero, when the car (or reaction) stops. Unlike instantaneous speed, the car’s average speed is not indicated by
the speedometer; but it can be calculated as the ratio of the distance traveled to the time required to bring the vehicle
to a complete stop (Δt). Like the decelerating car, the average rate of a chemical reaction will fall somewhere between
its initial and final rates.
The instantaneous rate of a reaction may be determined one of two ways. If experimental conditions permit the
measurement of concentration changes over very short time intervals, then average rates computed as described
earlier provide reasonably good approximations of instantaneous rates. Alternatively, a graphical procedure may be
used that, in effect, yields the results that would be obtained if short time interval measurements were possible. In a
plot of the concentration of hydrogen peroxide against time, the instantaneous rate of decomposition of H2O2 at any
time t is given by the slope of a straight line that is tangent to the curve at that time (Figure 12.3). These tangent line
slopes may be evaluated using calculus, but the procedure for doing so is beyond the scope of this chapter.
Chapter 12 | Kinetics 659
Figure 12.3 This graph shows a plot of concentration versus time for a 1.000 M solution of H2O2. The rate at any
time is equal to the negative of the slope of a line tangent to the curve at that time. Tangents are shown at t = 0 h
(“initial rate”) and at t = 12 h (“instantaneous rate” at 12 h).
Reaction Rates in Analysis: Test Strips for Urinalysis
Physicians often use disposable test strips to measure the amounts of various substances in a patient’s
urine (Figure 12.4). These test strips contain various chemical reagents, embedded in small pads at various
locations along the strip, which undergo changes in color upon exposure to sufficient concentrations of specific
substances. The usage instructions for test strips often stress that proper read time is critical for optimal results.
This emphasis on read time suggests that kinetic aspects of the chemical reactions occurring on the test strip
are important considerations.
The test for urinary glucose relies on a two-step process represented by the chemical equations shown here:
C6 H12 O6 + O2 →⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯
catalyst C6 H10 O6 + H2 O2
2H2 O2 + 2I− →⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯
catalyst I2 + 2H2 O + O2
The first equation depicts the oxidation of glucose in the urine to yield glucolactone and hydrogen peroxide.
The hydrogen peroxide produced subsequently oxidizes colorless iodide ion to yield brown iodine, which may
be visually detected. Some strips include an additional substance that reacts with iodine to produce a more
distinct color change.
The two test reactions shown above are inherently very slow, but their rates are increased by special enzymes
embedded in the test strip pad. This is an example of catalysis, a topic discussed later in this chapter. A typical
glucose test strip for use with urine requires approximately 30 seconds for completion of the color-forming
reactions. Reading the result too soon might lead one to conclude that the glucose concentration of the urine
sample is lower than it actually is (a false-negative result). Waiting too long to assess the color change can
lead to a false positive due to the slower (not catalyzed) oxidation of iodide ion by other substances found in
urine.

Relative Rates of Reaction
The rate of a reaction may be expressed as the change in concentration of any reactant or product. For any given
reaction, these rate expressions are all related simply to one another according to the reaction stoichiometry. The rate
of the general reaction
aA ⟶ bB
can be expressed in terms of the decrease in the concentration of A or the increase in the concentration of B. These
two rate expressions are related by the stoichiometry of the reaction:
rate = − ⎛

the reaction represented by the following equation:
2NH3(g) ⟶ N2(g) + 3H2(g)
The relation between the reaction rates expressed in terms of nitrogen production and ammonia consumption, for
example, is:

Δt × 1 mol N2

This may be represented in an abbreviated format by omitting the units of the stoichiometric factor:

Δmol NH3
Δt = Δmol N2

Note that a negative sign has been included as a factor to account for the opposite signs of the two amount changes
(the reactant amount is decreasing while the product amount is increasing). For homogeneous reactions, both the
reactants and products are present in the same solution and thus occupy the same volume, so the molar amounts may
be replaced with molar concentrations:

Δ[NH3]
Δt = Δ[N2]

Similarly, the rate of formation of H2 is three times the rate of formation of N2 because three moles of H2 are produced
for each mole of N2 produced.

Figure 12.5 illustrates the change in concentrations over time for the decomposition of ammonia into nitrogen and
hydrogen at 1100 °C. Slopes of the tangent lines at t = 500 s show that the instantaneous rates derived from all
three species involved in the reaction are related by their stoichiometric factors. The rate of hydrogen production, for
example, is observed to be three times greater than that for nitrogen production:
2.91 × 10−6 M/s
9.70 × 10−7 M/s ≈ 3

12.2 Factors Affecting Reaction Rates
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the effects of chemical nature, physical state, temperature, concentration, and catalysis on reaction
rates
The rates at which reactants are consumed and products are formed during chemical reactions vary greatly. Five
factors typically affecting the rates of chemical reactions will be explored in this section: the chemical nature of
Chapter 12 | Kinetics 663
the reacting substances, the state of subdivision (one large lump versus many small particles) of the reactants, the
temperature of the reactants, the concentration of the reactants, and the presence of a catalyst.
The Chemical Nature of the Reacting Substances
The rate of a reaction depends on the nature of the participating substances. Reactions that appear similar may have
different rates under the same conditions, depending on the identity of the reactants. For example, when small pieces
of the metals iron and sodium are exposed to air, the sodium reacts completely with air overnight, whereas the iron
is barely affected. The active metals calcium and sodium both react with water to form hydrogen gas and a base. Yet
calcium reacts at a moderate rate, whereas sodium reacts so rapidly that the reaction is almost explosive.
The Physical States of the Reactants
A chemical reaction between two or more substances requires intimate contact between the reactants. When reactants
are in different physical states, or phases (solid, liquid, gaseous, dissolved), the reaction takes place only at the
interface between the phases. Consider the heterogeneous reaction between a solid phase and either a liquid or
gaseous phase. Compared with the reaction rate for large solid particles, the rate for smaller particles will be greater
because the surface area in contact with the other reactant phase is greater. For example, large pieces of iron react
more slowly with acids than they do with finely divided iron powder (Figure 12.6). Large pieces of wood smolder,
smaller pieces burn rapidly, and saw dust burns explosively.
Figure 12.6 (a) Iron powder reacts rapidly with dilute hydrochloric acid and produces bubbles of hydrogen gas:
2Fe(s) + 6HCl(aq) ⟶ 2FeCl3(aq) + 3H2(g). (b) An iron nail reacts more slowly because the surface area exposed
to the acid is much less.
Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16cesium) to see the reaction of cesium with water in
slow motion and a discussion of how the state of reactants and particle size affect reaction rates.
Temperature of the Reactants
Chemical reactions typically occur faster at higher temperatures. Food can spoil quickly when left on the kitchen
counter. However, the lower temperature inside of a refrigerator slows that process so that the same food remains
fresh for days. Gas burners, hot plates, and ovens are often used in the laboratory to increase the speed of reactions
that proceed slowly at ordinary temperatures. For many chemical processes, reaction rates are approximately doubled
when the temperature is raised by 10 °C.

Concentrations of the Reactants
The rates of many reactions depend on the concentrations of the reactants. Rates usually increase when the
concentration of one or more of the reactants increases. For example, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) deteriorates as a
result of its reaction with the pollutant sulfur dioxide. The rate of this reaction depends on the amount of sulfur dioxide
in the air (Figure 12.7). An acidic oxide, sulfur dioxide combines with water vapor in the air to produce sulfurous
acid in the following reaction:
SO2(g) + H2 O(g) ⟶ H2 SO3(aq)
Calcium carbonate reacts with sulfurous acid as follows:
CaCO3(s) + H2 SO3(aq) ⟶ CaSO3(aq) + CO2(g) + H2 O(l)
In a polluted atmosphere where the concentration of sulfur dioxide is high, calcium carbonate deteriorates more
rapidly than in less polluted air. Similarly, phosphorus burns much more rapidly in an atmosphere of pure oxygen
than in air, which is only about 20% oxygen.
Figure 12.7 Statues made from carbonate compounds such as limestone and marble typically weather slowly over
time due to the actions of water, and thermal expansion and contraction. However, pollutants like sulfur dioxide can
accelerate weathering. As the concentration of air pollutants increases, deterioration of limestone occurs more
rapidly. (credit: James P Fisher III)
Phosphorous burns rapidly in air, but it will burn even more rapidly if the concentration of oxygen is higher.
Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16phosphor) to see an example.
The Presence of a Catalyst
Relatively dilute aqueous solutions of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, are commonly used as topical antiseptics. Hydrogen
peroxide decomposes to yield water and oxygen gas according to the equation:
2H2 O2(l) ⟶ 2H2 O(l) + O2(g)
Under typical conditions, this decomposition occurs very slowly. When dilute H2O2(aq) is poured onto an open
wound, however, the reaction occurs rapidly and the solution foams because of the vigorous production of oxygen gas.
This dramatic difference is caused by the presence of substances within the wound’s exposed tissues that accelerate
the decomposition process. Substances that function to increase the rate of a reaction are called catalysts, a topic
treated in greater detail later in this chapter.

Chemical reactions occur when molecules collide with each other and undergo a chemical transformation.
Before physically performing a reaction in a laboratory, scientists can use molecular modeling simulations
to predict how the parameters discussed earlier will influence the rate of a reaction. Use the PhET
Reactions & Rates interactive (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16PHETreaction) to explore how
temperature, concentration, and the nature of the reactants affect reaction rates.
12.3 Rate Laws
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the form and function of a rate law
• Use rate laws to calculate reaction rates
• Use rate and concentration data to identify reaction orders and derive rate laws
As described in the previous module, the rate of a reaction is often affected by the concentrations of reactants.
Rate laws (sometimes called differential rate laws) or rate equations are mathematical expressions that describe the
relationship between the rate of a chemical reaction and the concentration of its reactants. As an example, consider
the reaction described by the chemical equation
aA + bB ⟶ products
where a and b are stoichiometric coefficients. The rate law for this reaction is written as:
rate = k[A]m[B]n
in which [A] and [B] represent the molar concentrations of reactants, and k is the rate constant, which is specific
for a particular reaction at a particular temperature. The exponents m and n are the reaction orders and are typically
positive integers, though they can be fractions, negative, or zero. The rate constant k and the reaction orders m
and n must be determined experimentally by observing how the rate of a reaction changes as the concentrations of
the reactants are changed. The rate constant k is independent of the reactant concentrations, but it does vary with
temperature.
The reaction orders in a rate law describe the mathematical dependence of the rate on reactant concentrations.
Referring to the generic rate law above, the reaction is m order with respect to A and n order with respect to B. For
example, if m = 1 and n = 2, the reaction is first order in A and second order in B. The overall reaction order is
simply the sum of orders for each reactant. For the example rate law here, the reaction is third order overall (1 + 2 =
3). A few specific examples are shown below to further illustrate this concept.
The rate law:
rate = k⎡
⎣H2 O2⎤
⎦
describes a reaction that is first order in hydrogen peroxide and first order overall. The rate law:
rate = k⎡
⎣C4 H6⎤
⎦2
describes a reaction that is second order in C4H6 and second order overall. The rate law:
Link to Learning
666 Chapter 12 | Kinetics
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
rate = k[H+][OH−]
describes a reaction that is first order in H+, first order in OH−, and second order overall.
Example 12.3
Writing Rate Laws from Reaction Orders
An experiment shows that the reaction of nitrogen dioxide with carbon monoxide:
NO2(g) + CO(g) ⟶ NO(g) + CO2(g)
is second order in NO2 and zero order in CO at 100 °C. What is the rate law for the reaction?
Solution
The reaction will have the form:
rate = k[NO2]m[CO]n
The reaction is second order in NO2; thus m = 2. The reaction is zero order in CO; thus n = 0. The rate law
is:
rate = k[NO2 ]2[CO]0 = k[NO2]2
Remember that a number raised to the zero power is equal to 1, thus [CO]0 = 1, which is why the
CO concentration term may be omitted from the rate law: the rate of reaction is solely dependent on
the concentration of NO2. A later chapter section on reaction mechanisms will explain how a reactant’s
concentration can have no effect on a reaction rate despite being involved in the reaction.

Chapter 12 | Kinetics 667
A common experimental approach to the determination of rate laws is the method of initial rates. This method
involves measuring reaction rates for multiple experimental trials carried out using different initial reactant
concentrations. Comparing the measured rates for these trials permits determination of the reaction orders and,
subsequently, the rate constant, which together are used to formulate a rate law. This approach is illustrated in the next
two example exercises.
Example 12.4
Determining a Rate Law from Initial Rates
Ozone in the upper atmosphere is depleted when it reacts with nitrogen oxides. The rates of the reactions
of nitrogen oxides with ozone are important factors in deciding how significant these reactions are in the
formation of the ozone hole over Antarctica (Figure 12.8). One such reaction is the combination of nitric
oxide, NO, with ozone, O3:

Solution
The rate law will have the form:
rate = k[NO]m⎡
⎣O3 ⎤
⎦n
Determine the values of m, n, and k from the experimental data using the following three-part process:
Step 1. Determine the value of m from the data in which [NO] varies and [O3] is constant. In the
last three experiments, [NO] varies while [O3] remains constant. When [NO] doubles from trial 3 to
4, the rate doubles, and when [NO] triples from trial 3 to 5, the rate also triples. Thus, the rate is also
directly proportional to [NO], and m in the rate law is equal to 1.
Step 2. Determine the value of n from data in which [O3] varies and [NO] is constant. In the first
three experiments, [NO] is constant and [O3] varies. The reaction rate changes in direct proportion
to the change in [O3]. When [O3] doubles from trial 1 to 2, the rate doubles; when [O3] triples from
trial 1 to 3, the rate increases also triples. Thus, the rate is directly proportional to [O3], and n is
equal to 1.The rate law is thus:

As in Example 12.4, approach this problem in a stepwise fashion, determining the values of m and n from
the experimental data and then using these values to determine the value of k. In this example, however, an
explicit algebraic approach (vs. the implicit approach of the previous example) will be used to determine
the values of m and n:
Step 1. Determine the value of m from the data in which [NO] varies and [Cl2] is constant. Write
the ratios with the subscripts x and y to indicate data from two different trials:
ratex
ratey = k[NO]x
m [Cl2 ]x
n
k[NO]y
m [Cl2 ]y
n
Using the third trial and the first trial, in which [Cl2] does not vary, gives:
rate 3
rate 1 = 0.00675
0.00300 = k(0.15)m(0.10)n
k(0.10)m(0.10)n
Canceling equivalent terms in the numerator and denominator leaves:
0.00675
0.00300 = (0.15)m
(0.10)m
which simplifies to:
2.25 = (1.5)m
Use logarithms to determine the value of the exponent m:
670 Chapter 12 | Kinetics
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
ln(2.25) = mln(1.5)
ln(2.25)
ln(1.5) = m
2 = m
Confirm the result
1.52 = 2.25
Step 2. Determine the value of n from data in which [Cl2] varies and [NO] is constant.
rate 2
rate 1 = 0.00450
0.00300 = k(0.10)m(0.15)n
k(0.10)m(0.10)n
Cancelation gives:
0.0045
0.0030 = (0.15)n
(0.10)n
which simplifies to:
1.5 = (1.5)n
Thus n must be 1, and the form of the rate law is:
rate = k[NO]m ⎡
⎣Cl2⎤
⎦n = k[NO]2 ⎡
⎣Cl2⎤
⎦
Step 3. Determine the numerical value of the rate constant k with appropriate units. The units
for the rate of a reaction are mol/L/s. The units for k are whatever is needed so that substituting into
the rate law expression affords the appropriate units for the rate. In this example, the concentration
units are mol3/L3. The units for k should be mol−2 L2/s so that the rate is in terms of mol/L/s.
To determine the value of k once the rate law expression has been solved, simply plug in values from
the first experimental trial and solve for k:

Reaction Order and Rate Constant Units
In some of our examples, the reaction orders in the rate law happen to be the same as the coefficients in the chemical
equation for the reaction. This is merely a coincidence and very often not the case.
Rate laws may exhibit fractional orders for some reactants, and negative reaction orders are sometimes observed when
an increase in the concentration of one reactant causes a decrease in reaction rate. A few examples illustrating these

It is important to note that rate laws are determined by experiment only and are not reliably predicted by reaction
stoichiometry.
The units for a rate constant will vary as appropriate to accommodate the overall order of the reaction. The unit of
the rate constant for the second-order reaction described in Example 12.4 was determined to be L mol−1 s−1. For
the third-order reaction described in Example 12.5, the unit for k was derived to be L2 mol−2 s−1. Dimensional
analysis requires the rate constant unit for a reaction whose overall order is x to be Lx − 1 mol1 − x s−1. Table 12.1
summarizes the rate constant units for common reaction orders.

Note that the units in this table were derived using specific units for concentration (mol/L) and time (s), though any
valid units for these two properties may be used.

12.4 Integrated Rate Laws
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the form and function of an integrated rate law
• Perform integrated rate law calculations for zero-, first-, and second-order reactions
• Define half-life and carry out related calculations
• Identify the order of a reaction from concentration/time data
The rate laws discussed thus far relate the rate and the concentrations of reactants. We can also determine a second
form of each rate law that relates the concentrations of reactants and time. These are called integrated rate laws.
We can use an integrated rate law to determine the amount of reactant or product present after a period of time or to
estimate the time required for a reaction to proceed to a certain extent. For example, an integrated rate law is used to
determine the length of time a radioactive material must be stored for its radioactivity to decay to a safe level.
Using calculus, the differential rate law for a chemical reaction can be integrated with respect to time to give an
equation that relates the amount of reactant or product present in a reaction mixture to the elapsed time of the reaction.
This process can either be very straightforward or very complex, depending on the complexity of the differential rate
law. For purposes of discussion, we will focus on the resulting integrated rate laws for first-, second-, and zero-order
reactions.
First-Order Reactions
Integration of the rate law for a simple first-order reaction (rate = k[A]) results in an equation describing how the
reactant concentration varies with time:
[A]t = [A]0 e−kt
where [A]t is the concentration of A at any time t, [A]0 is the initial concentration of A, and k is the first-order rate
constant.
For mathematical convenience, this equation may be rearranged to other formats, including direct and indirect
proportionalities:
ln⎛
⎝[A]t
[A]0
⎞
⎠ = kt or ln⎛
⎝
[A]0
[A]t
⎞
⎠ = −kt
and a format showing a linear dependence of concentration in time:
ln[A]t = ln[A]0 −kt
Example 12.6
The Integrated Rate Law for a First-Order Reaction
The rate constant for the first-order decomposition of cyclobutane, C4H8 at 500 °C is 9.2 × 10−3 s−1:
C4 H8 ⟶ 2C2 H4
How long will it take for 80.0% of a sample of C4H8 to decompose?
Solution
Since the relative change in reactant concentration is provided, a convenient format for the integrated rate
law is:
Chapter 12 | Kinetics 673
ln⎛
⎝[A]0
[A]t
⎞
⎠ = kt
The initial concentration of C4H8, [A]0, is not provided, but the provision that 80.0% of the sample has
decomposed is enough information to solve this problem. Let x be the initial concentration, in which case
the concentration after 80.0% decomposition is 20.0% of x or 0.200x. Rearranging the rate law to isolate t
and substituting the provided quantities yields:
t = ln [x]
[0.200x] × 1
k
= ln 5 × 1
9.2 × 10−3 s−1
= 1.609 × 1

Answer: 16.7 days
In the next example exercise, a linear format for the integrated rate law will be convenient:
ln[A]t = (−k)(t) + ln[A]0
y = mx + b
A plot of ln[A]t versus t for a first-order reaction is a straight line with a slope of −k and a y-intercept of ln[A]0. If a
set of rate data are plotted in this fashion but do not result in a straight line, the reaction is not first order in A.

Second-Order Reactions
The equations that relate the concentrations of reactants and the rate constant of second-order reactions can be
fairly complicated. To illustrate the point with minimal complexity, only the simplest second-order reactions will
be described here, namely, those whose rates depend on the concentration of just one reactant. For these types of
reactions, the differential rate law is written as:
rate = k[A]2
For these second-order reactions, the integrated rate law is:
1
[A]t
= kt + 1
[A]0
where the terms in the equation have their usual meanings as defined earlier.
Example 12.8
The Integrated Rate Law for a Second-Order Reaction
The reaction of butadiene gas (C4H6) to yield C8H12 gas is described by the equation:
2C4 H6(g) ⟶ C8 H12(g)
This “dimerization” reaction is second order with a rate constant equal to 5.76 × 10−2 L mol−1 min−1 under
certain conditions. If the initial concentration of butadiene is 0.200 M, what is the concentration after 10.0
min?
Solution
For a second-order reaction, the integrated rate law is written
1
[A]t
= kt + 1
[A]0
We know three variables in this equation: [A]0 = 0.200 mol/L, k = 5.76 × 10−2 L/mol/min, and t = 10.0
min. Therefore, we can solve for [A], the fourth variable:

trend in the second-order plot (right) indicates that the reaction follows second-order kinetics.
According to the second-order integrated rate law, the rate constant is equal to the slope of the 1

Zero-Order Reactions
For zero-order reactions, the differential rate law is:
rate = k
A zero-order reaction thus exhibits a constant reaction rate, regardless of the concentration of its reactant(s). This
may seem counterintuitive, since the reaction rate certainly can’t be finite when the reactant concentration is zero.
For purposes of this introductory text, it will suffice to note that zero-order kinetics are observed for some reactions
only under certain specific conditions. These same reactions exhibit different kinetic behaviors when the specific
conditions aren’t met, and for this reason the more prudent term pseudo-zero-order is sometimes used.
The integrated rate law for a zero-order reaction is a linear function:
[A]t = −kt + [A]0
y = mx + b
A plot of [A] versus t for a zero-order reaction is a straight line with a slope of −k and a y-intercept of [A]0. Figure
12.11 shows a plot of [NH3] versus t for the thermal decomposition of ammonia at the surface of two different
heated solids. The decomposition reaction exhibits first-order behavior at a quartz (SiO2) surface, as suggested by the
exponentially decaying plot of concentration versus time. On a tungsten surface, however, the plot is linear, indicating
zero-order kinetics.
Example 12.10
Graphical Determination of Zero-Order Rate Constant
Use the data plot in Figure 12.11 to graphically estimate the zero-order rate constant for ammonia
decomposition at a tungsten surface.
Solution
The integrated rate law for zero-order kinetics describes a linear plot of reactant concentration, [A]t, versus
time, t, with a slope equal to the negative of the rate constant, −k. Following the mathematical approach of
Chapter 12 | Kinetics 679
previous examples, the slope of the linear data plot (for decomposition on W) is estimated from the graph.
Using the ammonia concentrations at t = 0 and t = 1000 s:
k = −slope = − (0.0015 mol L−1 − 0.0028 mol L−1)
(1000 s − 0 s) = 1.3 × 10−6 mol L−1 s−1

concentration reach 0.0001 mol L−1?
Answer: 35 min
Figure 12.11 The decomposition of NH3 on a tungsten (W) surface is a zero-order reaction, whereas on a quartz
(SiO2) surface, the reaction is first order.
The Half-Life of a Reaction
The half-life of a reaction (t1/2) is the time required for one-half of a given amount of reactant to be consumed. In
each succeeding half-life, half of the remaining concentration of the reactant is consumed. Using the decomposition
of hydrogen peroxide (Figure 12.2) as an example, we find that during the first half-life (from 0.00 hours to 6.00
hours), the concentration of H2O2 decreases from 1.000 M to 0.500 M. During the second half-life (from 6.00 hours
to 12.00 hours), it decreases from 0.500 M to 0.250 M; during the third half-life, it decreases from 0.250 M to 0.125

M. The concentration of H2O2 decreases by half during each successive period of 6.00 hours. The decomposition of
hydrogen peroxide is a first-order reaction, and, as can be shown, the half-life of a first-order reaction is independent
of the concentration of the reactant. However, half-lives of reactions with other orders depend on the concentrations
of the reactants.
First-Order Reactions
An equation relating the half-life of a first-order reaction to its rate constant may be derived from the integrated rate
law as follows:
ln [A]0
[A]t
= kt
t = ln [A]0
[A]t
× 1
k
Invoking the definition of half-life, symbolized t1/2, requires that the concentration of A at this point is one-half its
initial concentration: t = t1/2, [A]t = 1
2[A]0.
Substituting these terms into the rearranged integrated rate law and simplifying yields the equation for half-life:
t1/2 = ln [A]0

2[A]0

This equation describes an expected inverse relation between the half-life of the reaction and its rate constant, k.
Faster reactions exhibit larger rate constants and correspondingly shorter half-lives. Slower reactions exhibit smaller
rate constants and longer half-lives.

For a second-order reaction, t1/2 is inversely proportional to the concentration of the reactant, and the half-life
increases as the reaction proceeds because the concentration of reactant decreases. Unlike with first-order reactions,
the rate constant of a second-order reaction cannot be calculated directly from the half-life unless the initial
concentration is known.
Zero-Order Reactions
As for other reaction orders, an equation for zero-order half-life may be derived from the integrated rate law:
[A] = −kt + [A]0
Restricting the time and concentrations to those defined by half-life: t = t1/2 and [A] = [A]0

the half-life of a zero-order reaction increases as the initial concentration increases.

12.5 Collision Theory
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Use the postulates of collision theory to explain the effects of physical state, temperature, and concentration
on reaction rates
• Define the concepts of activation energy and transition state
• Use the Arrhenius equation in calculations relating rate constants to temperature
We should not be surprised that atoms, molecules, or ions must collide before they can react with each other. Atoms
must be close together to form chemical bonds. This simple premise is the basis for a very powerful theory that
explains many observations regarding chemical kinetics, including factors affecting reaction rates.
Collision theory is based on the following postulates:
1. The rate of a reaction is proportional to the rate of reactant collisions:
reaction rate ∝ # collisions
time
2. The reacting species must collide in an orientation that allows contact between the atoms that will become
bonded together in the product.
3. The collision must occur with adequate energy to permit mutual penetration of the reacting species’ valence
shells so that the electrons can rearrange and form new bonds (and new chemical species).
We can see the importance of the two physical factors noted in postulates 2 and 3, the orientation and energy of
collisions, when we consider the reaction of carbon monoxide with oxygen:
2 CO(g) + O2(g) ⟶ 2 CO2(g)
Carbon monoxide is a pollutant produced by the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels. To reduce this pollutant,
automobiles have catalytic converters that use a catalyst to carry out this reaction. It is also a side reaction of the
combustion of gunpowder that results in muzzle flash for many firearms. If carbon monoxide and oxygen are present
in sufficient amounts, the reaction will occur at high temperature and pressure.
The first step in the gas-phase reaction between carbon monoxide and oxygen is a collision between the two
molecules:
CO(g) + O2(g) ⟶ CO2(g) + O(g)
Although there are many different possible orientations the two molecules can have relative to each other, consider
the two presented in Figure 12.13. In the first case, the oxygen side of the carbon monoxide molecule collides
with the oxygen molecule. In the second case, the carbon side of the carbon monoxide molecule collides with the
oxygen molecule. The second case is clearly more likely to result in the formation of carbon dioxide, which has a
central carbon atom bonded to two oxygen atoms (O = C = O). This is a rather simple example of how important
the orientation of the collision is in terms of creating the desired product of the reaction.
684 Chapter 12 | Kinetics
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Figure 12.13 Illustrated are two collisions that might take place between carbon monoxide and oxygen molecules.
The orientation of the colliding molecules partially determines whether a reaction between the two molecules will
occur.
If the collision does take place with the correct orientation, there is still no guarantee that the reaction will proceed to
form carbon dioxide. In addition to a proper orientation, the collision must also occur with sufficient energy to result
in product formation. When reactant species collide with both proper orientation and adequate energy, they combine
to form an unstable species called an activated complex or a transition state. These species are very short lived and
usually undetectable by most analytical instruments. In some cases, sophisticated spectral measurements have been
used to observe transition states.
Collision theory explains why most reaction rates increase as concentrations increase. With an increase in the
concentration of any reacting substance, the chances for collisions between molecules are increased because there are
more molecules per unit of volume. More collisions mean a faster reaction rate, assuming the energy of the collisions
is adequate.
Activation Energy and the Arrhenius Equation
The minimum energy necessary to form a product during a collision between reactants is called the activation energy
(Ea). How this energy compares to the kinetic energy provided by colliding reactant molecules is a primary factor
affecting the rate of a chemical reaction. If the activation energy is much larger than the average kinetic energy of the
molecules, the reaction will occur slowly since only a few fast-moving molecules will have enough energy to react. If
the activation energy is much smaller than the average kinetic energy of the molecules, a large fraction of molecules
will be adequately energetic and the reaction will proceed rapidly.
Figure 12.14 shows how the energy of a chemical system changes as it undergoes a reaction converting reactants to
products according to the equation
A + B ⟶ C + D
These reaction diagrams are widely used in chemical kinetics to illustrate various properties of the reaction of
interest. Viewing the diagram from left to right, the system initially comprises reactants only, A + B. Reactant
molecules with sufficient energy can collide to form a high-energy activated complex or transition state. The unstable
transition state can then subsequently decay to yield stable products, C + D. The diagram depicts the reaction's
activation energy, Ea, as the energy difference between the reactants and the transition state. Using a specific energy,
the enthalpy (see chapter on thermochemistry), the enthalpy change of the reaction, ΔH, is estimated as the energy
difference between the reactants and products. In this case, the reaction is exothermic (ΔH < 0) since it yields a
decrease in system enthalpy.
Chapter 12 | Kinetics 685
Figure 12.14 Reaction diagram for the exothermic reaction A + B ⟶ C + D.
The Arrhenius equation relates the activation energy and the rate constant, k, for many chemical reactions:
k = Ae−Ea /RT
In this equation, R is the ideal gas constant, which has a value 8.314 J/mol/K, T is temperature on the Kelvin scale, Ea
is the activation energy in joules per mole, e is the constant 2.7183, and A is a constant called the frequency factor,
which is related to the frequency of collisions and the orientation of the reacting molecules.
Postulates of collision theory are nicely accommodated by the Arrhenius equation. The frequency factor, A, reflects
how well the reaction conditions favor properly oriented collisions between reactant molecules. An increased
probability of effectively oriented collisions results in larger values for A and faster reaction rates.
The exponential term, e−Ea/RT, describes the effect of activation energy on reaction rate. According to kinetic
molecular theory (see chapter on gases), the temperature of matter is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its
constituent atoms or molecules. The distribution of energies among the molecules composing a sample of matter
at any given temperature is described by the plot shown in Figure 12.15(a). Two shaded areas under the curve
represent the numbers of molecules possessing adequate energy (RT) to overcome the activation barriers (Ea). A lower
activation energy results in a greater fraction of adequately energized molecules and a faster reaction.
The exponential term also describes the effect of temperature on reaction rate. A higher temperature represents a
correspondingly greater fraction of molecules possessing sufficient energy (RT) to overcome the activation barrier
(Ea), as shown in Figure 12.15(b). This yields a greater value for the rate constant and a correspondingly faster
reaction rate.

12.6 Reaction Mechanisms
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Distinguish net reactions from elementary reactions (steps)
• Identify the molecularity of elementary reactions
• Write a balanced chemical equation for a process given its reaction mechanism
• Derive the rate law consistent with a given reaction mechanism
Chemical reactions very often occur in a step-wise fashion, involving two or more distinct reactions taking place in
sequence. A balanced equation indicates what is reacting and what is produced, but it reveals no details about how
the reaction actually takes place. The reaction mechanism (or reaction path) provides details regarding the precise,
step-by-step process by which a reaction occurs.
The decomposition of ozone, for example, appears to follow a mechanism with two steps:
O3(g) ⟶ O2(g) + O
O + O3(g) ⟶ 2O2(g)
Each of the steps in a reaction mechanism is an elementary reaction. These elementary reactions occur precisely as
represented in the step equations, and they must sum to yield the balanced chemical equation representing the overall
reaction:
2O3(g) ⟶ 3O2(g)
Notice that the oxygen atom produced in the first step of this mechanism is consumed in the second step and therefore
does not appear as a product in the overall reaction. Species that are produced in one step and consumed in a
subsequent step are called intermediates.
While the overall reaction equation for the decomposition of ozone indicates that two molecules of ozone react to
give three molecules of oxygen, the mechanism of the reaction does not involve the direct collision and reaction
of two ozone molecules. Instead, one O3 decomposes to yield O2 and an oxygen atom, and a second O3 molecule
subsequently reacts with the oxygen atom to yield two additional O2 molecules.
Unlike balanced equations representing an overall reaction, the equations for elementary reactions are explicit
representations of the chemical change taking place. The reactant(s) in an elementary reaction’s equation undergo
only the bond-breaking and/or making events depicted to yield the product(s). For this reason, the rate law for an
elementary reaction may be derived directly from the balanced chemical equation describing the reaction. This is not
the case for typical chemical reactions, for which rate laws may be reliably determined only via experimentation.

Unimolecular Elementary Reactions
The molecularity of an elementary reaction is the number of reactant species (atoms, molecules, or ions). For
example, a unimolecular reaction involves the reaction of a single reactant species to produce one or more molecules
of product:
A ⟶ products
The rate law for a unimolecular reaction is first order:
rate = k[A]
A unimolecular reaction may be one of several elementary reactions in a complex mechanism. For example, the
reaction:
O3 ⟶ O2 + O
illustrates a unimolecular elementary reaction that occurs as one part of a two-step reaction mechanism as described
above. However, some unimolecular reactions may be the only step of a single-step reaction mechanism. (In other
words, an “overall” reaction may also be an elementary reaction in some cases.) For example, the gas-phase
decomposition of cyclobutane, C4H8, to ethylene, C2H4, is represented by the following chemical equation:
This equation represents the overall reaction observed, and it might also represent a legitimate unimolecular
elementary reaction. The rate law predicted from this equation, assuming it is an elementary reaction, turns out to be
the same as the rate law derived experimentally for the overall reaction, namely, one showing first-order behavior:
rate = − Δ[C4 H8]
Δt = k[C4 H8]
This agreement between observed and predicted rate laws is interpreted to mean that the proposed unimolecular,
single-step process is a reasonable mechanism for the butadiene reaction.
Bimolecular Elementary Reactions
A bimolecular reaction involves two reactant species, for example:
A + B ⟶ products
and
2A ⟶ products
For the first type, in which the two reactant molecules are different, the rate law is first-order in A and first order in B
(second-order overall):
rate = k[A][B]
For the second type, in which two identical molecules collide and react, the rate law is second order in A:
rate = k[A][A] = k[A]2
Some chemical reactions occur by mechanisms that consist of a single bimolecular elementary reaction. One example
is the reaction of nitrogen dioxide with carbon monoxide:
NO2(g) + CO(g) ⟶ NO(g) + CO2(g)
(see Figure 12.17)
Chapter 12 | Kinetics 691
Figure 12.17 The probable mechanism for the reaction between NO2 and CO to yield NO and CO2.
Bimolecular elementary reactions may also be involved as steps in a multistep reaction mechanism. The reaction of
atomic oxygen with ozone is the second step of the two-step ozone decomposition mechanism discussed earlier in
this section:
O(g) + O3(g) ⟶ 2O2(g)
Termolecular Elementary Reactions
An elementary termolecular reaction involves the simultaneous collision of three atoms, molecules, or ions.
Termolecular elementary reactions are uncommon because the probability of three particles colliding simultaneously
is less than one one-thousandth of the probability of two particles colliding. There are, however, a few established
termolecular elementary reactions. The reaction of nitric oxide with oxygen appears to involve termolecular steps:
2NO + O2 ⟶ 2NO2
rate = k[NO]2[O2]
Likewise, the reaction of nitric oxide with chlorine appears to involve termolecular steps:
2NO + Cl2 ⟶ 2NOCl
rate = k[NO]2[Cl2]
Relating Reaction Mechanisms to Rate Laws
It’s often the case that one step in a multistep reaction mechanism is significantly slower than the others. Because a
reaction cannot proceed faster than its slowest step, this step will limit the rate at which the overall reaction occurs.
The slowest step is therefore called the rate-limiting step (or rate-determining step) of the reaction Figure 12.18.
Figure 12.18 A cattle chute is a nonchemical example of a rate-determining step. Cattle can only be moved from
one holding pen to another as quickly as one animal can make its way through the chute. (credit: Loren Kerns)

As described earlier, rate laws may be derived directly from the chemical equations for elementary reactions. This is
not the case, however, for ordinary chemical reactions. The balanced equations most often encountered represent the
overall change for some chemical system, and very often this is the result of some multistep reaction mechanisms.
In every case, the rate law must be determined from experimental data and the reaction mechanism subsequently
deduced from the rate law (and sometimes from other data). The reaction of NO2 and CO provides an illustrative
example:
NO2(g) + CO(g) ⟶ CO2(g) + NO(g)
For temperatures above 225 °C, the rate law has been found to be:
rate = k⎡
⎣NO2⎤
⎦[CO]
The reaction is first order with respect to NO2 and first-order with respect to CO. This is consistent with a single-step
bimolecular mechanism and it is possible that this is the mechanism for this reaction at high temperatures.
At temperatures below 225 °C, the reaction is described by a rate law that is second order with respect to NO2:
rate = k⎡
⎣NO2⎤
⎦2
This rate law is not consistent with the single-step mechanism, but is consistent with the following two-step
mechanism:
NO2(g) + NO2(g) ⟶ NO3(g) + NO(g) (slow)
NO3(g) + CO(g) ⟶ NO2(g) + CO2(g) (fast)
The rate-determining (slower) step gives a rate law showing second-order dependence on the NO2 concentration, and
the sum of the two equations gives the net overall reaction.
In general, when the rate-determining (slower) step is the first step in a mechanism, the rate law for the overall
reaction is the same as the rate law for this step. However, when the rate-determining step is preceded by a step
involving a rapidly reversible reaction the rate law for the overall reaction may be more difficult to derive.
As discussed in several chapters of this text, a reversible reaction is at equilibrium when the rates of the forward
and reverse processes are equal. Consider the reversible elementary reaction in which NO dimerizes to yield an
intermediate species N2O2. When this reaction is at equilibrium:
NO + NO ⇌ N2 O2
rateforward = ratereverse
k1[NO]2 = k−1 ⎡
⎣N2 O2⎤
⎦
This expression may be rearranged to express the concentration of the intermediate in terms of the reactant NO:
⎛
⎝
⎜k1[NO]2
k−1
⎞
⎠
⎟ = ⎡
⎣N2 O2⎤
⎦
Since intermediate species concentrations are not used in formulating rate laws for overall reactions, this approach is
sometimes necessary, as illustrated in the following example exercise.
Example 12.14
Deriving a Rate Law from a Reaction Mechanism
The two-step mechanism below has been proposed for a reaction between nitrogen monoxide and molecular
chlorine:
Chapter 12 | Kinetics 693
Step 1: NO(g) + Cl2(g) = NOCl2(g) fast
Step 2: NOCl2(g) + NO(g) ⟶ 2NOCl(g) slow
Use this mechanism to derive the equation and predicted rate law for the overall reaction.
Solution
The equation for the overall reaction is obtained by adding the two elementary reactions:
2NO(g) + Cl2(g) 2NOCl(g)
To derive a rate law from this mechanism, first write rates laws for each of the two steps.
rate1 = k1[NO][Cl2] for the forward reaction of step 1
rate−1 = k−1[NOCl2] for the reverse reaction of step 1
rate2 = k2[NOCl2][NO] for step 2
Step 2 is the rate-determining step, and so the rate law for the overall reaction should be the same as for this
step. However, the step 2 rate law, as written, contains an intermediate species concentration, [NOCl2]. To
remedy this, use the first step’s rate laws to derive an expression for the intermediate concentration in terms
of the reactant concentrations.
Assuming step 1 is at equilibrium:
rate1 = rate−1
k1 [NO][Cl2] = k−1 [NOCl2]
[NOCl2] = ⎛
⎝
k1
k−1

12.7 Catalysis
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the function of a catalyst in terms of reaction mechanisms and potential energy diagrams
• List examples of catalysis in natural and industrial processes
Among the factors affecting chemical reaction rates discussed earlier in this chapter was the presence of a catalyst, a
substance that can increase the reaction rate without being consumed in the reaction. The concepts introduced in the
previous section on reaction mechanisms provide the basis for understanding how catalysts are able to accomplish
this very important function.
Figure 12.19 shows reaction diagrams for a chemical process in the absence and presence of a catalyst. Inspection
of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent
694 Chapter 12 | Kinetics

the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more
energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different.
The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed
reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy.
This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an
alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a
reaction needn’t necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a
reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower Ea).
Figure 12.19 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve)
of a catalyst. The catalyzed pathway involves a two-step mechanism (note the presence of two transition states) and
an intermediate species (represented by the valley between the two transitions states).

Reaction diagrams for a chemical process with and without a catalyst are shown below. Both reactions
involve a two-step mechanism with a rate-determining first step. Compute activation energies for the first
step of each mechanism, and identify which corresponds to the catalyzed reaction. How do the second steps
of these two mechanisms compare?
Answer: For the first step, Ea = 80 kJ for (a) and 70 kJ for (b), so diagram (b) depicts the catalyzed reaction.
Activation energies for the second steps of both mechanisms are the same, 20 kJ.
Homogeneous Catalysts
A homogeneous catalyst is present in the same phase as the reactants. It interacts with a reactant to form an
intermediate substance, which then decomposes or reacts with another reactant in one or more steps to regenerate the
original catalyst and form product.
As an important illustration of homogeneous catalysis, consider the earth’s ozone layer. Ozone in the upper
atmosphere, which protects the earth from ultraviolet radiation, is formed when oxygen molecules absorb ultraviolet
light and undergo the reaction:
3O2(g) →⎯⎯⎯⎯
hv 2O3(g)
Ozone is a relatively unstable molecule that decomposes to yield diatomic oxygen by the reverse of this equation.
This decomposition reaction is consistent with the following two-step mechanism:
O3 ⟶ O2 + O
O + O3 ⟶ 2O2
A number of substances can catalyze the decomposition of ozone. For example, the nitric oxide–catalyzed
decomposition of ozone is believed to occur via the following three-step mechanism:
NO(g) + O3(g) ⟶ NO2(g) + O2(g)
O3(g) ⟶ O2(g) + O(g)
NO2(g) + O(g) ⟶ NO(g) + O2(g)
As required, the overall reaction is the same for both the two-step uncatalyzed mechanism and the three-step NO-
catalyzed mechanism:
2O3(g) ⟶ 3O2(g)
Notice that NO is a reactant in the first step of the mechanism and a product in the last step. This is another

characteristic trait of a catalyst: Though it participates in the chemical reaction, it is not consumed by the reaction.
Mario J. Molina
The 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was shared by Paul J. Crutzen, Mario J. Molina (Figure 12.20), and
F. Sherwood Rowland “for their work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly concerning the formation and
decomposition of ozone.”[1] Molina, a Mexican citizen, carried out the majority of his work at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT).
Figure 12.20 (a) Mexican chemist Mario Molina (1943 –) shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1995 for his
research on (b) the Antarctic ozone hole. (credit a: courtesy of Mario Molina; credit b: modification of work by
NASA)
In 1974, Molina and Rowland published a paper in the journal Nature detailing the threat of chlorofluorocarbon
gases to the stability of the ozone layer in earth’s upper atmosphere. The ozone layer protects earth from
solar radiation by absorbing ultraviolet light. As chemical reactions deplete the amount of ozone in the upper
atmosphere, a measurable “hole” forms above Antarctica, and an increase in the amount of solar ultraviolet
radiation— strongly linked to the prevalence of skin cancers—reaches earth’s surface. The work of Molina and
Rowland was instrumental in the adoption of the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty signed in 1987 that
successfully began phasing out production of chemicals linked to ozone destruction.
Molina and Rowland demonstrated that chlorine atoms from human-made chemicals can catalyze ozone
destruction in a process similar to that by which NO accelerates the depletion of ozone. Chlorine atoms are
generated when chlorocarbons or chlorofluorocarbons—once widely used as refrigerants and propellants—are
photochemically decomposed by ultraviolet light or react with hydroxyl radicals. A sample mechanism is shown
here using methyl chloride:
CH3 Cl + OH ⟶ Cl + other products
Chlorine radicals break down ozone and are regenerated by the following catalytic cycle:
Cl + O3 ⟶ ClO + O2
ClO + O ⟶ Cl + O2
overall Reaction: O3 + O ⟶ 2O2
A single monatomic chlorine can break down thousands of ozone molecules. Luckily, the majority of

atmospheric chlorine exists as the catalytically inactive forms Cl2 and ClONO2.
Since receiving his portion of the Nobel Prize, Molina has continued his work in atmospheric chemistry at MIT.
Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency
Enzymes in the human body act as catalysts for important chemical reactions in cellular metabolism. As such,
a deficiency of a particular enzyme can translate to a life-threatening disease. G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase) deficiency, a genetic condition that results in a shortage of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase, is the most common enzyme deficiency in humans. This enzyme, shown in Figure 12.21, is
the rate-limiting enzyme for the metabolic pathway that supplies NADPH to cells (Figure 12.22).
Figure 12.21 Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is a rate-limiting enzyme for the metabolic pathway that
supplies NADPH to cells.
A disruption in this pathway can lead to reduced glutathione in red blood cells; once all glutathione is
consumed, enzymes and other proteins such as hemoglobin are susceptible to damage. For example,
hemoglobin can be metabolized to bilirubin, which leads to jaundice, a condition that can become severe.
People who suffer from G6PD deficiency must avoid certain foods and medicines containing chemicals that
can trigger damage their glutathione-deficient red blood cells.

Heterogeneous Catalysts
A heterogeneous catalyst is a catalyst that is present in a different phase (usually a solid) than the reactants. Such
catalysts generally function by furnishing an active surface upon which a reaction can occur. Gas and liquid phase
reactions catalyzed by heterogeneous catalysts occur on the surface of the catalyst rather than within the gas or liquid
phase.
Heterogeneous catalysis typically involves the following processes:
1. Adsorption of the reactant(s) onto the surface of the catalyst
2. Activation of the adsorbed reactant(s)
3. Reaction of the adsorbed reactant(s)
4. Desorption of product(s) from the surface of the catalyst
Figure 12.23 illustrates the steps of a mechanism for the reaction of compounds containing a carbon–carbon double
bond with hydrogen on a nickel catalyst. Nickel is the catalyst used in the hydrogenation of polyunsaturated fats
and oils (which contain several carbon–carbon double bonds) to produce saturated fats and oils (which contain only
carbon–carbon single bonds).

Many important chemical products are prepared via industrial processes that use heterogeneous catalysts, including
ammonia, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, and methanol. Heterogeneous catalysts are also used in the catalytic converters
found on most gasoline-powered automobiles (Figure 12.24).
Automobile Catalytic Converters
Scientists developed catalytic converters to reduce the amount of toxic emissions produced by burning
gasoline in internal combustion engines. By utilizing a carefully selected blend of catalytically active metals,
it is possible to effect complete combustion of all carbon-containing compounds to carbon dioxide while also
reducing the output of nitrogen oxides. This is particularly impressive when we consider that one step involves
adding more oxygen to the molecule and the other involves removing the oxygen (Figure 12.24).

Figure 12.24 A catalytic converter allows for the combustion of all carbon-containing compounds to carbon
dioxide, while at the same time reducing the output of nitrogen oxide and other pollutants in emissions from
gasoline-burning engines.
Most modern, three-way catalytic converters possess a surface impregnated with a platinum-rhodium catalyst,
which catalyzes the conversion of nitric oxide into dinitrogen and oxygen as well as the conversion of carbon
monoxide and hydrocarbons such as octane into carbon dioxide and water vapor:
2NO2(g) ⟶ N2(g) + 2O2(g)
2CO(g) + O2(g) ⟶ 2CO2(g)
2C8 H18(g) + 25O2(g) ⟶ 16CO2(g) + 18H2 O(g)
In order to be as efficient as possible, most catalytic converters are preheated by an electric heater. This
ensures that the metals in the catalyst are fully active even before the automobile exhaust is hot enough to
maintain appropriate reaction temperatures.
The University of California at Davis’ “ChemWiki” provides a thorough explanation
(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16catconvert) of how catalytic converters work.
Enzyme Structure and Function
The study of enzymes is an important interconnection between biology and chemistry. Enzymes are usually
proteins (polypeptides) that help to control the rate of chemical reactions between biologically important
compounds, particularly those that are involved in cellular metabolism. Different classes of enzymes perform a
variety of functions, as shown in Table 12.3.

Enzyme molecules possess an active site, a part of the molecule with a shape that allows it to bond to a
specific substrate (a reactant molecule), forming an enzyme-substrate complex as a reaction intermediate.
There are two models that attempt to explain how this active site works. The most simplistic model is referred
to as the lock-and-key hypothesis, which suggests that the molecular shapes of the active site and substrate
are complementary, fitting together like a key in a lock. The induced fit hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests
that the enzyme molecule is flexible and changes shape to accommodate a bond with the substrate. This is
not to suggest that an enzyme’s active site is completely malleable, however. Both the lock-and-key model and
the induced fit model account for the fact that enzymes can only bind with specific substrates, since in general
a particular enzyme only catalyzes a particular reaction (Figure 12.25).
Figure 12.25 (a) According to the lock-and-key model, the shape of an enzyme’s active site is a perfect fit
for the substrate. (b) According to the induced fit model, the active site is somewhat flexible, and can change
shape in order to bond with the substrate.

Summary
12.1 Chemical Reaction Rates
The rate of a reaction can be expressed either in terms of the decrease in the amount of a reactant or the increase in
the amount of a product per unit time. Relations between different rate expressions for a given reaction are derived
directly from the stoichiometric coefficients of the equation representing the reaction.
12.2 Factors Affecting Reaction Rates
The rate of a chemical reaction is affected by several parameters. Reactions involving two phases proceed more
rapidly when there is greater surface area contact. If temperature or reactant concentration is increased, the rate of a
given reaction generally increases as well. A catalyst can increase the rate of a reaction by providing an alternative
pathway with a lower activation energy.
12.3 Rate Laws
Rate laws (differential rate laws) provide a mathematical description of how changes in the concentration of a
substance affect the rate of a chemical reaction. Rate laws are determined experimentally and cannot be predicted by
reaction stoichiometry. The order of reaction describes how much a change in the concentration of each substance
704 Chapter 12 | Kinetics

affects the overall rate, and the overall order of a reaction is the sum of the orders for each substance present in the
reaction. Reaction orders are typically first order, second order, or zero order, but fractional and even negative orders
are possible.
12.4 Integrated Rate Laws
Integrated rate laws are mathematically derived from differential rate laws, and they describe the time dependence of
reactant and product concentrations.
The half-life of a reaction is the time required to decrease the amount of a given reactant by one-half. A reaction’s
half-life varies with rate constant and, for some reaction orders, reactant concentration. The half-life of a zero-order
reaction decreases as the initial concentration of the reactant in the reaction decreases. The half-life of a first-order
reaction is independent of concentration, and the half-life of a second-order reaction decreases as the concentration
increases.
12.5 Collision Theory
Chemical reactions typically require collisions between reactant species. These reactant collisions must be of proper
orientation and sufficient energy in order to result in product formation. Collision theory provides a simple but
effective explanation for the effect of many experimental parameters on reaction rates. The Arrhenius equation
describes the relation between a reaction’s rate constant, activation energy, temperature, and dependence on collision
orientation.
12.6 Reaction Mechanisms
The sequence of individual steps, or elementary reactions, by which reactants are converted into products during
the course of a reaction is called the reaction mechanism. The molecularity of an elementary reaction is the
number of reactant species involved, typically one (unimolecular), two (bimolecular), or, less commonly, three
(termolecular). The overall rate of a reaction is determined by the rate of the slowest in its mechanism, called the
rate-determining step. Unimolecular elementary reactions have first-order rate laws, while bimolecular elementary
reactions have second-order rate laws. By comparing the rate laws derived from a reaction mechanism to that
determined experimentally, the mechanism may be deemed either incorrect or plausible.
12.7 Catalysis
Catalysts affect the rate of a chemical reaction by altering its mechanism to provide a lower activation energy.
Catalysts can be homogenous (in the same phase as the reactants) or heterogeneous (a different phase than the
reactants).

catalyzes a number of reactions, and its relative concentration can be determined by measuring the rate of one of
these reactions under controlled conditions. One such reaction is the conversion of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP)

Introduction
Imagine a beach populated with sunbathers and swimmers. As those basking in the sun get too hot, they enter the
surf to swim and cool off. As the swimmers tire, they return to the beach to rest. If the rate at which sunbathers enter
the surf were to equal the rate at which swimmers return to the sand, then the numbers (though not the identities)
of sunbathers and swimmers would remain constant. This scenario illustrates a dynamic phenomenon known as
equilibrium, in which opposing processes occur at equal rates. Chemical and physical processes are subject to this
phenomenon; these processes are at equilibrium when the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal. Equilibrium
systems are pervasive in nature; the various reactions involving carbon dioxide dissolved in blood are examples (see
Figure 13.1). This chapter provides a thorough introduction to the essential aspects of chemical equilibria.
Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts 721
13.1 Chemical Equilibria
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the nature of equilibrium systems
• Explain the dynamic nature of a chemical equilibrium
The convention for writing chemical equations involves placing reactant formulas on the left side of a reaction
arrow and product formulas on the right side. By this convention, and the definitions of “reactant” and “product,” a
chemical equation represents the reaction in question as proceeding from left to right. Reversible reactions, however,
may proceed in both forward (left to right) and reverse (right to left) directions. When the rates of the forward and
reverse reactions are equal, the concentrations of the reactant and product species remain constant over time and the
system is at equilibrium. The relative concentrations of reactants and products in equilibrium systems vary greatly;
some systems contain mostly products at equilibrium, some contain mostly reactants, and some contain appreciable
amounts of both.
Figure 13.2 illustrates fundamental equilibrium concepts using the reversible decomposition of colorless dinitrogen
tetroxide to yield brown nitrogen dioxide, an elementary reaction described by the equation:
N2 O4(g) ⇌ 2NO2(g)
Note that a special double arrow is used to emphasize the reversible nature of the reaction.

Figure 13.2 (a) A sealed tube containing colorless N2O4 darkens as it decomposes to yield brown NO2. (b) Changes
in concentration over time as the decomposition reaction achieves equilibrium. (c) At equilibrium, the forward and
reverse reaction rates are equal.
For this elementary process, rate laws for the forward and reverse reactions may be derived directly from the reaction
stoichiometry:
rate f = k f [N−2 O4]
rater = kr[NO2 ]2
As the reaction begins (t = 0), the concentration of the N2O4 reactant is finite and that of the NO2 product is zero,
so the forward reaction proceeds at a finite rate while the reverse reaction rate is zero. As time passes, N−2O4 is
consumed and its concentration falls, while NO2 is produced and its concentration increases (Figure 13.2b). The
decreasing concentration of the reactant slows the forward reaction rate, and the increasing product concentration
speeds the reverse reaction rate (Figure 13.2c). This process continues until the forward and reverse reaction rates
Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts 723
become equal, at which time the reaction has reached equilibrium, as characterized by constant concentrations of its
reactants and products (shaded areas of Figure 13.2b and Figure 13.2c). It’s important to emphasize that chemical
equilibria are dynamic; a reaction at equilibrium has not “stopped,” but is proceeding in the forward and reverse
directions at the same rate. This dynamic nature is essential to understanding equilibrium behavior as discussed in
this and subsequent chapters of the text.
Figure 13.3 A two-person juggling act illustrates the dynamic aspect of chemical equilibria. Each person is throwing
and catching clubs at the same rate, and each holds a (approximately) constant number of clubs.
Physical changes, such as phase transitions, are also reversible and may establish equilibria. This concept was
introduced in another chapter of this text through discussion of the vapor pressure of a condensed phase (liquid or
solid). As one example, consider the vaporization of bromine:
Br2(l) ⇌ Br2(g)
When liquid bromine is added to an otherwise empty container and the container is sealed, the forward process
depicted above (vaporization) will commence and continue at a roughly constant rate as long as the exposed surface
area of the liquid and its temperature remain constant. As increasing amounts of gaseous bromine are produced, the
rate of the reverse process (condensation) will increase until it equals the rate of vaporization and equilibrium is
established. A photograph showing this phase transition equilibrium is provided in Figure 13.4.

13.2 Equilibrium Constants
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Derive reaction quotients from chemical equations representing homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions
• Calculate values of reaction quotients and equilibrium constants, using concentrations and pressures
• Relate the magnitude of an equilibrium constant to properties of the chemical system
The status of a reversible reaction is conveniently assessed by evaluating its reaction quotient (Q). For a reversible
reaction described by
mA + nB + ⇌ xC + yD
the reaction quotient is derived directly from the stoichiometry of the balanced equation as
Qc = [C]x[D]y
[A]m[B]n
where the subscript c denotes the use of molar concentrations in the expression. If the reactants and products are
gaseous, a reaction quotient may be similarly derived using partial pressures:
Q p = PC
x PD
y
PA
m PB
n
Note that the reaction quotient equations above are a simplification of more rigorous expressions that use relative
values for concentrations and pressures rather than absolute values. These relative concentration and pressure values
are dimensionless (they have no units); consequently, so are the reaction quotients. For purposes of this introductory
text, it will suffice to use the simplified equations and to disregard units when computing Q. In most cases, this will
Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts 725
introduce only modest errors in calculations involving reaction quotients.

Figure 13.5 Changes in concentrations and Qc for a chemical equilibrium achieved beginning with (a) a mixture of
reactants only and (b) products only.
The numerical value of Q varies as a reaction proceeds towards equilibrium; therefore, it can serve as a useful
indicator of the reaction’s status. To illustrate this point, consider the oxidation of sulfur dioxide:
2SO2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2SO3(g)
Two different experimental scenarios are depicted in Figure 13.5, one in which this reaction is initiated with a
mixture of reactants only, SO2 and O2, and another that begins with only product, SO3. For the reaction that begins
with a mixture of reactants only, Q is initially equal to zero:
Qc = [SO3 ]2
[SO2 ]2 [O2] = 02
[SO2 ]2 [O2] = 0
As the reaction proceeds toward equilibrium in the forward direction, reactant concentrations decrease (as does
the denominator of Qc), product concentration increases (as does the numerator of Qc), and the reaction quotient
consequently increases. When equilibrium is achieved, the concentrations of reactants and product remain constant,
as does the value of Qc.
If the reaction begins with only product present, the value of Qc is initially undefined (immeasurably large, or
Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts 727
infinite):
Qc = [SO3 ]2
[SO2 ]2 [O2] = [SO3 ]2
0 → ∞
In this case, the reaction proceeds toward equilibrium in the reverse direction. The product concentration and the
numerator of Qc decrease with time, the reactant concentrations and the denominator of Qc increase, and the reaction
quotient consequently decreases until it becomes constant at equilibrium.
The constant value of Q exhibited by a system at equilibrium is called the equilibrium constant, K:
K ≡ Q at equilibrium
Comparison of the data plots in Figure 13.5 shows that both experimental scenarios resulted in the same value for
the equilibrium constant. This is a general observation for all equilibrium systems, known as the law of mass action:
At a given temperature, the reaction quotient for a system at equilibrium is constant.
Example 13.2
Evaluating a Reaction Quotient
Gaseous nitrogen dioxide forms dinitrogen tetroxide according to this equation:
2NO2(g) ⇌ N2 O4(g)
When 0.10 mol NO2 is added to a 1.0-L flask at 25 °C, the concentration changes so that at equilibrium,
[NO2] = 0.016 M and [N2O4] = 0.042 M.
(a) What is the value of the reaction quotient before any reaction occurs?
(b) What is the value of the equilibrium constant for the reaction?
Solution
As for all equilibrium calculations in this text, use the simplified equations for Q and K and disregard any
concentration or pressure units, as noted previously in this section.
(a) Before any product is formed, [NO2] = 0.10 mol
1.0 L = 0.10 M, and [N2O4] = 0 M. Thus,
Qc =
⎡
⎣N2 O4⎤
⎦
⎡
⎣NO2⎤
⎦2 = 0
0.102 = 0
(b) At equilibrium, Kc = Qc =
⎡
⎣N2 O4⎤
⎦
⎡
⎣NO2⎤
⎦2 = 0.042
0.0162 = 1.6 × 102. The equilibrium constant is 1.6 × 102.

For the reaction 2SO2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2SO3(g), the concentrations at equilibrium are [SO2] = 0.90 M, [O2]
= 0.35 M, and [SO3] = 1.1 M. What is the value of the equilibrium constant, Kc?
Answer: Kc = 4.3
By its definition, the magnitude of an equilibrium constant explicitly reflects the composition of a reaction mixture
at equilibrium, and it may be interpreted with regard to the extent of the forward reaction. A reaction exhibiting a
large K will reach equilibrium when most of the reactant has been converted to product, whereas a small K indicates
the reaction achieves equilibrium after very little reactant has been converted. It’s important to keep in mind that the
magnitude of K does not indicate how rapidly or slowly equilibrium will be reached. Some equilibria are established
so quickly as to be nearly instantaneous, and others so slowly that no perceptible change is observed over the course
of days, years, or longer.
The equilibrium constant for a reaction can be used to predict the behavior of mixtures containing its reactants and/or
728 Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
products. As demonstrated by the sulfur dioxide oxidation process described above, a chemical reaction will proceed
in whatever direction is necessary to achieve equilibrium. Comparing Q to K for an equilibrium system of interest
allows prediction of what reaction (forward or reverse), if any, will occur.
To further illustrate this important point, consider the reversible reaction shown below:
CO(g) + H2 O(g) ⇌ CO2(g) + H2(g) Kc = 0.640 T = 800 °C
The bar charts in Figure 13.6 represent changes in reactant and product concentrations for three different reaction
mixtures. The reaction quotients for mixtures 1 and 3 are initially lesser than the reaction’s equilibrium constant,
so each of these mixtures will experience a net forward reaction to achieve equilibrium. The reaction quotient for
mixture 2 is initially greater than the equilibrium constant, so this mixture will proceed in the reverse direction until
equilibrium is established.

Homogeneous Equilibria
A homogeneous equilibrium is one in which all reactants and products (and any catalysts, if applicable) are present
in the same phase. By this definition, homogeneous equilibria take place in solutions. These solutions are most
commonly either liquid or gaseous phases, as shown by the examples below:
C2 H2(aq) + 2Br2(aq) ⇌ C2 H2 Br4(aq) Kc =
⎡
⎣C2 H2 Br4⎤

[I2][I−]
HF(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + F−(aq) Kc = [H3 O+][F−]
[HF]
NH3(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ NH4 +(aq) + OH−(aq) Kc = [NH4 +][OH−]
⎡
⎣NH3⎤
⎦
These examples all involve aqueous solutions, those in which water functions as the solvent. In the last two examples,
water also functions as a reactant, but its concentration is not included in the reaction quotient. The reason for this
omission is related to the more rigorous form of the Q (or K) expression mentioned previously in this chapter, in
which relative concentrations for liquids and solids are equal to 1 and needn’t be included. Consequently, reaction
quotients include concentration or pressure terms only for gaseous and solute species.
The equilibria below all involve gas-phase solutions:

For gas-phase solutions, the equilibrium constant may be expressed in terms of either the molar concentrations (Kc)
or partial pressures (Kp) of the reactants and products. A relation between these two K values may be simply derived
from the ideal gas equation and the definition of molarity:
PV = nRT
P = ⎛
⎝ n
V
⎞
⎠RT
= MRT
where P is partial pressure, V is volume, n is molar amount, R is the gas constant, T is temperature, and M is molar
concentration.
For the gas-phase reaction mA + nB ⇌ xC + yD:
KP =
⎛
⎝PC⎞
⎠x ⎛
⎝PD⎞
⎠ y
⎛
⎝P A⎞
⎠m ⎛

⎠n

⎛
⎝[A] × RT)m([B] × RT)n

[A]m[B]n × (RT)x+y
(RT)m+n
= Kc (RT)(x+y) − (m+n)
= Kc (RT)Δn
And so, the relationship between Kc and KP is
KP = Kc (RT)Δn
where Δn is the difference in the molar amounts of product and reactant gases, in this case:
Δn = (x+y) − (m+n)

Heterogeneous Equilibria
A heterogeneous equilibrium involves reactants and products in two or more different phases, as illustrated by the
following examples:
PbCl2(s) ⇌ Pb2+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq) Kc = [Pb2+][Cl−]2
CaO(s) + CO2(g) ⇌ CaCO3(s) Kc = 1

Coupled Equilibria
The equilibrium systems discussed so far have all been relatively simple, involving just single reversible reactions.
Many systems, however, involve two or more coupled equilibrium reactions, those which have in common one or
more reactant or product species. Since the law of mass action allows for a straightforward derivation of equilibrium
constant expressions from balanced chemical equations, the K value for a system involving coupled equilibria can
Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts 733
be related to the K values of the individual reactions. Three basic manipulations are involved in this approach, as
described below.
1. Changing the direction of a chemical equation essentially swaps the identities of “reactants” and “products,” and
so the equilibrium constant for the reversed equation is simply the reciprocal of that for the forward equation.
A ⇌ B Kc = [B]
[A]
B ⇌ A Kc' = [A]
[B]
Kc' = 1
Kc
2. Changing the stoichiometric coefficients in an equation by some factor x results in an exponential change in the
equilibrium constant by that same factor:
A ⇌ B Kc = [B]
[A]
xA ⇌ xB Kc' = [B]x
[A]x
Kc' = Kc x
3. Adding two or more equilibrium equations together yields an overall equation whose equilibrium constant is the
mathematical product of the individual reaction’s K values:
A ⇌ B Kc1 = [B]
[A]
B ⇌ C Kc2 = [C]
[B]
The net reaction for these coupled equilibria is obtained by summing the two equilibrium equations and canceling any
redundancies:
A + B ⇌ B + C
A + B ⇌ B + C
A ⇌ C Kc' = [C]
[A]
Comparing the equilibrium constant for the net reaction to those for the two coupled equilibrium reactions reveals the
following relationship:
Kc1 Kc2 = [B]
[A] × [C]
[B] = [B][C]
[A][B] = [C]
[A] = Kc'
Kc' = Kc1 Kc2
Example 13.5 demonstrates the use of this strategy in describing coupled equilibrium processes.

Solution
The equilibrium equation of interest and its K value may be derived from the equations for the two coupled
reactions as follows.
Reverse the first coupled reaction equation:

Answer: Kc = 0.14
13.3 Shifting Equilibria: Le Châtelier’s Principle
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the ways in which an equilibrium system can be stressed
• Predict the response of a stressed equilibrium using Le Châtelier’s principle
A system at equilibrium is in a state of dynamic balance, with forward and reverse reactions taking place at equal
rates. If an equilibrium system is subjected to a change in conditions that affects these reaction rates differently
(a stress), then the rates are no longer equal and the system is not at equilibrium. The system will subsequently
experience a net reaction in the direction of greater rate (a shift) that will re-establish the equilibrium. This
phenomenon is summarized by Le Châtelier’s principle: if an equilibrium system is stressed, the system will
experience a shift in response to the stress that re-establishes equilibrium.
Reaction rates are affected primarily by concentrations, as described by the reaction’s rate law, and temperature, as
described by the Arrhenius equation. Consequently, changes in concentration and temperature are the two stresses
that can shift an equilibrium.
Effect of a Change in Concentration
If an equilibrium system is subjected to a change in the concentration of a reactant or product species, the rate of
either the forward or the reverse reaction will change. As an example, consider the equilibrium reaction
Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts 735
H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g) Kc = 50.0 at 400 °C
The rate laws for the forward and reverse reactions are
f orward H2(g) + I2(g) → 2HI(g) rate f = k f [H2 ]m[I2 ]n
reverse 2HI(g) → H2(g) + I2(g) rater = kr[HI]x
When this system is at equilibrium, the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal.
rate f = rater
If the system is stressed by adding reactant, either H2 or I2, the resulting increase in concentration causes the rate of
the forward reaction to increase, exceeding that of the reverse reaction:
rate f > rater
The system will experience a temporary net reaction in the forward direction to re-establish equilibrium (the
equilibrium will shift right). This same shift will result if some product HI is removed from the system, which
decreases the rate of the reverse reaction, again resulting in the same imbalance in rates.
The same logic can be used to explain the left shift that results from either removing reactant or adding product to an
equilibrium system. These stresses both result in an increased rate for the reverse reaction
rate f < rater
and a temporary net reaction in the reverse direction to re-establish equilibrium.
As an alternative to this kinetic interpretation, the effect of changes in concentration on equilibria can be rationalized
in terms of reaction quotients. When the system is at equilibrium,
Qc = [HI]2
[H2][I2] = Kc
If reactant is added (increasing the denominator of the reaction quotient) or product is removed (decreasing the
numerator), then Qc < Kc and the equilibrium will shift right. Note that the three different ways of inducing this stress
result in three different changes in the composition of the equilibrium mixture. If H2 is added, the right shift will
consume I2 and produce HI as equilibrium is re-established, yielding a mixture with a greater concentrations of H2
and HI and a lesser concentration of I2 than was present before. If I2 is added, the new equilibrium mixture will have
greater concentrations of I2 and HI and a lesser concentration of H2. Finally, if HI is removed, the new equilibrium
mixture will have greater concentrations of H2 and I2 and a lesser concentration of HI. Despite these differences in
composition, the value of the equilibrium constant will be the same after the stress as it was before (per the law of
mass action). The same logic may be applied for stresses involving removing reactants or adding product, in which
case Qc > Kc and the equilibrium will shift left.
For gas-phase equilibria such as this one, some additional perspectives on changing the concentrations of reactants
and products are worthy of mention. The partial pressure P of an ideal gas is proportional to its molar concentration
M,
M = n
V = P
RT
and so changes in the partial pressures of any reactant or product are essentially changes in concentrations and thus
yield the same effects on equilibria. Aside from adding or removing reactant or product, the pressures (concentrations)
of species in a gas-phase equilibrium can also be changed by changing the volume occupied by the system. Since all
species of a gas-phase equilibrium occupy the same volume, a given change in volume will cause the same change in
concentration for both reactants and products. In order to discern what shift, if any, this type of stress will induce the
stoichiometry of the reaction must be considered.
At equilibrium, the reaction H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g) is described by the reaction quotient
736 Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Q p = PHI 2
PH2 PI2
= K p
If the volume occupied by an equilibrium mixture of these species is decreased by a factor of 3, the partial pressures
of all three species will be increased by a factor of 3:
Q p ' = (3PHI)2
3PH2 3PI2
= 9PHI2
9PH2 PI2
= PHI2
PH2 PI2
= Q p = K p
Q p ' = Q p = K p
And so, changing the volume of this gas-phase equilibrium mixture does not results in a shift of the equilibrium.
A similar treatment of a different system, 2NO2(g) ⇌ 2 NO(g) + O2(g), however, yields a different result:
Q p = PNO2 PO2
PNO22 = K p
Q p ' = (3PNO)2 3PO2
(3PNO2)2 = 9PNO2 3PO2
9PNO22 = 27PNO2 PO2
9PNO22 = 3Q p > K p
Q p ' = 3Q p > K p
In this case, the change in volume results in a reaction quotient greater than the equilibrium constant, and so the
equilibrium will shift left.
These results illustrate the relationship between the stoichiometry of a gas-phase equilibrium and the effect of a
volume-induced pressure (concentration) change. If the total molar amounts of reactants and products are equal,
as in the first example, a change in volume does not shift the equilibrium. If the molar amounts of reactants and
products are different, a change in volume will shift the equilibrium in a direction that better “accommodates” the
volume change. In the second example, two moles of reactant (NO2) yield three moles of product (2NO + O2), and
so decreasing the system volume causes the equilibrium to shift left since the reverse reaction produces less gas (2
mol) than the forward reaction (3 mol). Conversely, increasing the volume of this equilibrium system would result in
a shift towards products.

of how equilibrium changes with pressure changes.
Equilibrium and Soft Drinks
The connection between chemistry and carbonated soft drinks goes back to 1767, when Joseph Priestley
(1733–1804) developed a method of infusing water with carbon dioxide to make carbonated water. Priestly’s
approach involved production of carbon dioxidey reacting oil of vitriol (sulfuric acid) with chalk (calcium
carbonate).
The carbon dioxide was then dissolved in water, reacting to produce hydrogen carbonate, a weak acid that
subsequently ionized to yield bicarbonate and hydrogen ions:

Chemistry in Everyday Life
Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts 737
dissolution CO2(g) ⇌ CO2(aq)
hydrolysis CO2(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H2 CO3(aq)
ionization H2 CO3(aq) ⇌ HCO3 −(aq) + H+(aq)
These same equilibrium reactions are the basis of today’s soft-drink carbonation process. Beverages are
exposed to a high pressure of gaseous carbon dioxide during the process to shift the first equilibrium above
to the right, resulting in desirably high concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide and, per similar shifts in
the other two equilibria, its hydrolysis and ionization products. A bottle or can is then nearly filled with the
carbonated beverage, leaving a relatively small volume of air in the container above the beverage surface
(the headspace) before it is sealed. The pressure of carbon dioxide in the container headspace is very low
immediately after sealing, but it rises as the dissolution equilibrium is re-established by shifting to the left. Since
the volume of the beverage is significantly greater than the volume of the headspace, only a relatively small
amount of dissolved carbon dioxide is lost to the headspace.
When a carbonated beverage container is opened, a hissing sound is heard as pressurized CO2 escapes from
the headspace. This causes the dissolution equilibrium to shift left, resulting in a decrease in the concentration
of dissolved CO2 and subsequent left-shifts of the hydrolysis and ionization equilibria. Fortunately for the
consumer, the dissolution equilibrium is usually re-established slowly, and so the beverage may be enjoyed
while its dissolved carbon dioxide concentration remains palatably high. Once the equilibria are re-established,
the CO2(aq) concentration will be significantly lowered, and the beverage acquires a characteristic taste
referred to as “flat.”
Figure 13.7 Opening a soft-drink bottle lowers the CO2 pressure above the beverage, shifting the dissolution
equilibrium and releasing dissolved CO2 from the beverage. (credit: modification of work by “D
Coetzee”/Flickr)
Effect of a Change in Temperature
Consistent with the law of mass action, an equilibrium stressed by a change in concentration will shift to re-establish
equilibrium without any change in the value of the equilibrium constant, K. When an equilibrium shifts in response to
a temperature change, however, it is re-established with a different relative composition that exhibits a different value
for the equilibrium constant.
738 Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
To understand this phenomenon, consider the elementary reaction
A ⇌ B
Since this is an elementary reaction, the rates laws for the forward and reverse may be derived directly from the
balanced equation’s stoichiometry:
rate f = k f [A]
rater = kr[B]
When the system is at equilibrium,
rater = rate f
Substituting the rate laws into this equality and rearranging gives
k f [A] = kr[B]
[B]
[A] = k f
kr = Kc
The equilibrium constant is seen to be a mathematical function of the rate constants for the forward and reverse
reactions. Since the rate constants vary with temperature as described by the Arrhenius equation, is stands to reason
that the equilibrium constant will likewise vary with temperature (assuming the rate constants are affected to different
extents by the temperature change). For more complex reactions involving multistep reaction mechanisms, a similar
but more complex mathematical relation exists between the equilibrium constant and the rate constants of the steps
in the mechanism. Regardless of how complex the reaction may be, the temperature-dependence of its equilibrium
constant persists.
Predicting the shift an equilibrium will experience in response to a change in temperature is most conveniently
accomplished by considering the enthalpy change of the reaction. For example, the decomposition of dinitrogen
tetroxide is an endothermic (heat-consuming) process:
N2 O4(g) ⇌ 2NO2(g) ΔH = +57.20 kJ
For purposes of applying Le Chatelier’s principle, heat (q) may be viewed as a reactant:
heat + N2 O4(g) ⇌ 2NO2(g)
Raising the temperature of the system is akin to increasing the amount of a reactant, and so the equilibrium will
shift to the right. Lowering the system temperature will likewise cause the equilibrium to shift left. For exothermic
processes, heat is viewed as a product of the reaction and so the opposite temperature dependence is observed.
This interactive animation (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16chatelier) allows you to apply Le Châtelier’s
principle to predict the effects of changes in concentration, pressure, and temperature on reactant and
product concentrations.
Effect of a Catalyst
The kinetics chapter of this text identifies a catalyst as a substance that enables a reaction to proceed via a different
mechanism with an accelerated rate. The catalyzed reaction mechanism involves a lower energy transition state than
the uncatalyzed reaction, resulting in a lower activation energy, Ea, and a correspondingly greater rate constant.
To discern the effect of catalysis on an equilibrium system, consider the reaction diagram for a simple one-step
(elementary) reaction shown in Figure 13.8. The lowered transition state energy of the catalyzed reaction results in
lowered activation energies for both the forward and the reverse reactions. Consequently, both forward and reverse
Link to Learning
Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts 739
reactions are accelerated, and equilibrium is achieved more quickly but without a change in the equilibrium constant.
Figure 13.8 Reaction diagrams for an elementary process in the absence (red) and presence (blue) of a catalyst.
The presence of catalyst lowers the activation energies of both the forward and reverse reactions but does not affect
the value of the equilibrium constant.
An interesting case study highlighting these equilibrium concepts is the industrial production of ammonia, NH3. This
substance is among the “top 10” industrial chemicals with regard to production, with roughly two billion pounds
produced annually in the US. Ammonia is used as a chemical feedstock to synthesize a wide range of commercially
useful compounds, including fertilizers, plastics, dyes, and explosives.
Most industrial production of ammonia uses the Haber-Bosch process based on the following equilibrium reaction:
N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) ΔH = −92.2 kJ
The traits of this reaction present challenges to its use in an efficient industrial process. The equilibrium constant is
relatively small (Kp on the order of 10−5 at 25 °C), meaning very little ammonia is present in an equilibrium mixture.
Also, the rate of this reaction is relatively slow at low temperatures. To raise the yield of ammonia, the industrial
process is designed to operate under conditions favoring product formation:
• High pressures (concentrations) of reactants are used, ~150−250 atm, to shift the equilibrium right, favoring
product formation.
• Ammonia is continually removed (collected) from the equilibrium mixture during the process, lowering its
concentration and also shifting the equilibrium right.
• Although low temperatures favor product formation for this exothermic process, the reaction rate at low
temperatures is inefficiently slow. A catalyst is used to accelerate the reaction to reasonable rates at relatively
moderate temperatures (400−500 °C).
A diagram illustrating a typical industrial setup for production of ammonia via the Haber-Bosch process is shown in
Figure 13.9.

13.4 Equilibrium Calculations
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Identify the changes in concentration or pressure that occur for chemical species in equilibrium systems
• Calculate equilibrium concentrations or pressures and equilibrium constants, using various algebraic
approaches
Having covered the essential concepts of chemical equilibria in the preceding sections of this chapter, this final
section will demonstrate the more practical aspect of using these concepts and appropriate mathematical strategies
to perform various equilibrium calculations. These types of computations are essential to many areas of science and
technology—for example, in the formulation and dosing of pharmaceutical products. After a drug is ingested or
injected, it is typically involved in several chemical equilibria that affect its ultimate concentration in the body system
of interest. Knowledge of the quantitative aspects of these equilibria is required to compute a dosage amount that will
solicit the desired therapeutic effect.
Many of the useful equilibrium calculations that will be demonstrated here require terms representing changes in
reactant and product concentrations. These terms are derived from the stoichiometry of the reaction, as illustrated by
decomposition of ammonia:
2NH3(g) ⇌ N2(g) + 3H2(g)
As shown earlier in this chapter, this equilibrium may be established within a sealed container that initially contains
Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts 741
either NH3 only, or a mixture of any two of the three chemical species involved in the equilibrium. Regardless of its
initial composition, a reaction mixture will show the same relationships between changes in the concentrations of the
three species involved, as dictated by the reaction stoichiometry (see also the related content on expressing reaction
rates in the chapter on kinetics). For example, if the nitrogen concentration increases by an amount x:
Δ[N2] = + x
the corresponding changes in the other species concentrations are
Δ[H2] = Δ[N2]⎛
⎝
3 mol H2
1 mol N2
⎞
⎠ = +3x
Δ[NH3] = −Δ[N2]⎛
⎝
2 mol NH3
1 mol N2

⎠ = −2x
where the negative sign indicates a decrease in concentration.

Calculation of an Equilibrium Constant
The equilibrium constant for a reaction is calculated from the equilibrium concentrations (or pressures) of its
reactants and products. If these concentrations are known, the calculation simply involves their substitution into the K
expression, as was illustrated by Example 13.2. A slightly more challenging example is provided next, in which the
reaction stoichiometry is used to derive equilibrium concentrations from the information provided. The basic strategy
of this computation is helpful for many types of equilibrium computations and relies on the use of terms for the
742 Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts

reactant and product concentrations initially present, for how they change as the reaction proceeds, and for what they
are when the system reaches equilibrium. The acronym ICE is commonly used to refer to this mathematical approach,
and the concentrations terms are usually gathered in a tabular format called an ICE table.

Example 13.7
Calculation of an Equilibrium Constant
Iodine molecules react reversibly with iodide ions to produce triiodide ions.
I2(aq) + I−(aq) ⇌ I3 −(aq)
If a solution with the concentrations of I2 and I− both equal to 1.000 × 10−3 M before reaction gives an
equilibrium concentration of I2 of 6.61 × 10−4 M, what is the equilibrium constant for the reaction?
Solution
To calculate the equilibrium constants, equilibrium concentrations are needed for all the reactants and
products:
KC = [I3−]
[I2][I−]
Provided are the initial concentrations of the reactants and the equilibrium concentration of the product.
Use this information to derive terms for the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants, presenting all the
information in an ICE table.
At equilibrium the concentration of I2 is 6.61 × 10−4 M so that
1.000 × 10−3 − x = 6.61 × 10−4
x = 1.000 × 10−3 − 6.61 × 10−4
= 3.39 × 10−4 M
The ICE table may now be updated with numerical values for all its concentrations:
Finally, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the K expression and solve:
Kc = [I3 −]
[I2][I−]
= 3.39 × 10−4 M
(6.61 × 10−4 M)(6.61 × 10−4 M) = 776

Answer: Kc = 4
Calculation of a Missing Equilibrium Concentration
When the equilibrium constant and all but one equilibrium concentration are provided, the other equilibrium
concentration(s) may be calculated. A computation of this sort is illustrated in the next example exercise.
Example 13.8
Calculation of a Missing Equilibrium Concentration
Nitrogen oxides are air pollutants produced by the reaction of nitrogen and oxygen at high temperatures.
At 2000 °C, the value of the Kc for the reaction, N2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2NO(g), is 4.1 × 10−4. Calculate the
equilibrium concentration of NO(g) in air at 1 atm pressure and 2000 °C. The equilibrium concentrations of
N2 and O2 at this pressure and temperature are 0.036 M and 0.0089 M, respectively.
Solution
Substitute the provided quantities into the equilibrium constant expression and solve for [NO]:
Kc = [NO]2
⎡
⎣N2⎤
⎦ ⎡
⎣O2⎤
⎦
[NO]2 = Kc ⎡
⎣N2⎤
⎦ ⎡
⎣O2⎤
⎦
[NO] = Kc ⎡
⎣N2⎤
⎦ ⎡
⎣O2⎤
⎦
= (4.1 × 10−4)(0.036)(0.0089)
= 1.31 × 10−7
= 3.6 × 10−4
Thus [NO] is 3.6 × 10−4 mol/L at equilibrium under these conditions.
To confirm this result, it may be used along with the provided equilibrium concentrations to calculate a
value for K:
Kc = [NO]2
⎡
⎣N2⎤
⎦ ⎡
⎣O2⎤
⎦
= (3.6 × 10−4)2
(0.036)(0.0089)
= 4.0 × 10−4
This result is consistent with the provided value for K within nominal uncertainty, differing by just 1 in the
least significant digit’s place.

Answer: 1.53 mol/L
Calculation of Equilibrium Concentrations from Initial Concentrations
Perhaps the most challenging type of equilibrium calculation can be one in which equilibrium concentrations are
derived from initial concentrations and an equilibrium constant. For these calculations, a four-step approach is
typically useful:
1. Identify the direction in which the reaction will proceed to reach equilibrium.
2. Develop an ICE table.
3. Calculate the concentration changes and, subsequently, the equilibrium concentrations.
4. Confirm the calculated equilibrium concentrations.
The last two example exercises of this chapter demonstrate the application of this strategy.
Example 13.9
Calculation of Equilibrium Concentrations
Under certain conditions, the equilibrium constant Kc for the decomposition of PCl5(g) into PCl3(g) and
Cl2(g) is 0.0211. What are the equilibrium concentrations of PCl5, PCl3, and Cl2 in a mixture that initially
contained only PCl5 at a concentration of 1.00 M?
Solution
Use the stepwise process described earlier.
Step 1. Determine the direction the reaction proceeds.
The balanced equation for the decomposition of PCl5 is
PCl5(g) ⇌ PCl3(g) + Cl2(g)
Because only the reactant is present initially Qc = 0 and the reaction will proceed to the right.
Step 2. Develop an ICE table.
Step 3. Solve for the change and the equilibrium concentrations.
Substituting the equilibrium concentrations into the equilibrium constant equation gives
746 Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts

Kc = [PCl3][Cl2]
⎡
⎣PCl5⎤

= (x)(x)
(1.00 − x)
0.0211 = (x)(x)
(1.00 − x)
0.0211(1.00 − x) = x2
x2 + 0.0211x − 0.0211 = 0
Appendix B shows an equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0 can be rearranged to solve for x:
x = −b ± b2 − 4ac
2a
In this case, a = 1, b = 0.0211, and c = −0.0211. Substituting the appropriate values for a, b, and c
yields:
x = −0.0211 ± (0.0211)2 − 4(1)(−0.0211)
2(1)
= −0.0211 ± (4.45 × 10−4) + (8.44 × 10−2)
2
= −0.0211 ± 0.291
2
The two roots of the quadratic are, therefore,
x = −0.0211 + 0.291
2 = 0.135
and
x = −0.0211 − 0.291
2 = −0.156
For this scenario, only the positive root is physically meaningful (concentrations are either zero or
positive), and so x = 0.135 M.
The equilibrium concentrations are
⎡
⎣PCl5⎤
⎦ = 1.00 − 0.135 = 0.87 M
⎡
⎣PCl3⎤
⎦ = x = 0.135 M
⎡
⎣Cl2⎤
⎦ = x = 0.135 M
Step 4. Confirm the calculated equilibrium concentrations.
Substitution into the expression for Kc (to check the calculation) gives
Kc = [PCl3][Cl2]
[PCl5] = (0.135)(0.135)
0.87 = 0.021
The equilibrium constant calculated from the equilibrium concentrations is equal to the value of Kc
given in the problem (when rounded to the proper number of significant figures).

Example 13.10
Calculation of Equilibrium Concentrations Using an Algebra-Simplifying
Assumption
What are the concentrations at equilibrium of a 0.15 M solution of HCN?
HCN(aq) ⇌ H+(aq) + CN−(aq) Kc = 4.9 × 10−10
Solution
Using “x” to represent the concentration of each product at equilibrium gives this ICE table.
Substitute the equilibrium concentration terms into the Kc expression
Kc = (x)(x)
0.15 − x
rearrange to the quadratic form and solve for x
x2 + 4.9 × 10−10 − 7.35 × 10−11 = 0
x = 8.56 × 10−6 M (3 sig. figs.) = 8.6 × 10−6 M (2 sig. figs.)
Thus [H+] = [CN–] = x = 8.6 × 10–6 M and [HCN] = 0.15 – x = 0.15 M.
Note in this case that the change in concentration is significantly less than the initial concentration (a
consequence of the small K), and so the initial concentration experiences a negligible change:
if x ≪ 0.15 M, then (0.15 – x) ≈ 0.15
This approximation allows for a more expedient mathematical approach to the calculation that avoids the
need to solve for the roots of a quadratic equation:
Kc = (x)(x)
0.15 − x ≈ x2
0.15
4.9 × 10−10 = x2
0.15
x2 = (0.15)(4.9 × 10−10) = 7.4 × 10−11
x = 7.4 × 10−11 = 8.6 × 10−6 M
The value of x calculated is, indeed, much less than the initial concentration
8.6 × 10−6 ≪ 0.15
and so the approximation was justified. If this simplified approach were to yield a value for x that did not

Summary
13.1 Chemical Equilibria
A reversible reaction is at equilibrium when the forward and reverse processes occur at equal rates. Chemical
equilibria are dynamic processes characterized by constant amounts of reactant and product species.
13.2 Equilibrium Constants
The composition of a reaction mixture may be represented by a mathematical function known as the reaction quotient,
Q. For a reaction at equilibrium, the composition is constant, and Q is called the equilibrium constant, K.
A homogeneous equilibrium is an equilibrium in which all components are in the same phase. A heterogeneous
equilibrium is an equilibrium in which components are in two or more phases.
13.3 Shifting Equilibria: Le Châtelier’s Principle
Systems at equilibrium can be disturbed by changes to temperature, concentration, and, in some cases, volume and
pressure. The system’s response to these disturbances is described by Le Châtelier’s principle: An equilibrium system
subjected to a disturbance will shift in a way that counters the disturbance and re-establishes equilibrium. A catalyst
will increase the rate of both the forward and reverse reactions of a reversible process, increasing the rate at which
750 Chapter 13 | Fundamental Equilibrium Concepts

equilibrium is reached but not altering the equilibrium mixture’s composition (K does not change).
13.4 Equilibrium Calculations
Calculating values for equilibrium constants and/or equilibrium concentrations is of practical benefit to many
applications. A mathematical strategy that uses initial concentrations, changes in concentrations, and equilibrium
concentrations (and goes by the acronym ICE) is useful for several types of equilibrium calculations.

Introduction
Liquid water is essential to life on our planet, and chemistry involving the characteristic ions of water, H+ and OH−, is
widely encountered in nature and society. As introduced in another chapter of this text, acid-base chemistry involves
the transfer of hydrogen ions from donors (acids) to acceptors (bases). These H+ transfer reactions are reversible, and
the equilibria established by acid-base systems are essential aspects of phenomena ranging from sinkhole formation
(Figure 14.1) to oxygen transport in the human body. This chapter will further explore acid-base chemistry with an
emphasis on the equilibrium aspects of this important reaction class.
Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 763
14.1 Brønsted-Lowry Acids and Bases
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Identify acids, bases, and conjugate acid-base pairs according to the Brønsted-Lowry definition
• Write equations for acid and base ionization reactions
• Use the ion-product constant for water to calculate hydronium and hydroxide ion concentrations
• Describe the acid-base behavior of amphiprotic substances
The acid-base reaction class has been studied for quite some time. In 1680, Robert Boyle reported traits of acid
solutions that included their ability to dissolve many substances, to change the colors of certain natural dyes, and
to lose these traits after coming in contact with alkali (base) solutions. In the eighteenth century, it was recognized
that acids have a sour taste, react with limestone to liberate a gaseous substance (now known to be CO2), and
interact with alkalis to form neutral substances. In 1815, Humphry Davy contributed greatly to the development of the
modern acid-base concept by demonstrating that hydrogen is the essential constituent of acids. Around that same time,
Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac concluded that acids are substances that can neutralize bases and that these two classes of
substances can be defined only in terms of each other. The significance of hydrogen was reemphasized in 1884 when
Svante Arrhenius defined an acid as a compound that dissolves in water to yield hydrogen cations (now recognized
to be hydronium ions) and a base as a compound that dissolves in water to yield hydroxide anions.
Johannes Brønsted and Thomas Lowry proposed a more general description in 1923 in which acids and bases were
defined in terms of the transfer of hydrogen ions, H+. (Note that these hydrogen ions are often referred to simply
as protons, since that subatomic particle is the only component of cations derived from the most abundant hydrogen
isotope, 1H.) A compound that donates a proton to another compound is called a Brønsted-Lowry acid, and a
compound that accepts a proton is called a Brønsted-Lowry base. An acid-base reaction is, thus, the transfer of a
proton from a donor (acid) to an acceptor (base).
The concept of conjugate pairs is useful in describing Brønsted-Lowry acid-base reactions (and other reversible
reactions, as well). When an acid donates H+, the species that remains is called the conjugate base of the acid because
it reacts as a proton acceptor in the reverse reaction. Likewise, when a base accepts H+, it is converted to its conjugate
acid. The reaction between water and ammonia illustrates this idea. In the forward direction, water acts as an acid
by donating a proton to ammonia and subsequently becoming a hydroxide ion, OH−, the conjugate base of water.
The ammonia acts as a base in accepting this proton, becoming an ammonium ion, NH4+ , the conjugate acid of
ammonia. In the reverse direction, a hydroxide ion acts as a base in accepting a proton from ammonium ion, which
acts as an acid.
The reaction between a Brønsted-Lowry acid and water is called acid ionization. For example, when hydrogen
fluoride dissolves in water and ionizes, protons are transferred from hydrogen fluoride molecules to water molecules,
yielding hydronium ions and fluoride ions:
764 Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Base ionization of a species occurs when it accepts protons from water molecules. In the example below, pyridine
molecules, C5NH5, undergo base ionization when dissolved in water, yielding hydroxide and pyridinium ions:
The preceding ionization reactions suggest that water may function as both a base (as in its reaction with hydrogen
fluoride) and an acid (as in its reaction with ammonia). Species capable of either donating or accepting protons are
called amphiprotric, or more generally, amphoteric, a term that may be used for acids and bases per definitions other
than the Brønsted-Lowry one. The equations below show the two possible acid-base reactions for two amphiprotic
species, bicarbonate ion and water:
HCO3 – ⎛
⎝aq⎞
⎠ + H2 O⎛
⎝l⎞
⎠ CO3 2–⎛
⎝aq⎞
⎠ + H3 O+ ⎛
⎝aq⎞
⎠
HCO3 – ⎛
⎝aq⎞
⎠ + H2 O⎛
⎝l⎞
⎠ H2 CO3⎛
⎝aq⎞
⎠ + OH–⎛
⎝aq⎞
⎠
The first equation represents the reaction of bicarbonate as an acid with water as a base, whereas the second represents
reaction of bicarbonate as a base with water as an acid. When bicarbonate is added to water, both these equilibria
are established simultaneously and the composition of the resulting solution may be determined through appropriate
equilibrium calculations, as described later in this chapter.
In the liquid state, molecules of an amphiprotic substance can react with one another as illustrated for water in the
equations below:
The process in which like molecules react to yield ions is called autoionization. Liquid water undergoes
autoionization to a very slight extent; at 25 °C, approximately two out of every billion water molecules are ionized.
The extent of the water autoionization process is reflected in the value of its equilibrium constant, the ion-product
constant for water, Kw:
H2 O(l) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + OH−(aq) Kw = [H3 O+][OH−]
The slight ionization of pure water is reflected in the small value of the equilibrium constant; at 25 °C, Kw has a
value of 1.0 × 10−14. The process is endothermic, and so the extent of ionization and the resulting concentrations of
hydronium ion and hydroxide ion increase with temperature. For example, at 100 °C, the value for Kw is about 5.6 ×
Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 765
10−13, roughly 50 times larger than the value at 25 °C.
Example 14.1
Ion Concentrations in Pure Water
What are the hydronium ion concentration and the hydroxide ion concentration in pure water at 25 °C?
Solution
The autoionization of water yields the same number of hydronium and hydroxide ions. Therefore, in pure
water, [H3O+] = [OH−] = x. At 25 °C:
Kw = [H3 O+][OH−] = x = 1.0 × 10−14
So:
x = [H3 O+] = [OH−] = 1.0 × 10−14 = 1.0 × 10−7 M
The hydronium ion concentration and the hydroxide ion concentration are the same, 1.0 × 10−7 M.

Example 14.2
The Inverse Relation between [H3O+] and [OH−]
A solution of an acid in water has a hydronium ion concentration of 2.0 × 10−6 M. What is the
concentration of hydroxide ion at 25 °C?
Solution
Use the value of the ion-product constant for water at 25 °C
2H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + OH−(aq) Kw = [H3 O+][OH−] = 1.0 × 10−14
to calculate the missing equilibrium concentration.
Rearrangement of the Kw expression shows that [OH−] is inversely proportional to [H3O+]:
[OH−] = Kw
[H3 O+] = 1.0 × 10−14
2.0 × 10−6 = 5.0 × 10−9
Compared with pure water, a solution of acid exhibits a higher concentration of hydronium ions (due to
ionization of the acid) and a proportionally lower concentration of hydroxide ions. This may be explained
via Le Châtelier’s principle as a left shift in the water autoionization equilibrium resulting from the stress of
increased hydronium ion concentration.
Substituting the ion concentrations into the Kw expression confirms this calculation, resulting in the
expected value:
Kw = [H3 O+][OH−] = (2.0 × 10−6)(5.0 × 10−9) = 1.0 × 10−14

14.2 pH and pOH
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the characterization of aqueous solutions as acidic, basic, or neutral
• Express hydronium and hydroxide ion concentrations on the pH and pOH scales
• Perform calculations relating pH and pOH
As discussed earlier, hydronium and hydroxide ions are present both in pure water and in all aqueous solutions, and
their concentrations are inversely proportional as determined by the ion product of water (Kw). The concentrations
of these ions in a solution are often critical determinants of the solution’s properties and the chemical behaviors of
its other solutes, and specific vocabulary has been developed to describe these concentrations in relative terms. A
solution is neutral if it contains equal concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions; acidic if it contains a greater
concentration of hydronium ions than hydroxide ions; and basic if it contains a lesser concentration of hydronium
ions than hydroxide ions.
A common means of expressing quantities that may span many orders of magnitude is to use a logarithmic scale.
One such scale that is very popular for chemical concentrations and equilibrium constants is based on the p-function,
defined as shown where “X” is the quantity of interest and “log” is the base-10 logarithm:
pX = −log X
The pH of a solution is therefore defined as shown here, where [H3O+] is the molar concentration of hydronium ion
in the solution:
Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 767
pH = −log[H3 O+]
Rearranging this equation to isolate the hydronium ion molarity yields the equivalent expression:
[H3 O+] = 10−pH
Likewise, the hydroxide ion molarity may be expressed as a p-function, or pOH:
pOH = −log[OH−]
or
[OH−] = 10−pOH
Finally, the relation between these two ion concentration expressed as p-functions is easily derived from the Kw
expression:
Kw = [H3 O+][OH−]
−log Kw = −log⎛
⎝[H3 O+][OH−]⎞
⎠ = −log[H3 O+] + −log[OH−]
pKw = pH + pOH
At 25 °C, the value of Kw is 1.0 × 10−14, and so:
14.00 = pH + pOH
As was shown in Example 14.1, the hydronium ion molarity in pure water (or any neutral solution) is 1.0 × 10−7
M at 25 °C. The pH and pOH of a neutral solution at this temperature are therefore:
pH = −log[H3 O+] = −log(1.0 × 10−7) = 7.00
pOH = −log[OH−] = −log(1.0 × 10−7) = 7.00
And so, at this temperature, acidic solutions are those with hydronium ion molarities greater than 1.0 × 10−7 M
and hydroxide ion molarities less than 1.0 × 10−7 M (corresponding to pH values less than 7.00 and pOH values
greater than 7.00). Basic solutions are those with hydronium ion molarities less than 1.0 × 10−7 M and hydroxide ion
molarities greater than 1.0 × 10−7 M (corresponding to pH values greater than 7.00 and pOH values less than 7.00).
Since the autoionization constant Kw is temperature dependent, these correlations between pH values and the acidic/
neutral/basic adjectives will be different at temperatures other than 25 °C. For example, the “Check Your Learning”
exercise accompanying Example 14.1 showed the hydronium molarity of pure water at 80 °C is 4.9 × 10−7 M,
which corresponds to pH and pOH values of:
pH = −log[H3 O+] = −log(4.9 × 10−7) = 6.31
pOH = −log[OH−] = −log(4.9 × 10−7) = 6.31
At this temperature, then, neutral solutions exhibit pH = pOH = 6.31, acidic solutions exhibit pH less than 6.31 and
pOH greater than 6.31, whereas basic solutions exhibit pH greater than 6.31 and pOH less than 6.31. This distinction
can be important when studying certain processes that occur at other temperatures, such as enzyme reactions in warm-
blooded organisms at a temperature around 36–40 °C. Unless otherwise noted, references to pH values are presumed
to be those at 25 °C (Table 14.1).

Normal rainwater has a pH between 5 and 6 due to the presence of dissolved CO2 which forms carbonic acid:
H2 O(l) + CO2(g) ⟶ H2 CO3(aq)
H2 CO3(aq) ⇌ H+(aq) + HCO3 −(aq)
Acid rain is rainwater that has a pH of less than 5, due to a variety of nonmetal oxides, including CO2, SO2,
SO3, NO, and NO2 being dissolved in the water and reacting with it to form not only carbonic acid, but sulfuric
acid and nitric acid. The formation and subsequent ionization of sulfuric acid are shown here:

Carbon dioxide is naturally present in the atmosphere because most organisms produce it as a waste product
of metabolism. Carbon dioxide is also formed when fires release carbon stored in vegetation or fossil fuels.

make it possible for the nitrogen and oxygen in air to chemically combine.
Acid rain is a particular problem in industrial areas where the products of combustion and smelting are released
into the air without being stripped of sulfur and nitrogen oxides. In North America and Europe until the 1980s,
it was responsible for the destruction of forests and freshwater lakes, when the acidity of the rain actually
killed trees, damaged soil, and made lakes uninhabitable for all but the most acid-tolerant species. Acid rain
also corrodes statuary and building facades that are made of marble and limestone (Figure 14.3). Regulations
limiting the amount of sulfur and nitrogen oxides that can be released into the atmosphere by industry and
automobiles have reduced the severity of acid damage to both natural and manmade environments in North
America and Europe. It is now a growing problem in industrial areas of China and India.

14.3 Relative Strengths of Acids and Bases
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Assess the relative strengths of acids and bases according to their ionization constants
• Rationalize trends in acid–base strength in relation to molecular structure
• Carry out equilibrium calculations for weak acid–base systems
Acid and Base Ionization Constants
The relative strength of an acid or base is the extent to which it ionizes when dissolved in water. If the ionization
reaction is essentially complete, the acid or base is termed strong; if relatively little ionization occurs, the acid or base
is weak. As will be evident throughout the remainder of this chapter, there are many more weak acids and bases than
strong ones. The most common strong acids and bases are listed in Figure 14.6.
Figure 14.6 Some of the common strong acids and bases are listed here.
The relative strengths of acids may be quantified by measuring their equilibrium constants in aqueous solutions. In
solutions of the same concentration, stronger acids ionize to a greater extent, and so yield higher concentrations of
Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 773
hydronium ions than do weaker acids. The equilibrium constant for an acid is called the acid-ionization constant,
Ka. For the reaction of an acid HA:
HA(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + A−(aq),
the acid ionization constant is written
Ka = [H3 O+][A−]
[HA]
where the concentrations are those at equilibrium. Although water is a reactant in the reaction, it is the solvent as well,
so we do not include [H2O] in the equation. The larger the Ka of an acid, the larger the concentration of H3 O+ and
A− relative to the concentration of the nonionized acid, HA, in an equilibrium mixture, and the stronger the acid. An
acid is classified as “strong” when it undergoes complete ionization, in which case the concentration of HA is zero
and the acid ionization constant is immeasurably large (Ka ≈ ∞). Acids that are partially ionized are called “weak,”
and their acid ionization constants may be experimentally measured. A table of ionization constants for weak acids is
provided in Appendix H.
To illustrate this idea, three acid ionization equations and Ka values are shown below. The ionization constants
increase from first to last of the listed equations, indicating the relative acid strength increases in the order CH3CO2H
< HNO2 < HSO4 − :
CH3 CO2 H(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + CH3 CO2 −(aq) Ka = 1.8 × 10−5
HNO2(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + NO2 −(aq) Ka = 4.6 × 10−4
HSO4 −(aq) + H2 O(aq) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + SO4 2−(aq) Ka = 1.2 × 10−2
Another measure of the strength of an acid is its percent ionization. The percent ionization of a weak acid is defined
in terms of the composition of an equilibrium mixture:
% ionization = [H3 O+]eq
[HA]0
× 100
where the numerator is equivalent to the concentration of the acid's conjugate base (per stoichiometry, [A−] = [H3O+]).
Unlike the Ka value, the percent ionization of a weak acid varies with the initial concentration of acid, typically
decreasing as concentration increases. Equilibrium calculations of the sort described later in this chapter can be used
to confirm this behavior.
Example 14.7
Calculation of Percent Ionization from pH
Calculate the percent ionization of a 0.125-M solution of nitrous acid (a weak acid), with a pH of 2.09.
Solution
The percent ionization for an acid is:
[H3 O+]eq

× 100
Converting the provided pH to hydronium ion molarity yields
[H3 O+ ] = 10−2.09 = 0.0081 M
Substituting this value and the provided initial acid concentration into the percent ionization equation gives

the certainty of the computed percent ionization.)

the molecular level.
Just as for acids, the relative strength of a base is reflected in the magnitude of its base-ionization constant (Kb)
in aqueous solutions. In solutions of the same concentration, stronger bases ionize to a greater extent, and so yield
higher hydroxide ion concentrations than do weaker bases. A stronger base has a larger ionization constant than does
a weaker base. For the reaction of a base, B:
B(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ HB+(aq) + OH−(aq),
the ionization constant is written as
Kb = [HB+][OH−]
[B]
Inspection of the data for three weak bases presented below shows the base strength increases in the order
NO2 − < CH2 CO2 − < NH3.
NO2 −(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ HNO2(aq) + OH−(aq) Kb = 2.17 × 10−11
CH3 CO2 −(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ CH3 CO2 H(aq) + OH−(aq) Kb = 5.6 × 10−10
NH3(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ NH4 +(aq) + OH−(aq) Kb = 1.8 × 10−5
A table of ionization constants for weak bases appears in Appendix I. As for acids, the relative strength of a base is
also reflected in its percent ionization, computed as
% ionization = [OH−]eq /[B]0 ×100%
but will vary depending on the base ionization constant and the initial concentration of the solution.
Relative Strengths of Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs
Brønsted-Lowry acid-base chemistry is the transfer of protons; thus, logic suggests a relation between the relative
strengths of conjugate acid-base pairs. The strength of an acid or base is quantified in its ionization constant, Ka or
Kb, which represents the extent of the acid or base ionization reaction. For the conjugate acid-base pair HA / A−,
ionization equilibrium equations and ionization constant expressions are
Link to Learning
Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 775
HA(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + A−(aq) Ka = [H3 O+][A−]
[HA]
A−(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ OH−(aq) + HA(aq) Kb = [HA][OH]
[A−]
Adding these two chemical equations yields the equation for the autoionization for water:
HA(aq) + H2 O(l) + A−(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + A−(aq) + OH−(aq) + HA(aq)
2H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + OH−(aq)
As discussed in another chapter on equilibrium, the equilibrium constant for a summed reaction is equal to the
mathematical product of the equilibrium constants for the added reactions, and so
Ka × Kb = [H3 O+][A−]
[HA] × [HA][OH−]
[A−] = [H3 O+][OH−] = Kw
This equation states the relation between ionization constants for any conjugate acid-base pair, namely, their
mathematical product is equal to the ion product of water, Kw. By rearranging this equation, a reciprocal relation
between the strengths of a conjugate acid-base pair becomes evident:
Ka = Kw /Kb or Kb = Kw /Ka
The inverse proportional relation between Ka and Kb means the stronger the acid or base, the weaker its conjugate
partner. Figure 14.7 illustrates this relation for several conjugate acid-base pairs.
Figure 14.7 Relative strengths of several conjugate acid-base pairs are shown.

Figure 14.8 This figure shows strengths of conjugate acid-base pairs relative to the strength of water as the
reference substance.
The listing of conjugate acid–base pairs shown in Figure 14.8 is arranged to show the relative strength of each
species as compared with water, whose entries are highlighted in each of the table’s columns. In the acid column,
those species listed below water are weaker acids than water. These species do not undergo acid ionization in water;
they are not Bronsted-Lowry acids. All the species listed above water are stronger acids, transferring protons to water
to some extent when dissolved in an aqueous solution to generate hydronium ions. Species above water but below
hydronium ion are weak acids, undergoing partial acid ionization, wheres those above hydronium ion are strong acids
that are completely ionized in aqueous solution.
If all these strong acids are completely ionized in water, why does the column indicate they vary in strength, with
nitric acid being the weakest and perchloric acid the strongest? Notice that the sole acid species present in an aqueous
solution of any strong acid is H3O+(aq), meaning that hydronium ion is the strongest acid that may exist in water; any
stronger acid will react completely with water to generate hydronium ions. This limit on the acid strength of solutes in
a solution is called a leveling effect. To measure the differences in acid strength for “strong” acids, the acids must be
dissolved in a solvent that is less basic than water. In such solvents, the acids will be “weak,” and so any differences
in the extent of their ionization can be determined. For example, the binary hydrogen halides HCl, HBr, and HI are
Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 777
strong acids in water but weak acids in ethanol (strength increasing HCl < HBr < HI).
The right column of Figure 14.8 lists a number of substances in order of increasing base strength from top to bottom.
Following the same logic as for the left column, species listed above water are weaker bases and so they don’t undergo
base ionization when dissolved in water. Species listed between water and its conjugate base, hydroxide ion, are weak
bases that partially ionize. Species listed below hydroxide ion are strong bases that completely ionize in water to yield
hydroxide ions (i.e., they are leveled to hydroxide). A comparison of the acid and base columns in this table supports
the reciprocal relation between the strengths of conjugate acid-base pairs. For example, the conjugate bases of the
strong acids (top of table) are all of negligible strength. A strong acid exhibits an immeasurably large Ka, and so its
conjugate base will exhibit a Kb that is essentially zero:
strong acid : Ka ≈ ∞
conjugate base : Kb = Kw /Ka = Kw /∞ ≈ 0
A similar approach can be used to support the observation that conjugate acids of strong bases (Kb ≈ ∞) are of
negligible strength (Ka ≈ 0).
Example 14.8
Calculating Ionization Constants for Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs
Use the Kb for the nitrite ion, NO2 −, to calculate the Ka for its conjugate acid.
Solution
Kb for NO2 − is given in this section as 2.17 × 10−11. The conjugate acid of NO2 − is HNO2; Ka for
HNO2 can be calculated using the relationship:
Ka × Kb = 1.0 × 10−14 = Kw
Solving for Ka yields
Ka = Kw
Kb
= 1.0 × 10−14
2.17 × 10−11 = 4.6 × 10−4

Determination of Ka or Kb from pH
The pH of a 0.0516-M solution of nitrous acid, HNO2, is 2.34. What is its Ka?
HNO2(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + NO2 −(aq)
Solution
The nitrous acid concentration provided is a formal concentration, one that does not account for any
chemical equilibria that may be established in solution. Such concentrations are treated as “initial” values
for equilibrium calculations using the ICE table approach. Notice the initial value of hydronium ion is
listed as approximately zero because a small concentration of H3O+ is present (1 × 10−7 M) due to the
autoprotolysis of water. In many cases, such as all the ones presented in this chapter, this concentration is
much less than that generated by ionization of the acid (or base) in question and may be neglected.
The pH provided is a logarithmic measure of the hydronium ion concentration resulting from the acid
ionization of the nitrous acid, and so it represents an “equilibrium” value for the ICE table:
[H3 O+ ] = 10−2.34 = 0.0046 M
The ICE table for this system is then
Finally, calculate the value of the equilibrium constant using the data in the table:
Ka = [H3 O+][NO2 −]
[HNO2] = (0.0046)(0.0046)

What is the concentration of hydronium ion and the pH of a 0.534-M solution of formic acid?
HCO2 H(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + HCO2 −(aq) Ka = 1.8 × 10−4
Solution
The ICE table for this system is
Substituting the equilibrium concentration terms into the Ka expression gives
Ka = 1.8 × 10−4 = [H3 O+][HCO2 −]
[HCO2 H]
= (x)(x)
0.534 − x = 1.8 × 10−4
The relatively large initial concentration and small equilibrium constant permits the simplifying assumption
that x will be much lesser than 0.534, and so the equation becomes
Ka = 1.8 × 10−4 = x2
0.534
Solving the equation for x yields
782 Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
x2 = 0.534 × ⎛
⎝1.8 × 10−4⎞
⎠ = 9.6 × 10−5
x = 9.6 × 10−5
= 9.8 × 10−3 M
To check the assumption that x is small compared to 0.534, its relative magnitude can be estimated:
x
0.534 = 9.8 × 10−3
0.534 = 1.8 × 10−2 (1.8% of 0.534)
Because x is less than 5% of the initial concentration, the assumption is valid.
As defined in the ICE table, x is equal to the equilibrium concentration of hydronium ion:
x = [H3 O+ ] = 0.0098 M
Finally, the pH is calculated to be
pH = −log[H3 O+ ] = −log(0.0098) = 2.01

weak base:
(CH3)3 N(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ (CH3)3 NH+(aq) + OH−(aq) Kb = 6.3 × 10−5
Solution
The ICE table for this system is
Substituting the equilibrium concentration terms into the Kb expression gives
Kb = [(CH3)3 NH+][OH−]
[(CH3)3 N] = (x)(x)
0.25 − x = 6.3 × 10−5
Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 783
Assuming x << 0.25 and solving for x yields
x = 4.0 × 10−3 M
This value is less than 5% of the initial concentration (0.25), so the assumption is justified.
As defined in the ICE table, x is equal to the equilibrium concentration of hydroxide ion:
[OH−] = ~ 0 + x = x = 4.0 × 10−3 M
= 4.0 × 10−3 M
The pOH is calculated to be
pOH = −log⎛
⎝4.0 × 10−3⎞
⎠ = 2.40
Using the relation introduced in the previous section of this chapter:
pH + pOH = pKw = 14.00
permits the computation of pH:

weak base with a Kb of 1.76 × 10−5.
Answer: 7.56 × 10−4 M, 2.33%
In some cases, the strength of the weak acid or base and its formal (initial) concentration result in an appreciable
ionization. Though the ICE strategy remains effective for these systems, the algebra is a bit more involved because the
simplifying assumption that x is negligible can not be made. Calculations of this sort are demonstrated in Example

Solution
The ICE table for this system is
784 Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Substituting the equilibrium concentration terms into the Ka expression gives
Ka = 1.2 × 10−2 = [H3 O+][SO4 2−]
[HSO4 −] = (x)(x)
0.50 − x
If the assumption that x << 0.5 is made, simplifying and solving the above equation yields
x = 0.077 M
This value of x is clearly not significantly less than 0.50 M; rather, it is approximately 15% of the initial
concentration:
When we check the assumption, we calculate:
x
[HSO4 −]i
x
0.50 = 7.7 × 10−2
0.50 = 0.15 (15%)
Because the simplifying assumption is not valid for this system, the equilibrium constant expression is
solved as follows:
Ka = 1.2 × 10−2 = (x)(x)
0.50 − x
Rearranging this equation yields
6.0 × 10−3 − 1.2 × 10−2 x = x2
Writing the equation in quadratic form gives
x2 + 1.2 × 10−2 x − 6.0 × 10−3 = 0
Solving for the two roots of this quadratic equation results in a negative value that may be discarded as
physically irrelevant and a positive value equal to x. As defined in the ICE table, x is equal to the hydronium
concentration.

Effect of Molecular Structure on Acid-Base Strength
Binary Acids and Bases
In the absence of any leveling effect, the acid strength of binary compounds of hydrogen with nonmetals (A) increases
as the H-A bond strength decreases down a group in the periodic table. For group 17, the order of increasing acidity
is HF < HCl < HBr < HI. Likewise, for group 16, the order of increasing acid strength is H2O < H2S < H2Se < H2Te.
Across a row in the periodic table, the acid strength of binary hydrogen compounds increases with increasing
electronegativity of the nonmetal atom because the polarity of the H-A bond increases. Thus, the order of increasing
acidity (for removal of one proton) across the second row is CH4 < NH3 < H2O < HF; across the third row, it is SiH4
< PH3 < H2S < HCl (see Figure 14.11).
Figure 14.11 The figure shows trends in the strengths of binary acids and bases.
Ternary Acids and Bases
Ternary compounds composed of hydrogen, oxygen, and some third element (“E”) may be structured as depicted in
the image below. In these compounds, the central E atom is bonded to one or more O atoms, and at least one of the
O atoms is also bonded to an H atom, corresponding to the general molecular formula OmE(OH)n. These compounds
may be acidic, basic, or amphoteric depending on the properties of the central E atom. Examples of such compounds
include sulfuric acid, O2S(OH)2, sulfurous acid, OS(OH)2, nitric acid, O2NOH, perchloric acid, O3ClOH, aluminum
hydroxide, Al(OH)3, calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, and potassium hydroxide, KOH:
786 Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
If the central atom, E, has a low electronegativity, its attraction for electrons is low. Little tendency exists for the
central atom to form a strong covalent bond with the oxygen atom, and bond a between the element and oxygen is
more readily broken than bond b between oxygen and hydrogen. Hence bond a is ionic, hydroxide ions are released to
the solution, and the material behaves as a base—this is the case with Ca(OH)2 and KOH. Lower electronegativity is
characteristic of the more metallic elements; hence, the metallic elements form ionic hydroxides that are by definition
basic compounds.
If, on the other hand, the atom E has a relatively high electronegativity, it strongly attracts the electrons it shares
with the oxygen atom, making bond a relatively strongly covalent. The oxygen-hydrogen bond, bond b, is thereby
weakened because electrons are displaced toward E. Bond b is polar and readily releases hydrogen ions to the
solution, so the material behaves as an acid. High electronegativities are characteristic of the more nonmetallic
elements. Thus, nonmetallic elements form covalent compounds containing acidic −OH groups that are called
oxyacids.
Increasing the oxidation number of the central atom E also increases the acidity of an oxyacid because this increases
the attraction of E for the electrons it shares with oxygen and thereby weakens the O-H bond. Sulfuric acid, H2SO4,
or O2S(OH)2 (with a sulfur oxidation number of +6), is more acidic than sulfurous acid, H2SO3, or OS(OH)2 (with a
sulfur oxidation number of +4). Likewise nitric acid, HNO3, or O2NOH (N oxidation number = +5), is more acidic
than nitrous acid, HNO2, or ONOH (N oxidation number = +3). In each of these pairs, the oxidation number of the
central atom is larger for the stronger acid (Figure 14.12).
Figure 14.12 As the oxidation number of the central atom E increases, the acidity also increases.
Hydroxy compounds of elements with intermediate electronegativities and relatively high oxidation numbers (for
example, elements near the diagonal line separating the metals from the nonmetals in the periodic table) are usually
amphoteric. This means that the hydroxy compounds act as acids when they react with strong bases and as bases
when they react with strong acids. The amphoterism of aluminum hydroxide, which commonly exists as the hydrate
Al(H2O)3(OH)3, is reflected in its solubility in both strong acids and strong bases. In strong bases, the relatively
insoluble hydrated aluminum hydroxide, Al(H2O)3(OH)3, is converted into the soluble ion, [Al(H2 O)2(OH)4]−, by
reaction with hydroxide ion:
Al(H2 O)3(OH)3(aq) + OH−(aq) ⇌ H2 O(l) + [Al(H2 O)2(OH)4]−(aq)
In this reaction, a proton is transferred from one of the aluminum-bound H2O molecules to a hydroxide ion in solution.
The Al(H2O)3(OH)3 compound thus acts as an acid under these conditions. On the other hand, when dissolved in
strong acids, it is converted to the soluble ion [Al(H2 O)6]3+ by reaction with hydronium ion:
Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 787
3H3 O+(aq) + Al(H2 O)3(OH)3(aq) ⇌ Al(H2 O)6 3+(aq) + 3H2 O(l)
In this case, protons are transferred from hydronium ions in solution to Al(H2O)3(OH)3, and the compound functions
as a base.
14.4 Hydrolysis of Salts
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Predict whether a salt solution will be acidic, basic, or neutral
• Calculate the concentrations of the various species in a salt solution
• Describe the acid ionization of hydrated metal ions
Salts with Acidic Ions
Salts are ionic compounds composed of cations and anions, either of which may be capable of undergoing an acid
or base ionization reaction with water. Aqueous salt solutions, therefore, may be acidic, basic, or neutral, depending
on the relative acid-base strengths of the salt's constituent ions. For example, dissolving ammonium chloride in water
results in its dissociation, as described by the equation
NH4 Cl(s) ⇌ NH4 + (aq) + Cl− (aq)
The ammonium ion is the conjugate acid of the weak base ammonia, NH3, and so it will undergo acid ionization (or
acid hydrolysis):
NH4 +(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + NH3(aq)
Salts are ionic compounds composed of cations and anions, either of which may be capable of undergoing an acid
or base ionization reaction with water. Aqueous salt solutions, therefore, may be acidic, basic, or neutral, depending
on the relative acid-base strengths of the salt’s constituent ions. For example, dissolving the ammonium chloride in
water results in its dissociation, as described by the equation
NH4 Cl(s) ⇌ NH4 + (aq) + Cl− (aq)
The ammonium ion is the conjugate acid of the base ammonia, NH3; its acid ionization (or acid hydrolysis) reaction
is represented by
NH4 +(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + NH3(aq) K a = K w /K b
Since ammonia is a weak base, Kb is measurable and Ka > 0 (ammonium ion is a weak acid).
The chloride ion is the conjugate base of hydrochloric acid, and so its base ionization (or base hydrolysis) reaction is
represented by
Cl− (aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ HCl(aq) + OH− (aq) Kb = Kw /Ka
Since HCl is a strong acid, Ka is immeasurably large and Kb ≈ 0 (chloride ions don’t undergo appreciable hydrolysis).
Thus, dissolving ammonium chloride in water yields a solution of weak acid cations ( NH4 + ) and inert anions (Cl−),
resulting in an acidic solution.

The Ka for anilinium ion is derived from the Kb for its conjugate base, aniline (see Appendix H):
Ka = Kw
Kb

4.3 × 10−10 = 2.3 × 10−5
Using the provided information, an ICE table for this system is prepared:
Substituting these equilibrium concentration terms into the Ka expression gives
Ka = [C6 H5 NH2][H3 O+ ]/[C6 H5 NH3 + ]
2.3 × 10−5 = (x)(x)/0.233 − x)
Assuming x << 0.233, the equation is simplified and solved for x:
2.3 × 10−5 = x2 /0.233
x = 0.0023 M
The ICE table defines x as the hydronium ion molarity, and so the pH is computed as
pH = − log[H3 O+ ] = −log(0.0023) = 2.64

Salts with Basic Ions
As another example, consider dissolving sodium acetate in water:
NaCH3 CO2(s) Na + (aq) + CH3 CO2 − (aq)
The sodium ion does not undergo appreciable acid or base ionization and has no effect on the solution pH. This may
seem obvious from the ion's formula, which indicates no hydrogen or oxygen atoms, but some dissolved metal ions
function as weak acids, as addressed later in this section.
The acetate ion, CH3 CO2 − , is the conjugate base of acetic acid, CH3CO2H, and so its base ionization (or base
hydrolysis) reaction is represented by
CH3 CO2 − (aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ CH3 CO2 H(aq) + OH − (aq) Kb = Kw /Ka
Because acetic acid is a weak acid, its Ka is measurable and Kb > 0 (acetate ion is a weak base).
Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 789
Dissolving sodium acetate in water yields a solution of inert cations (Na+) and weak base anions (CH3 CO2 − ),
resulting in a basic solution.
Example 14.16

Solution
The provided equilibrium concentrations and a value for the equilibrium constant will permit calculation
of the missing equilibrium concentration. The process in question is the base ionization of acetate ion, for
which
Kb (for CH3 CO2 −) = Kw
Ka (for CH3 CO2 H) = 1.0 × 10−14
1.8 × 10−5 = 5.6 × 10−10
Substituting the available values into the Kb expression gives
Kb = [CH3 CO2 H][OH−]
[CH3 CO2 −] = 5.6 × 10−10
= [CH3 CO2 H](2.5 × 10−6)
(0.050) = 5.6 × 10−10
Solving the above equation for the acetic acid molarity yields [CH3CO2H] = 1.1 × 10−5 M.

Salts with Acidic and Basic Ions
Some salts are composed of both acidic and basic ions, and so the pH of their solutions will depend on the relative
strengths of these two species. Likewise, some salts contain a single ion that is amphiprotic, and so the relative
strengths of this ion’s acid and base character will determine its effect on solution pH. For both types of salts, a
comparison of the Ka and Kb values allows prediction of the solution’s acid-base status, as illustrated in the following
example exercise.

(a) The K+ cation is inert and will not affect pH. The bromide ion is the conjugate base of a strong acid, and
so it is of negligible base strength (no appreciable base ionization). The solution is neutral.
(b) The Na+ cation is inert and will not affect the pH of the solution; while the HCO3 − anion is
amphiprotic. The Ka of HCO3 − is 4.7 × 10−11,and its Kb is 1.0 × 10−14
4.3 × 10−7 = 2.3 × 10−8.
Since Kb >> Ka, the solution is basic.
(c) The Na+ cation is inert and will not affect the pH of the solution, while the HPO4 2− anion is
amphiprotic. The Ka of HPO4 2− is 4.2 × 10−13,
and its Kb is 1.0 × 10−14
6.2 × 10−8 = 1.6 × 10−7. Because Kb >> Ka, the solution is basic.
(d) The NH4 + ion is acidic (see above discussion) and the F− ion is basic (conjugate base of the weak acid
HF). Comparing the two ionization constants: Ka of NH4 + is 5.6 × 10−10 and the Kb of F− is 1.4 × 10−11,
so the solution is acidic, since Ka > Kb.

The Ionization of Hydrated Metal Ions
Unlike the group 1 and 2 metal ions of the preceding examples (Na+, Ca2+, etc.), some metal ions function as acids
in aqueous solutions. These ions are not just loosely solvated by water molecules when dissolved, instead they
are covalently bonded to a fixed number of water molecules to yield a complex ion (see chapter on coordination
chemistry). As an example, the dissolution of aluminum nitrate in water is typically represented as
Al(NO3)(s) ⇌ Al3 + (aq) + 3NO3 − (aq)
However, the aluminum(III) ion actually reacts with six water molecules to form a stable complex ion, and so the
more explicit representation of the dissolution process is
Al(NO3)3(s) + 6H2 O(l) ⇌ Al(H2 O)6 3+(aq) + 3NO3 −(aq)
As shown in Figure 14.13, the Al(H2 O)6 3+ ions involve bonds between a central Al atom and the O atoms of the
six water molecules. Consequently, the bonded water molecules' O–H bonds are more polar than in nonbonded water
molecules, making the bonded molecules more prone to donation of a hydrogen ion:
Al(H2 O)6 3+(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + Al(H2 O)5(OH)2+(aq) Ka = 1.4 × 10−5
The conjugate base produced by this process contains five other bonded water molecules capable of acting as acids,
and so the sequential or step-wise transfer of protons is possible as depicted in few equations below:
Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 791
Al(H2 O)6 3+(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + Al(H2 O)5(OH)2+(aq)
Al(H2 O)5(OH)2+(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + Al(H2 O)4(OH)2 +(aq)
Al(H2 O)4(OH)2 +(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + Al(H2 O)3(OH)3(aq)
This is an example of a polyprotic acid, the topic of discussion in a later section of this chapter.
Figure 14.13 When an aluminum ion reacts with water, the hydrated aluminum ion becomes a weak acid.
Aside from the alkali metals (group 1) and some alkaline earth metals (group 2), most other metal ions will undergo
acid ionization to some extent when dissolved in water. The acid strength of these complex ions typically increases
with increasing charge and decreasing size of the metal ions. The first-step acid ionization equations for a few other
acidic metal ions are shown below:
Fe(H2 O)6 3+(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + Fe(H2 O)5(OH)2+(aq) pK a = 2.74
Cu(H2 O)6 2+(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + Cu(H2 O)5(OH)+(aq) pK a = ~ 6.3
Zn(H2 O)4 2+(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + Zn(H2 O)3(OH)+(aq) pK a = 9.6

Assuming x << 0.10 and solving the simplified equation gives:

14.5 Polyprotic Acids
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Extend previously introduced equilibrium concepts to acids and bases that may donate or accept more than
one proton
Acids are classified by the number of protons per molecule that they can give up in a reaction. Acids such as HCl,
HNO3, and HCN that contain one ionizable hydrogen atom in each molecule are called monoprotic acids. Their
reactions with water are:
HCl(aq) + H2 O(l) ⟶ H3 O+(aq) + Cl−(aq)
HNO3(aq) + H2 O(l) ⟶ H3 O+(aq) + NO3 −(aq)
HCN(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + CN−(aq)
Even though it contains four hydrogen atoms, acetic acid, CH3CO2H, is also monoprotic because only the hydrogen
atom from the carboxyl group (COOH) reacts with bases:
Similarly, monoprotic bases are bases that will accept a single proton.
Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 793
Diprotic acids contain two ionizable hydrogen atoms per molecule; ionization of such acids occurs in two steps. The
first ionization always takes place to a greater extent than the second ionization. For example, sulfuric acid, a strong
acid, ionizes as follows:
First ionization: H2 SO4(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + HSO4 −(aq) Ka1 = more than 102 ; complete dissociation
Second ionization: HSO4 −(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + SO4 2−(aq) Ka2 = 1.2 × 10−2
This stepwise ionization process occurs for all polyprotic acids. Carbonic acid, H2CO3, is an example of a weak
diprotic acid. The first ionization of carbonic acid yields hydronium ions and bicarbonate ions in small amounts.
First ionization:
H2 CO3(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + HCO3 −(aq) KH2 CO3 = [H3 O+][HCO3 −]
[H2 CO3] = 4.3 × 10−7
The bicarbonate ion can also act as an acid. It ionizes and forms hydronium ions and carbonate ions in even smaller
quantities.
Second ionization:
HCO3 −(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + CO3 2−(aq) KHCO3 − = [H3 O+][CO3 2−]
[HCO3 −] = 4.7 × 10−11
KH2 CO3 is larger than KHCO3 − by a factor of 104, so H2CO3 is the dominant producer of hydronium ion in the
solution. This means that little of the HCO3 − formed by the ionization of H2CO3 ionizes to give hydronium ions
(and carbonate ions), and the concentrations of H3O+ and HCO3 − are practically equal in a pure aqueous solution
of H2CO3.
If the first ionization constant of a weak diprotic acid is larger than the second by a factor of at least 20, it is
appropriate to treat the first ionization separately and calculate concentrations resulting from it before calculating
concentrations of species resulting from subsequent ionization. This approach is demonstrated in the following
example exercise.
Example 14.19
Ionization of a Diprotic Acid
“Carbonated water” contains a palatable amount of dissolved carbon dioxide. The solution is acidic because
CO2 reacts with water to form carbonic acid, H2CO3. What are [H3 O+], [HCO3 −], and [CO3 2−] in a
saturated solution of CO2 with an initial [H2CO3] = 0.033 M?
H2 CO3(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + HCO3 −(aq) Ka1 = 4.3 × 10−7
HCO3 −(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + CO3 2−(aq) Ka2 = 4.7 × 10−11
Solution
As indicated by the ionization constants, H2CO3 is a much stronger acid than HCO3 −, so the stepwise
ionization reactions may be treated separately.
The first ionization reaction is
H2 CO3(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + HCO3 −(aq) Ka1 = 4.3 × 10−7
Using provided information, an ICE table for this first step is prepared:

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations into the equilibrium equation gives
KH2 CO3 = [H3 O+][HCO3 −]
[H2 CO3] = (x)(x)
0.033 − x = 4.3 × 10−7
Assuming x << 0.033 and solving the simplified equation yields
x = 1.2 × 10−4
The ICE table defined x as equal to the bicarbonate ion molarity and the hydronium ion molarity:
[H2 CO3] = 0.033 M
[H3 O+] = [HCO3 −] = 1.2 × 10−4 M
Using the bicarbonate ion concentration computed above, the second ionization is subjected to a similar
equilibrium calculation:
HCO3 −(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + CO3 2−(aq)
KHCO3 − = [H3 O+][CO3 2−]
[HCO3 −] = (1.2 × 10−4)[CO3 2−]
1.2 × 10−4
[CO3 2−] = (4.7 × 10−11)(1.2 × 10−4)
1.2 × 10−4 = 4.7 × 10−11 M
To summarize: at equilibrium [H2CO3] = 0.033 M; [H3 O+] = 1.2 × 10−4; [HCO3 −] = 1.2 × 10−4 M;
[CO3 2−] = 5.6 × 10−11 M.

The concentration of H2S in a saturated aqueous solution at room temperature is approximately 0.1 M.

Answer: [H2S] = 0.1 M; [H3 O+] = [HS−] = 0.000094 M; [S2−] = 1 × 10−19 M
A triprotic acid is an acid that has three ionizable H atoms. Phosphoric acid is one example:
Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 795
First ionization: H3 PO4(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + H2 PO4 −(aq) Ka1 = 7.5 × 10−3
Second ionization: H2 PO4 −(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + HPO4 2−(aq) Ka2 = 6.2 × 10−8
Third ionization: HPO4 2−(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + PO4 3−(aq) Ka3 = 4.2 × 10−13
As for the diprotic acid examples, each successive ionization reaction is less extensive than the former, reflected in
decreasing values for the stepwise acid ionization constants. This is a general characteristic of polyprotic acids and
successive ionization constants often differ by a factor of about 105 to 106.
This set of three dissociation reactions may appear to make calculations of equilibrium concentrations in a solution
of H3PO4 complicated. However, because the successive ionization constants differ by a factor of 105 to 106, large
differences exist in the small changes in concentration accompanying the ionization reactions. This allows the use of
math-simplifying assumptions and processes, as demonstrated in the examples above.
Polyprotic bases are capable of accepting more than one hydrogen ion. The carbonate ion is an example of a diprotic
base, because it can accept two protons, as shown below. Similar to the case for polyprotic acids, note the ionization
constants decrease with ionization step. Likewise, equilibrium calculations involving polyprotic bases follow the
same approaches as those for polyprotic acids.
H2 O(l) + CO3 2−(aq) ⇌ HCO3 − (aq) + OH− (aq) Kb1 = 2.1 × 10−4
H2 O(l) + HCO3 − (aq) ⇌ H2 CO3(aq) + OH− (aq) Kb2 = 2.3 × 10−8
14.6 Buffers
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the composition and function of acid–base buffers
• Calculate the pH of a buffer before and after the addition of added acid or base
A solution containing appreciable amounts of a weak conjugate acid-base pair is called a buffer solution, or a buffer.
Buffer solutions resist a change in pH when small amounts of a strong acid or a strong base are added (Figure 14.14).
A solution of acetic acid and sodium acetate (CH3COOH + CH3COONa) is an example of a buffer that consists of a
weak acid and its salt. An example of a buffer that consists of a weak base and its salt is a solution of ammonia and
ammonium chloride (NH3(aq) + NH4Cl(aq)).
Figure 14.14 (a) The buffered solution on the left and the unbuffered solution on the right have the same pH (pH 8);
they are basic, showing the yellow color of the indicator methyl orange at this pH. (b) After the addition of 1 mL of a
0.01-M HCl solution, the buffered solution has not detectably changed its pH but the unbuffered solution has become
acidic, as indicated by the change in color of the methyl orange, which turns red at a pH of about 4. (credit:

How Buffers Work
To illustrate the function of a buffer solution, consider a mixture of roughly equal amounts of acetic acid and sodium
acetate. The presence of a weak conjugate acid-base pair in the solution imparts the ability to neutralize modest
amounts of added strong acid or base. For example, adding strong base to this solution will neutralize hydronium ion
and shift the acetic acid ionization equilibrium to the right, partially restoring the decreased H3O+ concentration:
CH3 CO2 H(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + CH3 CO2 −(aq)
Likewise, adding strong acid to this buffer solution will neutralize acetate ion, shifting the above ionization
equilibrium right and returning [H3O+] to near its original value. Figure 14.15 provides a graphical illustration of
the changes in conjugate-partner concentration that occur in this buffer solution when strong acid and base are added.
The buffering action of the solution is essentially a result of the added strong acid and base being converted to the
weak acid and base that make up the buffer's conjugate pair. The weaker acid and base undergo only slight ionization,
as compared with the complete ionization of the strong acid and base, and the solution pH, therefore, changes much
less drastically than it would in an unbuffered solution.

Example 14.20
pH Changes in Buffered and Unbuffered Solutions
Acetate buffers are used in biochemical studies of enzymes and other chemical components of cells to
prevent pH changes that might affect the biochemical activity of these compounds.
(a) Calculate the pH of an acetate buffer that is a mixture with 0.10 M acetic acid and 0.10 M sodium acetate.
(b) Calculate the pH after 1.0 mL of 0.10 NaOH is added to 100 mL of this buffer.
(c) For comparison, calculate the pH after 1.0 mL of 0.10 M NaOH is added to 100 mL of a solution of an
unbuffered solution with a pH of 4.74.
Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 797
Solution
(a) Following the ICE approach to this equilibrium calculation yields the following:
Substituting the equilibrium concentration terms into the Ka expression, assuming x << 0.10, and solving
the simplified equation for x yields
x = 1.8 × 10−5 M
[H3 O+] = 0 + x = 1.8 × 10−5 M
pH = −log[H3 O+] = −log(1.8 × 10−5)
= 4.74
(b) Calculate the pH after 1.0 mL of 0.10 M NaOH is added to 100 mL of this buffer.
Adding strong acid will neutralize some of the acetic acid, yielding the conjugate base acetate ion. Compute
the new concentrations of these two buffer components, then repeat the equilibrium calculation of part (a)
using these new concentrations.
0.0010 L × ⎛

0.100 L × ⎛
⎝

⎠ = 1.00 × 10−2 mol CH3 CO2 H
The amount of acetic acid remaining after some is neutralized by the added base is
(1.0 × 10−2) − (0.01 × 10−2) = 0.99 × 10−2 mol CH3 CO2 H
The newly formed acetate ion, along with the initially present acetate, gives a final acetate concentration of
(1.0 × 10−2) + (0.01 × 10−2) = 1.01 × 10−2 mol NaCH3 CO2
Compute molar concentrations for the two buffer components:
[CH3 CO2 H] = 9.9 × 10−3 mol
0.101 L = 0.098 M
[NaCH3 CO2] = 1.01 × 10−2 mol
0.101 L = 0.100 M
Using these concentrations, the pH of the solution may be computed as in part (a) above, yielding pH = 4.75
(only slightly different from that prior to adding the strong base).
(c) For comparison, calculate the pH after 1.0 mL of 0.10 M NaOH is added to 100 mL of a solution of an
unbuffered solution with a pH of 4.74.
The amount of hydrogen ion initially present in the solution is
[H3 O+ ] = 10−4.74 = 1.8 × 10−5 M
mol H3 O+ = (0.100 L)(1.8 × 10−5 M) = 1.8 × 10−6 mol H3 O+
The amount of hydroxide ion added to the solution is
798 Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
mol OH− = (0.0010 L)(0.10 M) = 1.0 × 10−4 mol OH−
The added hydroxide will neutralize hydronium ion via the reaction
H3 O+ (aq) + OH− (aq) 2H2 O(l)
The 1:1 stoichiometry of this reaction shows that an excess of hydroxide has been added (greater molar
amount than the initially present hydronium ion).
The amount of hydroxide ion remaining is
1.0 × 10−4 mol − 1.8 × 10−6 mol = 9.8 × 10−5 mol OH−
corresponding to a hydroxide molarity of
9.8 × 10−5 mol OH− /0.101 L = 9.7 × 10−4 M
The pH of the solution is then calculated to be
pH = 14.00 − pOH = 14.00 − − log(9.7 × 10−4) = 10.99
In this unbuffered solution, addition of the base results in a significant rise in pH (from 4.74 to 10.99)
compared with the very slight increase observed for the buffer solution in part (b) (from 4.74 to 4.75).

Buffer Capacity
Buffer solutions do not have an unlimited capacity to keep the pH relatively constant (Figure 14.16). Instead, the
ability of a buffer solution to resist changes in pH relies on the presence of appreciable amounts of its conjugate weak
acid-base pair. When enough strong acid or base is added to substantially lower the concentration of either member
of the buffer pair, the buffering action within the solution is compromised.
Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 799
Figure 14.16 The indicator color (methyl orange) shows that a small amount of acid added to a buffered solution of
pH 8 (beaker on the left) has little affect on the buffered system (middle beaker). However, a large amount of acid
exhausts the buffering capacity of the solution and the pH changes dramatically (beaker on the right). (credit:
modification of work by Mark Ott)
The buffer capacity is the amount of acid or base that can be added to a given volume of a buffer solution before
the pH changes significantly, usually by one unit. Buffer capacity depends on the amounts of the weak acid and its
conjugate base that are in a buffer mixture. For example, 1 L of a solution that is 1.0 M in acetic acid and 1.0 M in
sodium acetate has a greater buffer capacity than 1 L of a solution that is 0.10 M in acetic acid and 0.10 M in sodium
acetate even though both solutions have the same pH. The first solution has more buffer capacity because it contains
more acetic acid and acetate ion.
Selection of Suitable Buffer Mixtures
There are two useful rules of thumb for selecting buffer mixtures:
1. A good buffer mixture should have about equal concentrations of both of its components. A buffer solution
has generally lost its usefulness when one component of the buffer pair is less than about 10% of the other.
Figure 14.17 shows how pH changes for an acetic acid-acetate ion buffer as base is added. The initial pH is
4.74. A change of 1 pH unit occurs when the acetic acid concentration is reduced to 11% of the acetate ion
concentration.

Figure 14.17 Change in pH as an increasing amount of a 0.10-M NaOH solution is added to 100 mL of a
buffer solution in which, initially, [CH3CO2H] = 0.10 M and [CH3 CO2 −] = 0.10 M. Note the greatly
diminished buffering action occurring after the buffer capacity has been reached, resulting in drastic rises in
pH on adding more strong base.
2. Weak acids and their salts are better as buffers for pHs less than 7; weak bases and their salts are better as
buffers for pHs greater than 7.
Blood is an important example of a buffered solution, with the principal acid and ion responsible for the buffering
action being carbonic acid, H2CO3, and the bicarbonate ion, HCO3 −. When a hydronium ion is introduced to the
blood stream, it is removed primarily by the reaction:
H3 O+(aq) + HCO3 −(aq) ⟶ H2 CO3(aq) + H2 O(l)
An added hydroxide ion is removed by the reaction:
OH−(aq) + H2 CO3(aq) ⟶ HCO3 −(aq) + H2 O(l)
The added strong acid or base is thus effectively converted to the much weaker acid or base of the buffer pair (H3O+
is converted to H2CO3 and OH- is converted to HCO3-). The pH of human blood thus remains very near the value
determined by the buffer pairs pKa, in this case, 7.35. Normal variations in blood pH are usually less than 0.1, and
pH changes of 0.4 or greater are likely to be fatal.
The Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation
The ionization-constant expression for a solution of a weak acid can be written as:
Ka = [H3 O+][A−]
[HA]
Rearranging to solve for [H3O+] yields:
[H3 O+] = Ka × [HA]
[A−]
Taking the negative logarithm of both sides of this equation gives
Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 801
−log[H3 O+] = −logKa − log[HA]
[A−] ,
which can be written as
pH = pKa + log [A−]
[HA]
where pKa is the negative of the logarithm of the ionization constant of the weak acid (pKa = −log Ka). This equation
relates the pH, the ionization constant of a weak acid, and the concentrations of the weak conjugate acid-base pair in a
buffered solution. Scientists often use this expression, called the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, to calculate the
pH of buffer solutions. It is important to note that the “x is small” assumption must be valid to use this equation.
Lawrence Joseph Henderson and Karl Albert Hasselbalch
Lawrence Joseph Henderson (1878–1942) was an American physician, biochemist and physiologist, to name
only a few of his many pursuits. He obtained a medical degree from Harvard and then spent 2 years
studying in Strasbourg, then a part of Germany, before returning to take a lecturer position at Harvard. He
eventually became a professor at Harvard and worked there his entire life. He discovered that the acid-base
balance in human blood is regulated by a buffer system formed by the dissolved carbon dioxide in blood. He
wrote an equation in 1908 to describe the carbonic acid-carbonate buffer system in blood. Henderson was
broadly knowledgeable; in addition to his important research on the physiology of blood, he also wrote on the
adaptations of organisms and their fit with their environments, on sociology and on university education. He
also founded the Fatigue Laboratory, at the Harvard Business School, which examined human physiology with
specific focus on work in industry, exercise, and nutrition.
In 1916, Karl Albert Hasselbalch (1874–1962), a Danish physician and chemist, shared authorship in a paper
with Christian Bohr in 1904 that described the Bohr effect, which showed that the ability of hemoglobin in the
blood to bind with oxygen was inversely related to the acidity of the blood and the concentration of carbon
dioxide. The pH scale was introduced in 1909 by another Dane, Sørensen, and in 1912, Hasselbalch published
measurements of the pH of blood. In 1916, Hasselbalch expressed Henderson’s equation in logarithmic terms,
consistent with the logarithmic scale of pH, and thus the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation was born.
Medicine: The Buffer System in Blood
The normal pH of human blood is about 7.4. The carbonate buffer system in the blood uses the following
equilibrium reaction:
CO2(g) + 2H2 O(l) ⇌ H2 CO3(aq) ⇌ HCO3 −(aq) + H3 O+(aq)
The concentration of carbonic acid, H2CO3 is approximately 0.0012 M, and the concentration of the hydrogen
carbonate ion, HCO3 −, is around 0.024 M. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and the pKa of
carbonic acid at body temperature, we can calculate the pH of blood:
pH = pKa + log [base]
[acid] = 6.4 + log 0.024
0.0012 = 7.7
The fact that the H2CO3 concentration is significantly lower than that of the HCO3 − ion may seem unusual,
but this imbalance is due to the fact that most of the by-products of our metabolism that enter our bloodstream
are acidic. Therefore, there must be a larger proportion of base than acid, so that the capacity of the buffer will
not be exceeded.

Lactic acid is produced in our muscles when we exercise. As the lactic acid enters the bloodstream, it is
neutralized by the HCO3 − ion, producing H2CO3. An enzyme then accelerates the breakdown of the excess
carbonic acid to carbon dioxide and water, which can be eliminated by breathing. In fact, in addition to the
regulating effects of the carbonate buffering system on the pH of blood, the body uses breathing to regulate
blood pH. If the pH of the blood decreases too far, an increase in breathing removes CO2 from the blood
through the lungs driving the equilibrium reaction such that [H3O+] is lowered. If the blood is too alkaline, a
lower breath rate increases CO2 concentration in the blood, driving the equilibrium reaction the other way,
increasing [H+] and restoring an appropriate pH.

14.7 Acid-Base Titrations
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Interpret titration curves for strong and weak acid-base systems
• Compute sample pH at important stages of a titration
• Explain the function of acid-base indicators
As seen in the chapter on the stoichiometry of chemical reactions, titrations can be used to quantitatively analyze
solutions for their acid or base concentrations. In this section, we will explore the underlying chemical equilibria that
make acid-base titrimetry a useful analytical technique.
Titration Curves
A titration curve is a plot of some solution property versus the amount of added titrant. For acid-base titrations,
solution pH is a useful property to monitor because it varies predictably with the solution composition and, therefore,
may be used to monitor the titration’s progress and detect its end point. The following example exercise demonstrates
the computation of pH for a titration solution after additions of several specified titrant volumes. The first example
involves a strong acid titration that requires only stoichiometric calculations to derive the solution pH. The second
example addresses a weak acid titration requiring equilibrium calculations.
Example 14.21
Calculating pH for Titration Solutions: Strong Acid/Strong Base
A titration is carried out for 25.00 mL of 0.100 M HCl (strong acid) with 0.100 M of a strong base NaOH
(the titration curve is shown in Figure 14.18). Calculate the pH at these volumes of added base solution:
(a) 0.00 mL
(b) 12.50 mL
(c) 25.00 mL
Link to Learning
Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 803
(d) 37.50 mL
Solution
(a) Titrant volume = 0 mL. The solution pH is due to the acid ionization of HCl. Because this is a strong
acid, the ionization is complete and the hydronium ion molarity is 0.100 M. The pH of the solution is then
pH = − log (0.100) = 1.000
(b) Titrant volume = 12.50 mL. Since the acid sample and the base titrant are both monoprotic and equally
concentrated, this titrant addition involves less than a stoichiometric amount of base, and so it is completely
consumed by reaction with the excess acid in the sample. The concentration of acid remaining is computed
by subtracting the consumed amount from the intial amount and then dividing by the solution volume:
[H3 O+] = n(H+)
V = 0.002500 mol × ⎛
⎝ 1000 mL
1 L
⎞
⎠ − 0.100 M × 12.50 mL
25.00 mL + 12.50 mL = 0.0333 M
(c) Titrant volume = 25.00 mL. This titrant addition involves a stoichiometric amount of base (the
equivalence point), and so only products of the neutralization reaction are in solution (water and NaCl).
Neither the cation nor the anion of this salt undergo acid-base ionization; the only process generating
hydronium ions is the autoprotolysis of water. The solution is neutral, having a pH = 7.00.
(d) Titrant volume = 37.50 mL. This involves the addition of titrant in excess of the equivalence point. The
solution pH is then calculated using the concentration of hydroxide ion:
n(OH−)0 > n(H+)0
[OH−] = n(OH−)
V = 0.100 M × 35.70 mL − 0.002500 mol × ⎛
⎝ 1000 mL

⎠
25.00 mL + 37.50 mL = 0.0200 M

(b) The acid and titrant are both monoprotic and the sample and titrant solutions are equally concentrated;
thus, this volume of titrant represents the equivalence point. Unlike the strong-acid example above,
however, the reaction mixture in this case contains a weak conjugate base (acetate ion). The solution pH is

1.8 × 10−5 = 5.6 × 10−10
Assuming x << 0.0500, the pH may be calculated via the usual ICE approach: Kb = x2
0.0500 M
x = [OH−] = 5.3 × 10−6
pOH = −log(5.3 × 10−6) = 5.28
pH = 14.00 − 5.28 = 8.72
Note that the pH at the equivalence point of this titration is significantly greater than 7, as expected when
titrating a weak acid with a strong base.
(c) Titrant volume = 12.50 mL. This volume represents one-half of the stoichiometric amount of titrant,
and so one-half of the acetic acid has been neutralized to yield an equivalent amount of acetate ion.
The concentrations of these conjugate acid-base partners, therefore, are equal. A convenient approach to
computing the pH is use of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
pH = pKa + log [Base]
[Acid] = −log(Ka) + log [CH3 CO2 −]
[CH3 CO2 H] = −log(1.8 × 10−5) + log(1)
pH = −log(1.8 × 10−5) = 4.74
(pH = pKa at the half-equivalence point in a titration of a weak acid)
(d) Titrant volume = 37.50 mL. This volume represents a stoichiometric excess of titrant, and a reaction
solution containing both the titration product, acetate ion, and the excess strong titrant. In such solutions,
the solution pH is determined primarily by the amount of excess strong base:
[OH−] = (0.003750 mol − 0.00250 mol)
0.06250 L = 2.00 × 10−2 M
pOH = −log⎛
⎝2.00 × 10−2⎞
⎠ = 1.70, and pH = 14.00 − 1.70 = 12.30

14.2 and plotted as titration curves in Figure 14.18. A comparison of these two curves illustrates several important
concepts that are best addressed by identifying the four stages of a titration:
initial state (added titrant volume = 0 mL): pH is determined by the acid being titrated; because the two acid samples
are equally concentrated, the weak acid will exhibit a greater initial pH
pre-equivalence point (0 mL < V < 25 mL): solution pH increases gradually and the acid is consumed by reaction
with added titrant; composition includes unreacted acid and the reaction product, its conjugate base
equivalence point (V = 25 mL): a drastic rise in pH is observed as the solution composition transitions from acidic to
either neutral (for the strong acid sample) or basic (for the weak acid sample), with pH determined by ionization of
the conjugate base of the acid
postequivalence point (V > 25 mL): pH is determined by the amount of excess strong base titrant added; since both
samples are titrated with the same titrant, both titration curves appear similar at this stage.

Acid-Base Indicators
Certain organic substances change color in dilute solution when the hydronium ion concentration reaches a particular
value. For example, phenolphthalein is a colorless substance in any aqueous solution with a hydronium ion
concentration greater than 5.0 × 10−9 M (pH < 8.3). In more basic solutions where the hydronium ion concentration
is less than 5.0 × 10−9 M (pH > 8.3), it is red or pink. Substances such as phenolphthalein, which can be used to
determine the pH of a solution, are called acid-base indicators. Acid-base indicators are either weak organic acids or
weak organic bases.
The equilibrium in a solution of the acid-base indicator methyl orange, a weak acid, can be represented by an equation
in which we use HIn as a simple representation for the complex methyl orange molecule:
HIn(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + In−(aq)
red yellow
Ka = [H3 O+][In−]
[HIn] = 4.0 × 10−4
The anion of methyl orange, In−, is yellow, and the nonionized form, HIn, is red. When we add acid to a solution
of methyl orange, the increased hydronium ion concentration shifts the equilibrium toward the nonionized red form,
in accordance with Le Châtelier’s principle. If we add base, we shift the equilibrium towards the yellow form. This
behavior is completely analogous to the action of buffers.
The perceived color of an indicator solution is determined by the ratio of the concentrations of the two species In− and
HIn. If most of the indicator (typically about 60−90% or more) is present as In−, the perceived color of the solution is
yellow. If most is present as HIn, then the solution color appears red. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is useful
for understanding the relationship between the pH of an indicator solution and its composition (thus, perceived color):
Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 807
pH = pKa + log⎛
⎝ [In−]
[HIn]
⎞
⎠
In solutions where pH > pKa, the logarithmic term must be positive, indicating an excess of the conjugate base form of
the indicator (yellow solution). When pH > pKa, the log term must be negative, indicating an excess of the conjugate
acid (red solution). When the solution pH is close to the indicator pKa, appreciable amounts of both conjugate partners
are present, and the solution color is that of an additive combination of each (yellow and red, yielding orange). The
color change interval (or pH interval) for an acid-base indicator is defined as the range of pH values over which a
change in color is observed, and for most indicators this range is approximately pKa ± 1.
There are many different acid-base indicators that cover a wide range of pH values and can be used to determine
the approximate pH of an unknown solution by a process of elimination. Universal indicators and pH paper contain
a mixture of indicators and exhibit different colors at different pHs. Figure 14.19 presents several indicators, their
colors, and their color-change intervals.
Figure 14.19 This chart illustrates the color change intervals for several acid-base indicators.

Figure 14.20 Titration curves for strong and weak acids illustrating the proper choice of acid-base indicator. Any of
the three indicators will exhibit a reasonably sharp color change at the equivalence point of the strong acid titration,
but only phenolphthalein is suitable for use in the weak acid titration.
The titration curves shown in Figure 14.20 illustrate the choice of a suitable indicator for specific titrations. In
the strong acid titration, use of any of the three indicators should yield reasonably sharp color changes and accurate
end point determinations. For this titration, the solution pH reaches the lower limit of the methyl orange color
change interval after addition of ~24 mL of titrant, at which point the initially red solution would begin to appear
orange. When 25 mL of titrant has been added (the equivalence point), the pH is well above the upper limit and
the solution will appear yellow. The titration's end point may then be estimated as the volume of titrant that yields
a distinct orange-to-yellow color change. This color change would be challenging for most human eyes to precisely
discern. More-accurate estimates of the titration end point are possible using either litmus or phenolphthalein, both of
which exhibit color change intervals that are encompassed by the steep rise in pH that occurs around the 25.00 mL
equivalence point.
The weak acid titration curve in Figure 14.20 shows that only one of the three indicators is suitable for end point
detection. If methyl orange is used in this titration, the solution will undergo a gradual red-to-orange-to-yellow color
change over a relatively large volume interval (0–6 mL), completing the color change well before the equivalence
point (25 mL) has been reached. Use of litmus would show a color change that begins after adding 7–8 mL of titrant
and ends just before the equivalence point. Phenolphthalein, on the other hand, exhibits a color change interval that
nicely brackets the abrupt change in pH occurring at the titration's equivalence point. A sharp color change from
colorless to pink will be observed within a very small volume interval around the equivalence point.

Summary
14.1 Brønsted-Lowry Acids and Bases
A compound that can donate a proton (a hydrogen ion) to another compound is called a Brønsted-Lowry acid. The
compound that accepts the proton is called a Brønsted-Lowry base. The species remaining after a Brønsted-Lowry
acid has lost a proton is the conjugate base of the acid. The species formed when a Brønsted-Lowry base gains a
proton is the conjugate acid of the base. Thus, an acid-base reaction occurs when a proton is transferred from an
acid to a base, with formation of the conjugate base of the reactant acid and formation of the conjugate acid of the
reactant base. Amphiprotic species can act as both proton donors and proton acceptors. Water is the most important
amphiprotic species. It can form both the hydronium ion, H3O+, and the hydroxide ion, OH− when it undergoes
autoionization:
2H2 O(l) ⇌ H3 O+(aq) + OH−(aq)
The ion product of water, Kw is the equilibrium constant for the autoionization reaction:
Chapter 14 | Acid-Base Equilibria 811
Kw = [H3 O+][OH−] = 1.0 × 10−14 at 25 °C
14.2 pH and pOH
Concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions in aqueous media are often represented as logarithmic pH and pOH
values, respectively. At 25 °C, the autoprotolysis equilibrium for water requires the sum of pH and pOH to equal 14
for any aqueous solution. The relative concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ion in a solution define its status
as acidic ([H3O+] > [OH−]), basic ([H3O+] < [OH−]), or neutral ([H3O+] = [OH−]). At 25 °C, a pH < 7 indicates an
acidic solution, a pH > 7 a basic solution, and a pH = 7 a neutral solution.
14.3 Relative Strengths of Acids and Bases
The relative strengths of acids and bases are reflected in the magnitudes of their ionization constants; the stronger
the acid or base, the larger its ionization constant. A reciprocal relation exists between the strengths of a conjugate
acid-base pair: the stronger the acid, the weaker its conjugate base. Water exerts a leveling effect on dissolved acids
or bases, reacting completely to generate its characteristic hydronium and hydroxide ions (the strongest acid and base
that may exist in water). The strengths of the binary acids increase from left to right across a period of the periodic
table (CH4 < NH3 < H2O < HF), and they increase down a group (HF < HCl < HBr < HI). The strengths of oxyacids
that contain the same central element increase as the oxidation number of the element increases (H2SO3 < H2SO4).
The strengths of oxyacids also increase as the electronegativity of the central element increases [H2SeO4 < H2SO4].
14.4 Hydrolysis of Salts
The ions composing salts may possess acidic or basic character, ionizing when dissolved in water to yield acidic or
basic solutions. Acidic cations are typically the conjugate partners of weak bases, and basic anions are the conjugate
partners of weak acids. Many metal ions bond to water molecules when dissolved to yield complex ions that may
function as acids.
14.5 Polyprotic Acids
An acid that contains more than one ionizable proton is a polyprotic acid. These acids undergo stepwise ionization
reactions involving the transfer of single protons. The ionization constants for polyprotic acids decrease with each
subsequent step; these decreases typically are large enough to permit simple equilibrium calculations that treat each
step separately.
14.6 Buffers
Solutions that contain appreciable amounts of a weak conjugate acid-base pair are called buffers. A buffered solution
will experience only slight changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. Addition of large amounts of
acid or base can exceed the buffer capacity, consuming most of one conjugate partner and preventing further buffering
action.
14.7 Acid-Base Titrations
The titration curve for an acid-base titration is typically a plot of pH versus volume of added titrant. These curves are
useful in selecting appropriate acid-base indicators that will permit accurate determinations of titration end points.

Figure 15.1 The mineral fluorite (CaF2) is formed when dissolved calcium and fluoride ions precipitate from
groundwater within the Earth’s crust. Note that pure fluorite is colorless, and that the color in this sample is due to the
presence of other metal ions in the crystal.
Chapter Outline
15.1 Precipitation and Dissolution
15.2 Lewis Acids and Bases
15.3 Coupled Equilibria
Introduction
The mineral fluorite, CaF2 Figure 15.1, is commonly used as a semiprecious stone in many types of jewelry because
of its striking appearance. Deposits of fluorite are formed through a process called hydrothermal precipitation in
which calcium and fluoride ions dissolved in groundwater combine to produce insoluble CaF2 in response to some
change in solution conditions. For example, a decrease in temperature may trigger fluorite precipitation if its solubility
is exceeded at the lower temperature. Because fluoride ion is a weak base, its solubility is also affected by solution
pH, and so geologic or other processes that change groundwater pH will also affect the precipitation of fluorite. This
chapter extends the equilibrium discussion of other chapters by addressing some additional reaction classes (including
precipitation) and systems involving coupled equilibrium reactions.
15.1 Precipitation and Dissolution
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Write chemical equations and equilibrium expressions representing solubility equilibria
• Carry out equilibrium computations involving solubility, equilibrium expressions, and solute concentrations
Chapter 15 | Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes 823
Solubility equilibria are established when the dissolution and precipitation of a solute species occur at equal rates.
These equilibria underlie many natural and technological processes, ranging from tooth decay to water purification.
An understanding of the factors affecting compound solubility is, therefore, essential to the effective management
of these processes. This section applies previously introduced equilibrium concepts and tools to systems involving
dissolution and precipitation.
The Solubility Product
Recall from the chapter on solutions that the solubility of a substance can vary from essentially zero (insoluble or
sparingly soluble) to infinity (miscible). A solute with finite solubility can yield a saturated solution when it is added
to a solvent in an amount exceeding its solubility, resulting in a heterogeneous mixture of the saturated solution and
the excess, undissolved solute. For example, a saturated solution of silver chloride is one in which the equilibrium
shown below has been established.
AgCl(s) ⇌
precipitation
dissolution Ag+(aq) + Cl−(aq)
In this solution, an excess of solid AgCl dissolves and dissociates to produce aqueous Ag+ and Cl– ions at the same
rate that these aqueous ions combine and precipitate to form solid AgCl (Figure 15.2). Because silver chloride is a
sparingly soluble salt, the equilibrium concentration of its dissolved ions in the solution is relatively low.
Figure 15.2 Silver chloride is a sparingly soluble ionic solid. When it is added to water, it dissolves slightly and
produces a mixture consisting of a very dilute solution of Ag+ and Cl– ions in equilibrium with undissolved silver
chloride.
The equilibrium constant for solubility equilibria such as this one is called the solubility product constant, Ksp, in
this case
AgCl(s) ⇌ Ag+(aq) + Cl−(aq) Ksp = [Ag+(aq)][Cl−(aq)]
Recall that only gases and solutes are represented in equilibrium constant expressions, so the Ksp does not include a
term for the undissolved AgCl. A listing of solubility product constants for several sparingly soluble compounds is
provided in Appendix J.

Writing Equations and Solubility Products

(d) Pb(OH)Cl(s) ⇌ Pb2+(aq) + OH−(aq) + Cl−(aq) Ksp = [Pb2+][OH−][Cl−]
Ksp and Solubility
The Ksp of a slightly soluble ionic compound may be simply related to its measured solubility provided the dissolution
process involves only dissociation and solvation, for example:
M p Xq(s) ⇌ pMm+(aq) + qXn−(aq)
For cases such as these, one may derive Ksp values from provided solubilities, or vice-versa. Calculations of this sort
are most conveniently performed using a compound’s molar solubility, measured as moles of dissolved solute per liter
of saturated solution.
Example 15.2
Calculation of Ksp from Equilibrium Concentrations
Fluorite, CaF2, is a slightly soluble solid that dissolves according to the equation:
CaF2(s) ⇌ Ca2+(aq) + 2F−(aq)
The concentration of Ca2+ in a saturated solution of CaF2 is 2.15 × 10–4 M. What is the solubility product
Chapter 15 | Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes 825
of fluorite?
Solution
According to the stoichiometry of the dissolution equation, the fluoride ion molarity of a CaF2 solution is
equal to twice its calcium ion molarity:
[F− ] = (2 mol F− / 1 mol Ca2 + ) = (2)(2.15 × 10−4 M) = 4.30 × 10−4 M
Substituting the ion concentrations into the Ksp expression gives
Ksp = [Ca2+][F−]2 = (2.15 × 10−4)(4.30 × 10−4)2 = 3.98 × 10−11

Determination of Molar Solubility from Ksp
The Ksp of copper(I) bromide, CuBr, is 6.3 × 10–9. Calculate the molar solubility of copper bromide.
Solution
The dissolution equation and solubility product expression are
CuBr(s) ⇌ Cu+(aq) + Br−(aq)
Ksp = [Cu+][Br−]
Following the ICE approach to this calculation yields the table
Substituting the equilibrium concentration terms into the solubility product expression and solving for x
yields
Ksp = [Cu+][Br−]
6.3 × 10−9 = (x)(x) = x2
x = (6.3 × 10−9) = 7.9 × 10−5 M
Since the dissolution stoichiometry shows one mole of copper(I) ion and one mole of bromide ion are

Determination of Molar Solubility from Ksp
The Ksp of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, is 1.3 × 10–6. Calculate the molar solubility of calcium hydroxide.
Solution
The dissolution equation and solubility product expression are
Ca(OH)2(s) ⇌ Ca2+(aq) + 2OH−(aq)
Ksp = [Ca2+][OH−]2
The ICE table for this system is
Substituting terms for the equilibrium concentrations into the solubility product expression and solving for
x gives
Ksp = [Ca2+][OH−]2
1.3 × 10−6 = (x)(2x)2 = (x)(4x2) = 4x3
x = 1.3 × 10−6

= 7.0 × 10−3 M
As defined in the ICE table, x is the molarity of calcium ion in the saturated solution. The dissolution
stoichiometry shows a 1:1 relation between moles of calcium ion in solution and moles of compound
dissolved, and so, the molar solubility of Ca(OH)2 is 6.9 × 10–3 M.

Determination of Ksp from Gram Solubility
Many of the pigments used by artists in oil-based paints (Figure 15.3) are sparingly soluble in water. For
example, the solubility of the artist’s pigment chrome yellow, PbCrO4, is 4.6 × 10–6 g/L. Determine the
solubility product for PbCrO4.
Chapter 15 | Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes 827
Figure 15.3 Oil paints contain pigments that are very slightly soluble in water. In addition to chrome yellow
(PbCrO4), examples include Prussian blue (Fe7(CN)18), the reddish-orange color vermilion (HgS), and
green color veridian (Cr2O3). (credit: Sonny Abesamis)
Solution
Before calculating the solubility product, the provided solubility must be converted to molarity:
⎡
⎣PbCrO4⎤
⎦ = 4.6 × 10−6 g PbCrO4
1 L × 1 mol PbCrO4
323.2 g PbCrO4
= 1.4 × 10−8 mol PbCrO4
1 L
= 1.4 × 10−8 M
The dissolution equation for this compound is
PbCrO4(s) ⇌ Pb2+(aq) + CrO4 2−(aq)
The dissolution stoichiometry shows a 1:1 relation between the molar amounts of compound and its two
ions, and so both [Pb2+] and [CrO4 2−] are equal to the molar solubility of PbCrO4:
[Pb2+] = [CrO4 2−] = 1.4 × 10−8 M
Ksp = [Pb2+] [CrO4 2−] = (1.4 × 10–8)(1.4 × 10–8) = 2.0 × 10–16

Calculating the Solubility of Hg2Cl2
Calomel, Hg2Cl2, is a compound composed of the diatomic ion of mercury(I), Hg2 2+, and chloride ions,
Cl–. Although most mercury compounds are now known to be poisonous, eighteenth-century physicians
used calomel as a medication. Their patients rarely suffered any mercury poisoning from the treatments

because calomel has a very low solubility, as suggested by its very small Ksp:
Hg2 Cl2(s) ⇌ Hg2 2+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq) Ksp = 1.1 × 10−18
Calculate the molar solubility of Hg2Cl2.
Solution
The dissolution stoichiometry shows a 1:1 relation between the amount of compound dissolved and the
amount of mercury(I) ions, and so the molar solubility of Hg2Cl2 is equal to the concentration of Hg2 2+
ions
Following the ICE approach results in
Substituting the equilibrium concentration terms into the solubility product expression and solving for x

Using Barium Sulfate for Medical Imaging
Various types of medical imaging techniques are used to aid diagnoses of illnesses in a noninvasive manner.
One such technique utilizes the ingestion of a barium compound before taking an X-ray image. A suspension of
barium sulfate, a chalky powder, is ingested by the patient. Since the Ksp of barium sulfate is 2.3 × 10–8, very
little of it dissolves as it coats the lining of the patient’s intestinal tract. Barium-coated areas of the digestive
tract then appear on an X-ray as white, allowing for greater visual detail than a traditional X-ray (Figure 15.4).

Predicting Precipitation
The equation that describes the equilibrium between solid calcium carbonate and its solvated ions is:
CaCO3(s) ⇌ Ca2+(aq) + CO3 2−(aq) Ksp = [Ca2 + ][CO3 2 − ] = 8.7 × 10−9
It is important to realize that this equilibrium is established in any aqueous solution containing Ca2+ and CO32– ions,
not just in a solution formed by saturating water with calcium carbonate. Consider, for example, mixing aqueous
solutions of the soluble compounds sodium carbonate and calcium nitrate. If the concentrations of calcium and
carbonate ions in the mixture do not yield a reaction quotient, Qsp, that exceeds the solubility product, Ksp, then no
precipitation will occur. If the ion concentrations yield a reaction quotient greater than the solubility product, then
precipitation will occur, lowering those concentrations until equilibrium is established (Qsp = Ksp). The comparison
of Qsp to Ksp to predict precipitation is an example of the general approach to predicting the direction of a reaction
first introduced in the chapter on equilibrium. For the specific case of solubility equilibria:
830 Chapter 15 | Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Qsp < Ksp: the reaction proceeds in the forward direction (solution is not saturated; no precipitation observed)
Qsp > Ksp: the reaction proceeds in the reverse direction (solution is supersaturated; precipitation will occur)
This predictive strategy and related calculations are demonstrated in the next few example exercises.
Example 15.7
Precipitation of Mg(OH)2
The first step in the preparation of magnesium metal is the precipitation of Mg(OH)2 from sea water by the
addition of lime, Ca(OH)2, a readily available inexpensive source of OH– ion:
Mg(OH)2(s) ⇌ Mg2+(aq) + 2OH−(aq) Ksp = 8.9 × 10−12
The concentration of Mg2+(aq) in sea water is 0.0537 M. Will Mg(OH)2 precipitate when enough Ca(OH)2
is added to give a [OH–] of 0.0010 M?
Solution
Calculation of the reaction quotient under these conditions is shown here:
Q = [Mg2+][OH−]2 = (0.0537)(0.0010)2 = 5.4 × 10−8
Because Q is greater than Ksp (Q = 5.4 × 10–8 is larger than Ksp = 8.9 × 10–12), the reverse reaction will
proceed, precipitating magnesium hydroxide until the dissolved ion concentrations have been sufficiently
lowered, so that Qsp = Ksp.

Precipitation of AgCl
Does silver chloride precipitate when equal volumes of a 2.0 × 10–4-M solution of AgNO3 and a 2.0 ×

Solution
The equation for the equilibrium between solid silver chloride, silver ion, and chloride ion is:
AgCl(s) ⇌ Ag+(aq) + Cl−(aq)
The solubility product is 1.6 × 10–10 (see Appendix J).
AgCl will precipitate if the reaction quotient calculated from the concentrations in the mixture of AgNO3
and NaCl is greater than Ksp. Because the volume doubles when equal volumes of AgNO3 and NaCl
solutions are mixed, each concentration is reduced to half its initial value
1
2(2.0 × 10−4) M = 1.0 × 10−4 M
The reaction quotient, Q, is greater than Ksp for AgCl, so a supersaturated solution is formed:
Q = [Ag+][Cl−] = (1.0 × 10−4)(1.0 × 10−4) = 1.0 × 10−8 > Ksp
AgCl will precipitate from the mixture until the dissolution equilibrium is established, with Q equal to Ksp.

Solution
The dissolution of Mn(OH)2 is described by the equation:
Mn(OH)2(s) ⇌ Mn2+(aq) + 2OH−(aq) Ksp = 2 × 10−13
At equilibrium:
Ksp = [Mn2+][OH−]2

Answer: 10.97
In solutions containing two or more ions that may form insoluble compounds with the same counter ion, an
experimental strategy called selective precipitation may be used to remove individual ions from solution. By
increasing the counter ion concentration in a controlled manner, ions in solution may be precipitated individually,
assuming their compound solubilities are adequately different. In solutions with equal concentrations of target ions,
Chapter 15 | Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes 833
the ion forming the least soluble compound will precipitate first (at the lowest concentration of counter ion), with the
other ions subsequently precipitating as their compound’s solubilities are reached. As an illustration of this technique,
the next example exercise describes separation of a two halide ions via precipitation of one as a silver salt.

The Role of Precipitation in Wastewater Treatment
Solubility equilibria are useful tools in the treatment of wastewater carried out in facilities that may treat the
municipal water in your city or town (Figure 15.6). Specifically, selective precipitation is used to remove
contaminants from wastewater before it is released back into natural bodies of water. For example, phosphate
ions (PO4 3−) are often present in the water discharged from manufacturing facilities. An abundance of
phosphate causes excess algae to grow, which impacts the amount of oxygen available for marine life as well
as making water unsuitable for human consumption.
Figure 15.6 Wastewater treatment facilities, such as this one, remove contaminants from wastewater before
the water is released back into the natural environment. (credit: “eutrophication&hypoxia”/Wikimedia
Commons)
One common way to remove phosphates from water is by the addition of calcium hydroxide, or lime, Ca(OH)2.
As the water is made more basic, the calcium ions react with phosphate ions to produce hydroxylapatite,
Ca5(PO4)3OH, which then precipitates out of the solution:
5Ca2+ + 3PO4 3− + OH− ⇌ Ca5 (PO4)3 ·OH(s)
Because the amount of calcium ion added does not result in exceeding the solubility products for other calcium
salts, the anions of those salts remain behind in the wastewater. The precipitate is then removed by filtration
and the water is brought back to a neutral pH by the addition of CO2 in a recarbonation process. Other
chemicals can also be used for the removal of phosphates by precipitation, including iron(III) chloride and
aluminum sulfate.

Precipitation of Silver Halides
A solution contains 0.00010 mol of KBr and 0.10 mol of KCl per liter. AgNO3 is gradually added to this
solution. Which forms first, solid AgBr or solid AgCl?
Chemistry in Everyday Life
Chapter 15 | Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes 835
Solution
The two equilibria involved are:
AgCl(s) ⇌ Ag+(aq) + Cl−(aq) Ksp = 1.6 × 10−10
AgBr(s) ⇌ Ag+(aq) + Br−(aq) Ksp = 5.0 × 10−13
If the solution contained about equal concentrations of Cl– and Br–, then the silver salt with the smaller
Ksp (AgBr) would precipitate first. The concentrations are not equal, however, so the [Ag+] at which AgCl
begins to precipitate and the [Ag+] at which AgBr begins to precipitate must be calculated. The salt that
forms at the lower [Ag+] precipitates first.
AgBr precipitates when Q equals Ksp for AgBr
Q = [Ag+][Br−] = [Ag+](0.00010) = 5.0 × 10−13
[Ag+] = 5.0 × 10−13
0.00010 = 5.0 × 10−9 M
AgI begins to precipitate when [Ag+] is 5.0 × 10–9 M.
For AgCl: AgCl precipitates when Q equals Ksp for AgCl (1.6 × 10–10). When [Cl–] = 0.10 M:
Qsp = [Ag+][Cl−] = [Ag+](0.10) = 1.6 × 10−10
[Ag+] = 1.6 × 10−10
0.10 = 1.6 × 10−9 M
AgCl begins to precipitate when [Ag+] is 1.6 × 10–9 M.
AgCl begins to precipitate at a lower [Ag+] than AgBr, so AgCl begins to precipitate first. Note the chloride
ion concentration of the initial mixture was significantly greater than the bromide ion concentration, and so
silver chloride precipitated first despite having a Ksp greater than that of silver bromide.

Common Ion Effect
Compared with pure water, the solubility of an ionic compound is less in aqueous solutions containing a common
ion (one also produced by dissolution of the ionic compound). This is an example of a phenomenon known as the
common ion effect, which is a consequence of the law of mass action that may be explained using Le ChÂtelier’s
principle. Consider the dissolution of silver iodide:
AgI(s) ⇌ Ag+(aq) + I−(aq)
This solubility equilibrium may be shifted left by the addition of either silver(I) or iodide ions, resulting in the
precipitation of AgI and lowered concentrations of dissolved Ag+ and I–. In solutions that already contain either of
these ions, less AgI may be dissolved than in solutions without these ions.
This effect may also be explained in terms of mass action as represented in the solubility product expression:
Ksp = [Ag+ ][I− ]
The mathematical product of silver(I) and iodide ion molarities is constant in an equilibrium mixture regardless of the
source of the ions, and so an increase in one ion’s concentration must be balanced by a proportional decrease in the
other.

(a) The reaction shifts to the left to relieve the stress produced by the additional Mg2+ ion, in accordance

the new equilibrium, [OH–] is less and [Mg2+] is greater than in the solution of Mg(OH)2 in pure water.
More solid Mg(OH)2 is present.

(a) Adding a common ion, Mg2+, will increase the concentration of this ion and shift the solubility
equilibrium to the left, decreasing the concentration of hydroxide ion and increasing the amount of

(b) Adding a common ion, OH–, will increase the concentration of this ion and shift the solubility
equilibrium to the left, decreasing the concentration of magnesium ion and increasing the amount of

15.2 Lewis Acids and Bases
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the Lewis model of acid-base chemistry
• Write equations for the formation of adducts and complex ions
• Perform equilibrium calculations involving formation constants
In 1923, G. N. Lewis proposed a generalized definition of acid-base behavior in which acids and bases are identified
by their ability to accept or to donate a pair of electrons and form a coordinate covalent bond.
A coordinate covalent bond (or dative bond) occurs when one of the atoms in the bond provides both bonding
electrons. For example, a coordinate covalent bond occurs when a water molecule combines with a hydrogen ion to
form a hydronium ion. A coordinate covalent bond also results when an ammonia molecule combines with a hydrogen
ion to form an ammonium ion. Both of these equations are shown here.
Reactions involving the formation of coordinate covalent bonds are classified as Lewis acid-base chemistry. The
species donating the electron pair that compose the bond is a Lewis base, the species accepting the electron pair is
a Lewis acid, and the product of the reaction is a Lewis acid-base adduct. As the two examples above illustrate,
Brønsted-Lowry acid-base reactions represent a subcategory of Lewis acid reactions, specifically, those in which the
acid species is H+. A few examples involving other Lewis acids and bases are described below.
The boron atom in boron trifluoride, BF3, has only six electrons in its valence shell. Being short of the preferred octet,
BF3 is a very good Lewis acid and reacts with many Lewis bases; a fluoride ion is the Lewis base in this reaction,
donating one of its lone pairs:
In the following reaction, each of two ammonia molecules, Lewis bases, donates a pair of electrons to a silver ion, the
Lewis acid:
Chapter 15 | Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes 839
Nonmetal oxides act as Lewis acids and react with oxide ions, Lewis bases, to form oxyanions:
Many Lewis acid-base reactions are displacement reactions in which one Lewis base displaces another Lewis base
from an acid-base adduct, or in which one Lewis acid displaces another Lewis acid:
Another type of Lewis acid-base chemistry involves the formation of a complex ion (or a coordination complex)
comprising a central atom, typically a transition metal cation, surrounded by ions or molecules called ligands. These
ligands can be neutral molecules like H2O or NH3, or ions such as CN– or OH–. Often, the ligands act as Lewis bases,
donating a pair of electrons to the central atom. These types of Lewis acid-base reactions are examples of a broad
subdiscipline called coordination chemistry—the topic of another chapter in this text.
The equilibrium constant for the reaction of a metal ion with one or more ligands to form a coordination complex is
called a formation constant (Kf) (sometimes called a stability constant). For example, the complex ion Cu(CN)2 −
is produced by the reaction
Cu+(aq) + 2CN−(aq) ⇌ Cu(CN)2 −(aq)
The formation constant for this reaction is
Kf = [Cu(CN)2 −]
[Cu+][CN−]2
Alternatively, the reverse reaction (decomposition of the complex ion) can be considered, in which case the
equilibrium constant is a dissociation constant (Kd). Per the relation between equilibrium constants for reciprocal
840 Chapter 15 | Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
reactions described, the dissociation constant is the mathematical inverse of the formation constant, Kd = Kf–1. A
tabulation of formation constants is provided in Appendix K.
As an example of dissolution by complex ion formation, let us consider what happens when we add aqueous ammonia
to a mixture of silver chloride and water. Silver chloride dissolves slightly in water, giving a small concentration of
Ag+ ([Ag+] = 1.3 × 10–5 M):
AgCl(s) ⇌ Ag+(aq) + Cl−(aq)
However, if NH3 is present in the water, the complex ion, Ag(NH3)2 +, can form according to the equation:
Example 15.14
Dissociation of a Complex Ion
Calculate the concentration of the silver ion in a solution that initially is 0.10 M with respect to
Ag(NH3)2 +.
Solution
Applying the standard ICE approach to this reaction yields the following:
Substituting these equilibrium concentration terms into the Kf expression gives
Kf = [Ag(NH3)2 +]
[Ag+][NH3]2
1.7 × 107 = 0.10 − x
(x)(2x)2
The very large equilibrium constant means the amount of the complex ion that will dissociate, x, will be
very small. Assuming x << 0.1 permits simplifying the above equation:
1.7 × 107 = 0.10
(x)(2x)2
x3 = 0.10
4(1.7 × 107) = 1.5 × 10−9
x = 1.5 × 10−9
3
= 1.1 × 10−3
Because only 1.1% of the Ag(NH3)2 + dissociates into Ag+ and NH3, the assumption that x is small is
justified.
Using this value of x and the relations in the above ICE table allows calculation of all species’ equilibrium
concentrations:
[Ag+] = 0 + x = 1.1 × 10−3 M
[NH3] = 0 + 2x = 2.2 × 10−3 M
[Ag(NH3)2 +] = 0.10 − x = 0.10 − 0.0011 = 0.099

15.3 Coupled Equilibria
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe examples of systems involving two (or more) coupled chemical equilibria
• Calculate reactant and product concentrations for coupled equilibrium systems
As discussed in preceding chapters on equilibrium, coupled equilibria involve two or more separate chemical
reactions that share one or more reactants or products. This section of this chapter will address solubility equilibria
coupled with acid-base and complex-formation reactions.
An environmentally relevant example illustrating the coupling of solubility and acid-base equilibria is the impact of
ocean acidification on the health of the ocean’s coral reefs. These reefs are built upon skeletons of sparingly soluble
calcium carbonate excreted by colonies of corals (small marine invertebrates). The relevant dissolution equilibrium is
CaCO3(s) ⇌ Ca2 + (aq) + CO3 −2 (aq) Ksp = 8.7 × 10−9
Rising concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide contribute to an increased acidity of ocean waters due to the
dissolution, hydrolysis, and acid ionization of carbon dioxide:
CO2(g) ⇌ CO2(aq)
CO2(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H2 CO3(aq)
H2 CO3(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ HCO3 − (aq) + H3 O+ (aq) Ka1 = 4.3 × 10−7
HCO3 − (aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ CO3 2 − (aq) + H3 O+ (aq) Ka2 = 4.7 × 10−11
Inspection of these equilibria shows the carbonate ion is involved in the calcium carbonate dissolution and the acid
hydrolysis of bicarbonate ion. Combining the dissolution equation with the reverse of the acid hydrolysis equation
yields
CaCO3(s) + H3 O+ (aq) ⇌ Ca2 + (aq) + HCO3 − (aq) + H2 O(l) K = Ksp / Ka2 = 180
The equilibrium constant for this net reaction is much greater than the Ksp for calcium carbonate, indicating its
solubility is markedly increased in acidic solutions. As rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere increase
the acidity of ocean waters, the calcium carbonate skeletons of coral reefs become more prone to dissolution and
subsequently less healthy (Figure 15.7).

The dramatic increase in solubility with increasing acidity described above for calcium carbonate is typical of salts
containing basic anions (e.g., carbonate, fluoride, hydroxide, sulfide). Another familiar example is the formation of
dental cavities in tooth enamel. The major mineral component of enamel is calcium hydroxyapatite (Figure 15.8), a
sparingly soluble ionic compound whose dissolution equilibrium is
Ca5(PO4)3 OH(s) ⇌ 5Ca2+(aq) + 3PO4 3−(aq) + OH−(aq)
Figure 15.8 Crystal of the mineral hydroxyapatite, Ca5(PO4)3OH, is shown here. The pure compound is white, but
like many other minerals, this sample is colored because of the presence of impurities.
This compound dissolved to yield two different basic ions: triprotic phosphate ions

PO4 3−(aq) + H3 O+(aq) ⟶ H2 PO4 2−(aq) + H2 O(l)
H2 PO4 2−(aq) + H3 O+(aq) ⟶ H2 PO4 −(aq) + H2 O(l)
H2 PO4 −(aq) + H3 O+(aq) ⟶ H3 PO4(aq) + H2 O(l)
and monoprotic hydroxide ions:
OH−(aq) + H3 O+ ⟶ 2H2 O
Of the two basic productions, the hydroxide is, of course, by far the stronger base (it’s the strongest base that can exist
in aqueous solution), and so it is the dominant factor providing the compound an acid-dependent solubility. Dental
cavities form when the acid waste of bacteria growing on the surface of teeth hastens the dissolution of tooth enamel
by reacting completely with the strong base hydroxide, shifting the hydroxyapatite solubility equilibrium to the right.
Some toothpastes and mouth rinses contain added NaF or SnF2 that make enamel more acid resistant by replacing the
strong base hydroxide with the weak base fluoride:
NaF + Ca5(PO4)3 OH ⇌ Ca5(PO4)3 F + Na+ + OH−
The weak base fluoride ion reacts only partially with the bacterial acid waste, resulting in a less extensive shift in the
solubility equilibrium and an increased resistance to acid dissolution. See the Chemistry in Everyday Life feature on
the role of fluoride in preventing tooth decay for more information.
Role of Fluoride in Preventing Tooth Decay
As we saw previously, fluoride ions help protect our teeth by reacting with hydroxylapatite to form fluorapatite,
Ca5(PO4)3F. Since it lacks a hydroxide ion, fluorapatite is more resistant to attacks by acids in our mouths
and is thus less soluble, protecting our teeth. Scientists discovered that naturally fluorinated water could be
beneficial to your teeth, and so it became common practice to add fluoride to drinking water. Toothpastes and
mouthwashes also contain amounts of fluoride (Figure 15.9).
Figure 15.9 Fluoride, found in many toothpastes, helps prevent tooth decay (credit: Kerry Ceszyk).
Unfortunately, excess fluoride can negate its advantages. Natural sources of drinking water in various parts
of the world have varying concentrations of fluoride, and places where that concentration is high are prone to
certain health risks when there is no other source of drinking water. The most serious side effect of excess
fluoride is the bone disease, skeletal fluorosis. When excess fluoride is in the body, it can cause the joints to
stiffen and the bones to thicken. It can severely impact mobility and can negatively affect the thyroid gland.
Skeletal fluorosis is a condition that over 2.7 million people suffer from across the world. So while fluoride can
protect our teeth from decay, the US Environmental Protection Agency sets a maximum level of 4 ppm (4 mg/
L) of fluoride in drinking water in the US. Fluoride levels in water are not regulated in all countries, so fluorosis
is a problem in areas with high levels of fluoride in the groundwater.
The solubility of ionic compounds may also be increased when dissolution is coupled to the formation of a complex

the formation of the complex ion Al(OH)4 −.
The equations for the dissolution of aluminum hydroxide, the formation of the complex ion, and the combined (net)
equation are shown below. As indicated by the relatively large value of K for the net reaction, coupling complex
formation with dissolution drastically increases the solubility of Al(OH)3.

Al(OH)3(s) ⇌ Al3+(aq) + 3OH−(aq) Ksp = 2 × 10−32
Al3+(aq) + 4OH−(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)4 −(aq) Kf = 1.1 × 1033
Net: Al(OH)3(s) + OH−(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)4 −(aq) K = Ksp Kf = 22

Increased Solubility in Acidic Solutions
Compute and compare the molar solublities for aluminum hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, dissolved in (a) pure water
and (b) a buffer containing 0.100 M acetic acid and 0.100 M sodium acetate.
Solution
(a) The molar solubility of calcium fluoride in water is computed considering the dissolution equilibrium
only as demonstrated in several previous examples:
Al(OH)3(s) ⇌ Al3 + (aq) + 3OH− (aq) Ksp = 2 × 10−32
molar solubility in water = [Al3 + ] = (2 × 10−32 / 27)1 / 3 = 9 × 10−12 M
(b) The concentration of hydroxide ion of the buffered solution is conveniently calculated by the Henderson-
Hasselbalch equation:
pH = pKa + log [CH3 COO− ] / [CH3 COOH]
pH = 4.74 + log (0.100 / 0.100) = 4.74
At this pH, the concentration of hydroxide ion is
pOH = 14.00 – 4.74 = 9.26
[OH− ] = 10−9.26 = 5.5 × 10−10
The solubility of Al(OH)3 in this buffer is then calculated from its solubility product expressions:
Ksp = [Al3 + ][OH− ]3
molar solubility in buffer = ⎡
⎣Al2 + ⎤
⎦ = Ksp / [OH− ]3 = (2 × 10−32) / (5.5 × 10−10)3 = 1.2 × 10−4 M
Compared to pure water, the solubility of aluminum hydroxide in this mildly acidic buffer is approximately
ten million times greater (though still relatively low).

What mass of Na2S2O3 is required to prepare 1.00 L of a solution that will dissolve 1.00 g of AgBr by the
formation of Ag(S2 O3)2 3− ?
Solution
Two equilibria are involved when AgBr dissolves in a solution containing the S2 O3 2− ion:
dissolution: AgBr(s) ⇌ Ag+(aq) + Br−(aq) Ksp = 5.0 × 10−13
complexation: Ag+(aq) + 2S2 O3 2−(aq) ⇌ Ag(S2 O3)2 3−(aq) Kf = 4.7 × 1013
First, calculate the concentration of bromide that will result when the 1.00 g of AgBr is completely dissolved
via the cited complexation reaction:
1.00 g AgBr / ⎛
⎝187.77 g/mol⎞
⎠⎛
⎝1 mol Br− / 1 mol AgBr⎞
⎠ = 0.00532 mol Br–
0.00521 mol Br− / 1.00 L = 0.00521 M Br−
Next, use this bromide molarity and the solubility product for silver bromide to calculate the silver ion
molarity in the solution:
[Ag+ ] = Ksp / [Br− ] = 5.0 × 10−13 / 0.00521 = 9.6 × 10−11 M
Based on the stoichiometry of the complex ion formation, the concentration of complex ion produced is
0.00521 – 9.6 × 10−11 = 0.00521 M
Use the silver ion and complex ion concentrations and the formation constant for the complex ion to
compute the concentration of thiosulfate ion.
[S2 O32− ]2 = [Ag(S2 O3)2]/[Ag+ ]Kf = 0.00521/(9.6 × 10−11)(4.7 × 1013) = 1.15 × 10−6
[S2 O32− ] = 1.1 × 10−3 M
Finally, use this molar concentration to derive the required mass of sodium thiosulfate:
(1.1 × 10−3 mol S2 O32− / L)(1 mol NaS2 O3 / 1 mol S2 O32− )(158.1 g NaS2 O3 / mol) = 1.7 g
Thus, 1.00 L of a solution prepared from 1.7 g Na2S2O3 dissolves 1.0 g of AgBr.

Summary
15.1 Precipitation and Dissolution
The equilibrium constant for an equilibrium involving the precipitation or dissolution of a slightly soluble ionic solid
is called the solubility product, Ksp, of the solid. For a heterogeneous equilibrium involving the slightly soluble solid
MpXq and its ions Mm+ and Xn–:
M p Xq(s) ⇌ pMm+(aq) + qXn−(aq)
the solubility product expression is:
Ksp = [Mm+] p [Xn−]q
The solubility product of a slightly soluble electrolyte can be calculated from its solubility; conversely, its solubility
can be calculated from its Ksp, provided the only significant reaction that occurs when the solid dissolves is the
formation of its ions.
848 Chapter 15 | Equilibria of Other Reaction Classes
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
A slightly soluble electrolyte begins to precipitate when the magnitude of the reaction quotient for the dissolution
reaction exceeds the magnitude of the solubility product. Precipitation continues until the reaction quotient equals the
solubility product.
15.2 Lewis Acids and Bases
A Lewis acid is a species that can accept an electron pair, whereas a Lewis base has an electron pair available for
donation to a Lewis acid. Complex ions are examples of Lewis acid-base adducts and comprise central metal atoms
or ions acting as Lewis acids bonded to molecules or ions called ligands that act as Lewis bases. The equilibrium
constant for the reaction between a metal ion and ligands produces a complex ion called a formation constant; for the
reverse reaction, it is called a dissociation constant.
15.3 Coupled Equilibria
Systems involving two or more chemical equilibria that share one or more reactant or product are called coupled
equilibria. Common examples of coupled equilibria include the increased solubility of some compounds in acidic
solutions (coupled dissolution and neutralization equilibria) and in solutions containing ligands (coupled dissolution
and complex formation). The equilibrium tools from other chapters may be applied to describe and perform
calculations on these systems.

48. The calcium ions in human blood serum are necessary for coagulation (Figure 15.5). Potassium oxalate,
K2C2O4, is used as an anticoagulant when a blood sample is drawn for laboratory tests because it removes the
calcium as a precipitate of CaC2O4·H2O. It is necessary to remove all but 1.0% of the Ca2+ in serum in order to
prevent coagulation. If normal blood serum with a buffered pH of 7.40 contains 9.5 mg of Ca2+ per 100 mL of
serum, what mass of K2C2O4 is required to prevent the coagulation of a 10 mL blood sample that is 55% serum by

sample is 5.5 mL. Assume that the Ksp value for CaC2O4 in serum is the same as in water.)

calculus begins to form?

Figure 16.1 Geysers are a dramatic display of thermodynamic principles in nature. Water deep within the
underground channels of the geyser is under high pressure and heated to high temperature by magma. When a
pocket of water near the surface reaches boiling point and is expelled, the resulting drop in pressure causes larger
volumes of water to flash boil, forcefully ejecting steam and water in an impressive eruption. (credit: modification of

Chapter Outline
16.1 Spontaneity
16.2 Entropy
16.3 The Second and Third Laws of Thermodynamics
16.4 Free Energy
Introduction
Among the many capabilities of chemistry is its ability to predict if a process will occur under specified conditions.
Thermodynamics, the study of relationships between the energy and work associated with chemical and physical
processes, provides this predictive ability. Previous chapters in this text have described various applications of
thermochemistry, an important aspect of thermodynamics concerned with the heat flow accompanying chemical
reactions and phase transitions. This chapter will introduce additional thermodynamic concepts, including those that
enable the prediction of any chemical or physical changes under a given set of conditions.
16.1 Spontaneity
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Distinguish between spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes
• Describe the dispersal of matter and energy that accompanies certain spontaneous processes
Processes have a natural tendency to occur in one direction under a given set of conditions. Water will naturally
Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics 861
flow downhill, but uphill flow requires outside intervention such as the use of a pump. Iron exposed to the earth’s
atmosphere will corrode, but rust is not converted to iron without intentional chemical treatment. A spontaneous
process is one that occurs naturally under certain conditions. A nonspontaneous process, on the other hand, will not
take place unless it is “driven” by the continual input of energy from an external source. A process that is spontaneous
in one direction under a particular set of conditions is nonspontaneous in the reverse direction. At room temperature
and typical atmospheric pressure, for example, ice will spontaneously melt, but water will not spontaneously freeze.
The spontaneity of a process is not correlated to the speed of the process. A spontaneous change may be so rapid
that it is essentially instantaneous or so slow that it cannot be observed over any practical period of time. To illustrate
this concept, consider the decay of radioactive isotopes, a topic more thoroughly treated in the chapter on nuclear
chemistry. Radioactive decay is by definition a spontaneous process in which the nuclei of unstable isotopes emit
radiation as they are converted to more stable nuclei. All the decay processes occur spontaneously, but the rates at
which different isotopes decay vary widely. Technetium-99m is a popular radioisotope for medical imaging studies
that undergoes relatively rapid decay and exhibits a half-life of about six hours. Uranium-238 is the most abundant
isotope of uranium, and its decay occurs much more slowly, exhibiting a half-life of more than four billion years
(Figure 16.2).
Figure 16.2 Both U-238 and Tc-99m undergo spontaneous radioactive decay, but at drastically different rates. Over
the course of one week, essentially all of a Tc-99m sample and none of a U-238 sample will have decayed.
As another example, consider the conversion of diamond into graphite (Figure 16.3).
C(s, diamond) ⟶ C(s, graphite)
The phase diagram for carbon indicates that graphite is the stable form of this element under ambient atmospheric
pressure, while diamond is the stable allotrope at very high pressures, such as those present during its geologic
formation. Thermodynamic calculations of the sort described in the last section of this chapter indicate that the
conversion of diamond to graphite at ambient pressure occurs spontaneously, yet diamonds are observed to exist,
and persist, under these conditions. Though the process is spontaneous under typical ambient conditions, its rate is
extremely slow; so, for all practical purposes diamonds are indeed “forever.” Situations such as these emphasize
the important distinction between the thermodynamic and the kinetic aspects of a process. In this particular case,
diamonds are said to be thermodynamically unstable but kinetically stable under ambient conditions.

Figure 16.3 The conversion of carbon from the diamond allotrope to the graphite allotrope is spontaneous at
ambient pressure, but its rate is immeasurably slow at low to moderate temperatures. This process is known as
graphitization, and its rate can be increased to easily measurable values at temperatures in the 1000–2000 K range.

Dispersal of Matter and Energy
Extending the discussion of thermodynamic concepts toward the objective of predicting spontaneity, consider now an
isolated system consisting of two flasks connected with a closed valve. Initially there is an ideal gas in one flask and
the other flask is empty (P = 0). (Figure 16.4). When the valve is opened, the gas spontaneously expands to fill both
flasks equally. Recalling the definition of pressure-volume work from the chapter on thermochemistry, note that no
work has been done because the pressure in a vacuum is zero.
w = −PΔV = 0 (P = 0 in a vaccum)
Note as well that since the system is isolated, no heat has been exchanged with the surroundings (q = 0). The first law
of thermodynamics confirms that there has been no change in the system’s internal energy as a result of this process.
ΔU = q + w = 0 + 0 = 0
The spontaneity of this process is therefore not a consequence of any change in energy that accompanies the
process. Instead, the driving force appears to be related to the greater, more uniform dispersal of matter that results
when the gas is allowed to expand. Initially, the system was comprised of one flask containing matter and another
flask containing nothing. After the spontaneous expansion took place, the matter was distributed both more widely
(occupying twice its original volume) and more uniformly (present in equal amounts in each flask).
Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics 863
Figure 16.4 An isolated system consists of an ideal gas in one flask that is connected by a closed valve to a second
flask containing a vacuum. Once the valve is opened, the gas spontaneously becomes evenly distributed between
the flasks.
Now consider two objects at different temperatures: object X at temperature TX and object Y at temperature TY, with
TX > TY (Figure 16.5). When these objects come into contact, heat spontaneously flows from the hotter object (X)
to the colder one (Y). This corresponds to a loss of thermal energy by X and a gain of thermal energy by Y.
qX < 0 and qY = −qX > 0
From the perspective of this two-object system, there was no net gain or loss of thermal energy, rather the available
thermal energy was redistributed among the two objects. This spontaneous process resulted in a more uniform
dispersal of energy.
Figure 16.5 When two objects at different temperatures come in contact, heat spontaneously flows from the hotter
to the colder object.
As illustrated by the two processes described, an important factor in determining the spontaneity of a process is the
extent to which it changes the dispersal or distribution of matter and/or energy. In each case, a spontaneous process
took place that resulted in a more uniform distribution of matter or energy.
Example 16.1
Redistribution of Matter during a Spontaneous Process
Describe how matter is redistributed when the following spontaneous processes take place:
(a) A solid sublimes.
(b) A gas condenses.
(c) A drop of food coloring added to a glass of water forms a solution with uniform color.

Solution
Figure 16.6 (credit a: modification of work by Jenny Downing; credit b: modification of work by “Fuzzy
Gerdes”/Flickr; credit c: modification of work by Paul A. Flowers)
(a) Sublimation is the conversion of a solid (relatively high density) to a gas (much lesser density). This
process yields a much greater dispersal of matter, since the molecules will occupy a much greater volume
after the solid-to-gas transition.
(b) Condensation is the conversion of a gas (relatively low density) to a liquid (much greater density). This
process yields a much lesser dispersal of matter, since the molecules will occupy a much lesser volume after
the gas-to-liquid transition.
(c) The process in question is diffusion. This process yields a more uniform dispersal of matter, since the
initial state of the system involves two regions of different dye concentrations (high in the drop of dye, zero
in the water), and the final state of the system contains a single dye concentration throughout.

Describe how energy is redistributed when a spoon at room temperature is placed in a cup of hot coffee.
Answer: Heat will spontaneously flow from the hotter object (coffee) to the colder object (spoon), resulting
in a more uniform distribution of thermal energy as the spoon warms and the coffee cools.
16.2 Entropy
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define entropy
• Explain the relationship between entropy and the number of microstates
• Predict the sign of the entropy change for chemical and physical processes
In 1824, at the age of 28, Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot (Figure 16.7) published the results of an extensive study
regarding the efficiency of steam heat engines. A later review of Carnot’s findings by Rudolf Clausius introduced a
new thermodynamic property that relates the spontaneous heat flow accompanying a process to the temperature at
which the process takes place. This new property was expressed as the ratio of the reversible heat (qrev) and the kelvin
temperature (T). In thermodynamics, a reversible process is one that takes place at such a slow rate that it is always
at equilibrium and its direction can be changed (it can be “reversed”) by an infinitesimally small change in some
condition. Note that the idea of a reversible process is a formalism required to support the development of various
thermodynamic concepts; no real processes are truly reversible, rather they are classified as irreversible.
Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics 865
Figure 16.7 (a) Nicholas Léonard Sadi Carnot’s research into steam-powered machinery and (b) Rudolf Clausius’s
later study of those findings led to groundbreaking discoveries about spontaneous heat flow processes.
Similar to other thermodynamic properties, this new quantity is a state function, so its change depends only upon the
initial and final states of a system. In 1865, Clausius named this property entropy (S) and defined its change for any
process as the following:
ΔS = qrev
T
The entropy change for a real, irreversible process is then equal to that for the theoretical reversible process that
involves the same initial and final states.
Entropy and Microstates
Following the work of Carnot and Clausius, Ludwig Boltzmann developed a molecular-scale statistical model that
related the entropy of a system to the number of microstates (W) possible for the system. A microstate is a specific
configuration of all the locations and energies of the atoms or molecules that make up a system. The relation between
a system’s entropy and the number of possible microstates is
S = k ln W
where k is the Boltzmann constant, 1.38 × 10−23 J/K.
As for other state functions, the change in entropy for a process is the difference between its final (Sf) and initial (Si)
values:
ΔS = Sf − Si = k ln Wf − k ln Wi = k ln Wf
Wi
For processes involving an increase in the number of microstates, Wf > Wi, the entropy of the system increases and
ΔS > 0. Conversely, processes that reduce the number of microstates, Wf < Wi, yield a decrease in system entropy,
ΔS < 0. This molecular-scale interpretation of entropy provides a link to the probability that a process will occur as
illustrated in the next paragraphs.
Consider the general case of a system comprised of N particles distributed among n boxes. The number of microstates
possible for such a system is nN. For example, distributing four particles among two boxes will result in 24

= 16 different microstates as illustrated in Figure 16.8. Microstates with equivalent particle arrangements (not
considering individual particle identities) are grouped together and are called distributions. The probability that a
system will exist with its components in a given distribution is proportional to the number of microstates within the
distribution. Since entropy increases logarithmically with the number of microstates, the most probable distribution
is therefore the one of greatest entropy.
Figure 16.8 The sixteen microstates associated with placing four particles in two boxes are shown. The microstates
are collected into five distributions—(a), (b), (c), (d), and (e)—based on the numbers of particles in each box.
For this system, the most probable configuration is one of the six microstates associated with distribution (c) where
the particles are evenly distributed between the boxes, that is, a configuration of two particles in each box. The
probability of finding the system in this configuration is 6
16 or 3
8. The least probable configuration of the system is
one in which all four particles are in one box, corresponding to distributions (a) and (e), each with a probability of 1
16.
The probability of finding all particles in only one box (either the left box or right box) is then ⎛
⎝ 1
16 + 1
16
⎞
⎠ = 2
16 or
1
8.
As you add more particles to the system, the number of possible microstates increases exponentially (2N). A
macroscopic (laboratory-sized) system would typically consist of moles of particles (N ~ 1023), and the corresponding
number of microstates would be staggeringly huge. Regardless of the number of particles in the system, however,
the distributions in which roughly equal numbers of particles are found in each box are always the most probable
configurations.
This matter dispersal model of entropy is often described qualitatively in terms of the disorder of the system. By
this description, microstates in which all the particles are in a single box are the most ordered, thus possessing the
least entropy. Microstates in which the particles are more evenly distributed among the boxes are more disordered,
possessing greater entropy.
The previous description of an ideal gas expanding into a vacuum (Figure 16.4) is a macroscopic example of this
particle-in-a-box model. For this system, the most probable distribution is confirmed to be the one in which the matter
is most uniformly dispersed or distributed between the two flasks. Initially, the gas molecules are confined to just
one of the two flasks. Opening the valve between the flasks increases the volume available to the gas molecules and,
correspondingly, the number of microstates possible for the system. Since Wf > Wi, the expansion process involves an
increase in entropy (ΔS > 0) and is spontaneous.
Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics 867
A similar approach may be used to describe the spontaneous flow of heat. Consider a system consisting of two objects,
each containing two particles, and two units of thermal energy (represented as “*”) in Figure 16.9. The hot object is
comprised of particles A and B and initially contains both energy units. The cold object is comprised of particles C
and D, which initially has no energy units. Distribution (a) shows the three microstates possible for the initial state of
the system, with both units of energy contained within the hot object. If one of the two energy units is transferred, the
result is distribution (b) consisting of four microstates. If both energy units are transferred, the result is distribution (c)
consisting of three microstates. Thus, we may describe this system by a total of ten microstates. The probability that
the heat does not flow when the two objects are brought into contact, that is, that the system remains in distribution
(a), is 3
10. More likely is the flow of heat to yield one of the other two distribution, the combined probability being
7
10. The most likely result is the flow of heat to yield the uniform dispersal of energy represented by distribution
(b), the probability of this configuration being 4
10. This supports the common observation that placing hot and cold
objects in contact results in spontaneous heat flow that ultimately equalizes the objects’ temperatures. And, again, this
spontaneous process is also characterized by an increase in system entropy.
Figure 16.9 This shows a microstate model describing the flow of heat from a hot object to a cold object. (a) Before
the heat flow occurs, the object comprised of particles A and B contains both units of energy and as represented by a
distribution of three microstates. (b) If the heat flow results in an even dispersal of energy (one energy unit
transferred), a distribution of four microstates results. (c) If both energy units are transferred, the resulting distribution
has three microstates.

The initial number of microstates is one, the final six:

Wa = 1.38 × 10−23 J/K × ln 6

state than for the initial state, the change in entropy should be positive.

energy is transferred from the hot object (AB) to the cold object (CD)?
Answer: 0 J/K
Predicting the Sign of ΔS
The relationships between entropy, microstates, and matter/energy dispersal described previously allow us to make
generalizations regarding the relative entropies of substances and to predict the sign of entropy changes for chemical
and physical processes. Consider the phase changes illustrated in Figure 16.10. In the solid phase, the atoms or
molecules are restricted to nearly fixed positions with respect to each other and are capable of only modest oscillations
about these positions. With essentially fixed locations for the system’s component particles, the number of microstates
is relatively small. In the liquid phase, the atoms or molecules are free to move over and around each other, though
they remain in relatively close proximity to one another. This increased freedom of motion results in a greater
variation in possible particle locations, so the number of microstates is correspondingly greater than for the solid. As
a result, Sliquid > Ssolid and the process of converting a substance from solid to liquid (melting) is characterized by an
increase in entropy, ΔS > 0. By the same logic, the reciprocal process (freezing) exhibits a decrease in entropy, ΔS <
0.
Figure 16.10 The entropy of a substance increases (ΔS > 0) as it transforms from a relatively ordered solid, to a
less-ordered liquid, and then to a still less-ordered gas. The entropy decreases (ΔS < 0) as the substance transforms
from a gas to a liquid and then to a solid.
Now consider the gaseous phase, in which a given number of atoms or molecules occupy a much greater volume than
in the liquid phase. Each atom or molecule can be found in many more locations, corresponding to a much greater
number of microstates. Consequently, for any substance, Sgas > Sliquid > Ssolid, and the processes of vaporization and
sublimation likewise involve increases in entropy, ΔS > 0. Likewise, the reciprocal phase transitions, condensation
and deposition, involve decreases in entropy, ΔS < 0.
According to kinetic-molecular theory, the temperature of a substance is proportional to the average kinetic energy of
its particles. Raising the temperature of a substance will result in more extensive vibrations of the particles in solids
and more rapid translations of the particles in liquids and gases. At higher temperatures, the distribution of kinetic
energies among the atoms or molecules of the substance is also broader (more dispersed) than at lower temperatures.
Thus, the entropy for any substance increases with temperature (Figure 16.11).
Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics 869
Figure 16.11 Entropy increases as the temperature of a substance is raised, which corresponds to the greater
spread of kinetic energies. When a substance undergoes a phase transition, its entropy changes significantly.
Try this simulator (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16freemotion) with interactive visualization of the
dependence of particle location and freedom of motion on physical state and temperature.
The entropy of a substance is influenced by the structure of the particles (atoms or molecules) that comprise the
substance. With regard to atomic substances, heavier atoms possess greater entropy at a given temperature than lighter
atoms, which is a consequence of the relation between a particle’s mass and the spacing of quantized translational
energy levels (a topic beyond the scope of this text). For molecules, greater numbers of atoms increase the number of
ways in which the molecules can vibrate and thus the number of possible microstates and the entropy of the system.
Finally, variations in the types of particles affects the entropy of a system. Compared to a pure substance, in which all
particles are identical, the entropy of a mixture of two or more different particle types is greater. This is because of
the additional orientations and interactions that are possible in a system comprised of nonidentical components. For
example, when a solid dissolves in a liquid, the particles of the solid experience both a greater freedom of motion and
additional interactions with the solvent particles. This corresponds to a more uniform dispersal of matter and energy
and a greater number of microstates. The process of dissolution therefore involves an increase in entropy, ΔS > 0.
Considering the various factors that affect entropy allows us to make informed predictions of the sign of ΔS for
various chemical and physical processes as illustrated in Example 16.3.

16.3 The Second and Third Laws of Thermodynamics
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• State and explain the second and third laws of thermodynamics
• Calculate entropy changes for phase transitions and chemical reactions under standard conditions
The Second Law of Thermodynamics
In the quest to identify a property that may reliably predict the spontaneity of a process, a promising candidate
has been identified: entropy. Processes that involve an increase in entropy of the system (ΔS > 0) are very often
spontaneous; however, examples to the contrary are plentiful. By expanding consideration of entropy changes to
include the surroundings, we may reach a significant conclusion regarding the relation between this property and
spontaneity. In thermodynamic models, the system and surroundings comprise everything, that is, the universe, and
so the following is true:
ΔSuniv = ΔSsys + ΔSsurr
To illustrate this relation, consider again the process of heat flow between two objects, one identified as the system
and the other as the surroundings. There are three possibilities for such a process:
1. The objects are at different temperatures, and heat flows from the hotter to the cooler object. This is always
observed to occur spontaneously. Designating the hotter object as the system and invoking the definition of
entropy yields the following:
ΔSsys = −qrev
Tsys and ΔSsurr = qrev
Tsurr
The magnitudes of −qrev and qrev are equal, their opposite arithmetic signs denoting loss of heat by the system
and gain of heat by the surroundings. Since Tsys > Tsurr in this scenario, the entropy decrease of the system
will be less than the entropy increase of the surroundings, and so the entropy of the universe will increase:
Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics 871
|ΔSsys| < |ΔSsurr|
ΔSuniv = ΔSsys + ΔSsurr > 0
2. The objects are at different temperatures, and heat flows from the cooler to the hotter object. This is never
observed to occur spontaneously. Again designating the hotter object as the system and invoking the definition
of entropy yields the following:
ΔSsys = qrev
Tsys and ΔSsurr = −qrev
Tsurr
The arithmetic signs of qrev denote the gain of heat by the system and the loss of heat by the surroundings.
The magnitude of the entropy change for the surroundings will again be greater than that for the system, but
in this case, the signs of the heat changes (that is, the direction of the heat flow) will yield a negative value for
ΔSuniv. This process involves a decrease in the entropy of the universe.
3. The objects are at essentially the same temperature, Tsys ≈ Tsurr, and so the magnitudes of the entropy changes
are essentially the same for both the system and the surroundings. In this case, the entropy change of the
universe is zero, and the system is at equilibrium.
|ΔSsys| ≈ |ΔSsurr|
ΔSuniv = ΔSsys + ΔSsurr = 0
These results lead to a profound statement regarding the relation between entropy and spontaneity known as the
second law of thermodynamics: all spontaneous changes cause an increase in the entropy of the universe. A
summary of these three relations is provided in Table 16.1.
The Second Law of Thermodynamics
ΔSuniv > 0 spontaneous
ΔSuniv < 0 nonspontaneous (spontaneous in opposite direction)
ΔSuniv = 0 at equilibrium
Table 16.1
For many realistic applications, the surroundings are vast in comparison to the system. In such cases, the heat gained
or lost by the surroundings as a result of some process represents a very small, nearly infinitesimal, fraction of its total
thermal energy. For example, combustion of a fuel in air involves transfer of heat from a system (the fuel and oxygen
molecules undergoing reaction) to surroundings that are infinitely more massive (the earth’s atmosphere). As a result,
qsurr is a good approximation of qrev, and the second law may be stated as the following:
ΔSuniv = ΔSsys + ΔSsurr = ΔSsys + qsurr
T
We may use this equation to predict the spontaneity of a process as illustrated in Example 16.4.
Example 16.4
Will Ice Spontaneously Melt?
The entropy change for the process
H2 O(s) ⟶ H2 O(l)
is 22.1 J/K and requires that the surroundings transfer 6.00 kJ of heat to the system. Is the process
spontaneous at −10.00 °C? Is it spontaneous at +10.00 °C?
872 Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Solution
We can assess the spontaneity of the process by calculating the entropy change of the universe. If ΔSuniv is
positive, then the process is spontaneous. At both temperatures, ΔSsys = 22.1 J/K and qsurr = −6.00 kJ.
At −10.00 °C (263.15 K), the following is true:
ΔSuniv = ΔSsys + ΔSsurr = ΔSsys + qsurr
T
= 22.1 J/K + −6.00 × 103 J
263.15 K = −0.7 J/K
Suniv < 0, so melting is nonspontaneous (not spontaneous) at −10.0 °C.
At 10.00 °C (283.15 K), the following is true:
ΔSuniv = ΔSsys + qsurr
T
= 22.1 J/K + −6.00 × 103 J
283.15 K = +0.9 J/K
Suniv > 0, so melting is spontaneous at 10.00 °C.

Using this information, determine if liquid water will spontaneously freeze at the same temperatures. What
can you say about the values of Suniv?
Answer: Entropy is a state function, so ΔSfreezing = −ΔSmelting = −22.1 J/K and qsurr = +6.00 kJ. At −10.00
°C spontaneous, +0.7 J/K; at +10.00 °C nonspontaneous, −0.9 J/K.
The Third Law of Thermodynamics
The previous section described the various contributions of matter and energy dispersal that contribute to the entropy
of a system. With these contributions in mind, consider the entropy of a pure, perfectly crystalline solid possessing no
kinetic energy (that is, at a temperature of absolute zero, 0 K). This system may be described by a single microstate, as
its purity, perfect crystallinity and complete lack of motion means there is but one possible location for each identical
atom or molecule comprising the crystal (W = 1). According to the Boltzmann equation, the entropy of this system is
zero.
S = k ln W = k ln(1) = 0
This limiting condition for a system’s entropy represents the third law of thermodynamics: the entropy of a pure,
perfect crystalline substance at 0 K is zero.
Careful calorimetric measurements can be made to determine the temperature dependence of a substance’s entropy
and to derive absolute entropy values under specific conditions. Standard entropies (S°) are for one mole of
substance under standard conditions (a pressure of 1 bar and a temperature of 298.15 K; see details regarding standard
conditions in the thermochemistry chapter of this text). The standard entropy change (ΔS°) for a reaction may be
computed using standard entropies as shown below:
ΔS° = ∑ νS°(products) − ∑ νS°(reactants)
where ν represents stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced equation representing the process. For example, ΔS°
for the following reaction at room temperature
mA + nB ⟶ xC + yD,
is computed as:

16.4 Free Energy
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define Gibbs free energy, and describe its relation to spontaneity
• Calculate free energy change for a process using free energies of formation for its reactants and products
• Calculate free energy change for a process using enthalpies of formation and the entropies for its reactants
and products
• Explain how temperature affects the spontaneity of some processes
• Relate standard free energy changes to equilibrium constants
One of the challenges of using the second law of thermodynamics to determine if a process is spontaneous is
that it requires measurements of the entropy change for the system and the entropy change for the surroundings.
An alternative approach involving a new thermodynamic property defined in terms of system properties only was
introduced in the late nineteenth century by American mathematician Josiah Willard Gibbs. This new property is
called the Gibbs free energy (G) (or simply the free energy), and it is defined in terms of a system’s enthalpy and
entropy as the following:
Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics 875
G = H − TS
Free energy is a state function, and at constant temperature and pressure, the free energy change (ΔG) may be
expressed as the following:
ΔG = ΔH − TΔS
(For simplicity’s sake, the subscript “sys” will be omitted henceforth.)
The relationship between this system property and the spontaneity of a process may be understood by recalling the
previously derived second law expression:
ΔSuniv = ΔS + qsurr
T
The first law requires that qsurr = −qsys, and at constant pressure qsys = ΔH, so this expression may be rewritten as:
ΔSuniv = ΔS − ΔH
T
Multiplying both sides of this equation by −T, and rearranging yields the following:
−TΔSuniv = ΔH − TΔS
Comparing this equation to the previous one for free energy change shows the following relation:
ΔG = −TΔSuniv
The free energy change is therefore a reliable indicator of the spontaneity of a process, being directly related to the
previously identified spontaneity indicator, ΔSuniv. Table 16.3 summarizes the relation between the spontaneity of a
process and the arithmetic signs of these indicators.
Relation between Process Spontaneity and Signs of Thermodynamic Properties
ΔSuniv > 0 ΔG < 0 spontaneous
ΔSuniv < 0 ΔG > 0 nonspontaneous
ΔSuniv = 0 ΔG = 0 at equilibrium
Table 16.3
What’s “Free” about ΔG?
In addition to indicating spontaneity, the free energy change also provides information regarding the amount of useful
work (w) that may be accomplished by a spontaneous process. Although a rigorous treatment of this subject is beyond
the scope of an introductory chemistry text, a brief discussion is helpful for gaining a better perspective on this
important thermodynamic property.
For this purpose, consider a spontaneous, exothermic process that involves a decrease in entropy. The free energy, as
defined by
ΔG = ΔH − TΔS
may be interpreted as representing the difference between the energy produced by the process, ΔH, and the energy lost
to the surroundings, TΔS. The difference between the energy produced and the energy lost is the energy available (or
“free”) to do useful work by the process, ΔG. If the process somehow could be made to take place under conditions
of thermodynamic reversibility, the amount of work that could be done would be maximal:
ΔG = wmax
However, as noted previously in this chapter, such conditions are not realistic. In addition, the technologies used to
extract work from a spontaneous process (e.g., automobile engine, steam turbine) are never 100% efficient, and so
the work done by these processes is always less than the theoretical maximum. Similar reasoning may be applied to a
nonspontaneous process, for which the free energy change represents the minimum amount of work that must be done

on the system to carry out the process.
Calculating Free Energy Change
Free energy is a state function, so its value depends only on the conditions of the initial and final states of the
system. A convenient and common approach to the calculation of free energy changes for physical and chemical
reactions is by use of widely available compilations of standard state thermodynamic data. One method involves the
use of standard enthalpies and entropies to compute standard free energy changes, ΔG°, according to the following
relation.
ΔG° = ΔH° − TΔS°
Example 16.7
Using Standard Enthalpy and Entropy Changes to Calculate ΔG°
Use standard enthalpy and entropy data from Appendix G to calculate the standard free energy change for
the vaporization of water at room temperature (298 K). What does the computed value for ΔG° say about
the spontaneity of this process?
Solution
The process of interest is the following:
H2 O(l) ⟶ H2 O(g)
The standard change in free energy may be calculated using the following equation:
ΔG° = ΔH° − TΔS°
From Appendix G:
Substance ΔHf° (kJ/mol) S°(J/K·mol)
H2O(l) −286.83 70.0
H2O(g) −241.82 188.8
Using the appendix data to calculate the standard enthalpy and entropy changes yields:
ΔH° = ΔHf° ⎛
⎝H2 O(g)⎞
⎠ − ΔHf° ⎛
⎝H2 O(l)⎞
⎠
= ⎡
⎣−241.82 kJ/mol − (−286.83)⎤
⎦ kJ/mol = 45.01 kJ
ΔS° = 1 mol × S°⎛
⎝H2 O(g)⎞
⎠ − 1 mol × S°⎛
⎝H2 O(l)⎞
⎠
= (1 mol)188.8 J/mol·K − (1 mol)70.0 J/mol K = 118.8 J/K
ΔG° = ΔH° − TΔS°
Substitution into the standard free energy equation yields:
ΔG° = ΔH° − TΔS°
= 45.01 kJ − (298 K × 118.8 J/K) × 1 kJ
1000 J
45.01 kJ − 35.4 kJ = 9.6 kJ
At 298 K (25 °C) ΔG° > 0, so boiling is nonspontaneous (not spontaneous).

process?
C2 H6(g) ⟶ H2(g) + C2 H4(g)
Answer: ΔG° = 102.0 kJ/mol; the reaction is nonspontaneous (not spontaneous) at 25 °C.
The standard free energy change for a reaction may also be calculated from standard free energy of formation ΔGf°
values of the reactants and products involved in the reaction. The standard free energy of formation is the free energy
change that accompanies the formation of one mole of a substance from its elements in their standard states. Similar
to the standard enthalpy of formation, ΔGf° is by definition zero for elemental substances under standard state
conditions. The approach used to calculate ΔG° for a reaction from ΔGf° values is the same as that demonstrated
previously for enthalpy and entropy changes. For the reaction
mA + nB ⟶ xC + yD,
the standard free energy change at room temperature may be calculated as
ΔG° = ∑ ν ΔG°(products) − ∑ ν ΔG°(reactants)
= ⎡

Free Energy Changes for Coupled Reactions
The use of free energies of formation to compute free energy changes for reactions as described above is possible
because ΔG is a state function, and the approach is analogous to the use of Hess’ Law in computing enthalpy changes
(see the chapter on thermochemistry). Consider the vaporization of water as an example:
H2 O⎛
⎝l⎞
⎠ → H2 O⎛
⎝g⎞
⎠
An equation representing this process may be derived by adding the formation reactions for the two phases of water
(necessarily reversing the reaction for the liquid phase). The free energy change for the sum reaction is the sum of
free energy changes for the two added reactions:
H2(g) + 1
2O2(g) → H2 O(g) ΔGf° gas
H2 O(l) → H2(g) + 1
2O2(g) − ΔGf° liquid
H2 O(l) → H2 O(g) ΔG ° = ΔGf° gas − ΔGf° liquid
This approach may also be used in cases where a nonspontaneous reaction is enabled by coupling it to a spontaneous
reaction. For example, the production of elemental zinc from zinc sulfide is thermodynamically unfavorable, as
indicated by a positive value for ΔG°:
ZnS(s) → Zn(s) + S(s) ΔG1° = 201.3 kJ
The industrial process for production of zinc from sulfidic ores involves coupling this decomposition reaction to the
thermodynamically favorable oxidation of sulfur:
S(s) + O2(g) → SO2(g) ΔG2° = −300.1 kJ
The coupled reaction exhibits a negative free energy change and is spontaneous:
ZnS(s) + O2(g) → Zn(s) + SO2(g) ΔG ° = 201.3 kJ + − 300.1 kJ = 98.8 kJ
This process is typically carried out at elevated temperatures, so this result obtained using standard free energy values
Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics 879
is just an estimate. The gist of the calculation, however, holds true.
Example 16.9
Calculating Free Energy Change for a Coupled Reaction
Is a reaction coupling the decomposition of ZnS to the formation of H2S expected to be spontaneous under
standard conditions?
Solution
Following the approach outlined above and using free energy values from Appendix G:
Decomposition of zinc sulfide: ZnS(s) → Zn(s) + S(s) ΔG1° = 201.3 kJ
Formation of hydrogen sulfide: S(s) + H2(g) → H2 S(g) ΔG2° = − 33.4 kJ
Coupled reaction: ZnS(s) + H2(g) → Zn(s) + H2 S(g) ΔG° = 201.3 kJ + − 33.4 kJ = 167.9 kJ
The coupled reaction exhibits a positive free energy change and is thus nonspontaneous.

Answer: −199.7 kJ; spontaneous
Temperature Dependence of Spontaneity
As was previously demonstrated in this chapter’s section on entropy, the spontaneity of a process may depend upon
the temperature of the system. Phase transitions, for example, will proceed spontaneously in one direction or the
other depending upon the temperature of the substance in question. Likewise, some chemical reactions can also
exhibit temperature dependent spontaneities. To illustrate this concept, the equation relating free energy change to the
enthalpy and entropy changes for the process is considered:
ΔG = ΔH − TΔS
The spontaneity of a process, as reflected in the arithmetic sign of its free energy change, is then determined by
the signs of the enthalpy and entropy changes and, in some cases, the absolute temperature. Since T is the absolute
(kelvin) temperature, it can only have positive values. Four possibilities therefore exist with regard to the signs of the
enthalpy and entropy changes:
1. Both ΔH and ΔS are positive. This condition describes an endothermic process that involves an increase
in system entropy. In this case, ΔG will be negative if the magnitude of the TΔS term is greater than ΔH. If
the TΔS term is less than ΔH, the free energy change will be positive. Such a process is spontaneous at high
temperatures and nonspontaneous at low temperatures.
2. Both ΔH and ΔS are negative. This condition describes an exothermic process that involves a decrease in
system entropy. In this case, ΔG will be negative if the magnitude of the TΔS term is less than ΔH. If the TΔS
term’s magnitude is greater than ΔH, the free energy change will be positive. Such a process is spontaneous
at low temperatures and nonspontaneous at high temperatures.
3. ΔH is positive and ΔS is negative. This condition describes an endothermic process that involves a decrease
in system entropy. In this case, ΔG will be positive regardless of the temperature. Such a process is
nonspontaneous at all temperatures.
4. ΔH is negative and ΔS is positive. This condition describes an exothermic process that involves an increase in
system entropy. In this case, ΔG will be negative regardless of the temperature. Such a process is spontaneous
at all temperatures.

These four scenarios are summarized in Figure 16.12.

Example 16.10
Predicting the Temperature Dependence of Spontaneity
The incomplete combustion of carbon is described by the following equation:
2C(s) + O2(g) ⟶ 2CO(g)
How does the spontaneity of this process depend upon temperature?
Solution
Combustion processes are exothermic (ΔH < 0). This particular reaction involves an increase in entropy due
to the accompanying increase in the amount of gaseous species (net gain of one mole of gas, ΔS > 0). The
reaction is therefore spontaneous (ΔG < 0) at all temperatures.

Popular chemical hand warmers generate heat by the air-oxidation of iron:
4Fe(s) + 3O2(g) ⟶ 2Fe2 O3(s)
How does the spontaneity of this process depend upon temperature?
Answer: ΔH and ΔS are negative; the reaction is spontaneous at low temperatures.
When considering the conclusions drawn regarding the temperature dependence of spontaneity, it is important to keep
in mind what the terms “high” and “low” mean. Since these terms are adjectives, the temperatures in question are
deemed high or low relative to some reference temperature. A process that is nonspontaneous at one temperature but
spontaneous at another will necessarily undergo a change in “spontaneity” (as reflected by its ΔG) as temperature
varies. This is clearly illustrated by a graphical presentation of the free energy change equation, in which ΔG is plotted
on the y axis versus T on the x axis:
ΔG = ΔH − TΔS
y = b + mx
Such a plot is shown in Figure 16.13. A process whose enthalpy and entropy changes are of the same arithmetic sign
will exhibit a temperature-dependent spontaneity as depicted by the two yellow lines in the plot. Each line crosses
from one spontaneity domain (positive or negative ΔG) to the other at a temperature that is characteristic of the
process in question. This temperature is represented by the x-intercept of the line, that is, the value of T for which ΔG
Chapter 16 | Thermodynamics 881
is zero:
ΔG = 0 = ΔH − TΔS
T = ΔH
ΔS
So, saying a process is spontaneous at “high” or “low” temperatures means the temperature is above or below,
respectively, that temperature at which ΔG for the process is zero. As noted earlier, the condition of ΔG = 0 describes
a system at equilibrium.
Figure 16.13 These plots show the variation in ΔG with temperature for the four possible combinations of arithmetic
sign for ΔH and ΔS.

Solution
The process of interest is the following phase change:
H2 O(l) ⟶ H2 O(g)
When this process is at equilibrium, ΔG = 0, so the following is true:

118.8 J/K = 370.5 K = 97.3 °C
The accepted value for water’s normal boiling point is 373.2 K (100.0 °C), and so this calculation is in
reasonable agreement. Note that the values for enthalpy and entropy changes data used were derived from
standard data at 298 K (Appendix G). If desired, you could obtain more accurate results by using enthalpy
and entropy changes determined at (or at least closer to) the actual boiling point.

Answer: 313 K (accepted value 319 K)
Free Energy and Equilibrium
The free energy change for a process may be viewed as a measure of its driving force. A negative value for ΔG
represents a driving force for the process in the forward direction, while a positive value represents a driving force
for the process in the reverse direction. When ΔG is zero, the forward and reverse driving forces are equal, and the
process occurs in both directions at the same rate (the system is at equilibrium).
In the chapter on equilibrium the reaction quotient, Q, was introduced as a convenient measure of the status of an
equilibrium system. Recall that Q is the numerical value of the mass action expression for the system, and that you
may use its value to identify the direction in which a reaction will proceed in order to achieve equilibrium. When Q is
lesser than the equilibrium constant, K, the reaction will proceed in the forward direction until equilibrium is reached
and Q = K. Conversely, if Q > K, the process will proceed in the reverse direction until equilibrium is achieved.
The free energy change for a process taking place with reactants and products present under nonstandard conditions
(pressures other than 1 bar; concentrations other than 1 M) is related to the standard free energy change according to
this equation:
ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln Q
R is the gas constant (8.314 J/K mol), T is the kelvin or absolute temperature, and Q is the reaction quotient. This
equation may be used to predict the spontaneity for a process under any given set of conditions as illustrated in
Example 16.12.

Answer: K = 6.9
To further illustrate the relation between these two essential thermodynamic concepts, consider the observation that
reactions spontaneously proceed in a direction that ultimately establishes equilibrium. As may be shown by plotting
the free energy change versus the extent of the reaction (for example, as reflected in the value of Q), equilibrium
is established when the system’s free energy is minimized (Figure 16.14). If a system consists of reactants and
products in nonequilibrium amounts (Q ≠ K), the reaction will proceed spontaneously in the direction necessary to
establish equilibrium.

Summary
16.1 Spontaneity
Chemical and physical processes have a natural tendency to occur in one direction under certain conditions. A
spontaneous process occurs without the need for a continual input of energy from some external source, while a
nonspontaneous process requires such. Systems undergoing a spontaneous process may or may not experience a gain
or loss of energy, but they will experience a change in the way matter and/or energy is distributed within the system.
16.2 Entropy
Entropy (S) is a state function that can be related to the number of microstates for a system (the number of ways the
system can be arranged) and to the ratio of reversible heat to kelvin temperature. It may be interpreted as a measure of
the dispersal or distribution of matter and/or energy in a system, and it is often described as representing the “disorder”
of the system.
For a given substance, entropy depends on phase with Ssolid < Sliquid < Sgas. For different substances in the same
physical state at a given temperature, entropy is typically greater for heavier atoms or more complex molecules.
Entropy increases when a system is heated and when solutions form. Using these guidelines, the sign of entropy
changes for some chemical reactions and physical changes may be reliably predicted.
16.3 The Second and Third Laws of Thermodynamics
The second law of thermodynamics states that a spontaneous process increases the entropy of the universe, Suniv >
0. If ΔSuniv < 0, the process is nonspontaneous, and if ΔSuniv = 0, the system is at equilibrium. The third law of
thermodynamics establishes the zero for entropy as that of a perfect, pure crystalline solid at 0 K. With only one
possible microstate, the entropy is zero. We may compute the standard entropy change for a process by using standard
entropy values for the reactants and products involved in the process.
16.4 Free Energy
Gibbs free energy (G) is a state function defined with regard to system quantities only and may be used to predict
the spontaneity of a process. A negative value for ΔG indicates a spontaneous process; a positive ΔG indicates a
nonspontaneous process; and a ΔG of zero indicates that the system is at equilibrium. A number of approaches to the
computation of free energy changes are possible.

Introduction
Another chapter in this text introduced the chemistry of reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions. This important reaction
class is defined by changes in oxidation states for one or more reactant elements, and it includes a subset of reactions
involving the transfer of electrons between reactant species. Around the turn of the nineteenth century, chemists began
exploring ways these electrons could be transferred indirectly via an external circuit rather than directly via intimate
contact of redox reactants. In the two centuries since, the field of electrochemistry has evolved to yield significant
insights on the fundamental aspects of redox chemistry as well as a wealth of technologies ranging from industrial-
scale metallurgical processes to robust, rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles (Figure 17.1). In this chapter, the
essential concepts of electrochemistry will be addressed.

17.1 Review of Redox Chemistry
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe defining traits of redox chemistry
• Identify the oxidant and reductant of a redox reaction
• Balance chemical equations for redox reactions using the half-reaction method
Since reactions involving electron transfer are essential to the topic of electrochemistry, a brief review of redox
chemistry is provided here that summarizes and extends the content of an earlier text chapter (see chapter on reaction
stoichiometry). Readers wishing additional review are referred to the text chapter on reaction stoichiometry.
Oxidation Numbers
By definition, a redox reaction is one that entails changes in oxidation number (or oxidation state) for one or more
of the elements involved. The oxidation number of an element in a compound is essentially an assessment of how
the electronic environment of its atoms is different in comparison to atoms of the pure element. By this description,
the oxidation number of an atom in an element is equal to zero. For an atom in a compound, the oxidation number is
equal to the charge the atom would have in the compound if the compound were ionic. Consequential to these rules,
the sum of oxidation numbers for all atoms in a molecule is equal to the charge on the molecule. To illustrate this
formalism, examples from the two compound classes, ionic and covalent, will be considered.
Simple ionic compounds present the simplest examples to illustrate this formalism, since by definition the elements’
oxidation numbers are numerically equivalent to ionic charges. Sodium chloride, NaCl, is comprised of Na+ cations
and Cl− anions, and so oxidation numbers for sodium and chlorine are, +1 and −1, respectively. Calcium fluoride,
CaF2, is comprised of Ca2+ cations and F− anions, and so oxidation numbers for calcium and fluorine are, +2 and −1,
respectively.
Covalent compounds require a more challenging use of the formalism. Water is a covalent compound whose
molecules consist of two H atoms bonded separately to a central O atom via polar covalent O−H bonds. The shared
electrons comprising an O−H bond are more strongly attracted to the more electronegative O atom, and so it acquires
a partial negative charge in the water molecule (relative to an O atom in elemental oxygen). Consequently, H atoms in
a water molecule exhibit partial positive charges compared to H atoms in elemental hydrogen. The sum of the partial
negative and partial positive charges for each water molecule is zero, and the water molecule is neutral.
Imagine that the polarization of shared electrons within the O−H bonds of water were 100% complete—the result
would be transfer of electrons from H to O, and water would be an ionic compound comprised of O2− anions and H+
cations. And so, the oxidations numbers for oxygen and hydrogen in water are −2 and +1, respectively. Applying this
same logic to carbon tetrachloride, CCl4, yields oxidation numbers of +4 for carbon and −1 for chlorine. In the nitrate
ion, NO 3
− , the oxidation number for nitrogen is +5 and that for oxygen is −2, summing to equal the 1− charge on
the molecule:
(1N atom)⎛
⎝ +5
N atom
⎞
⎠ + (3 O atoms)⎛
⎝ −2
O atom
⎞
⎠ = +5 + −6 = −1
Balancing Redox Equations
The unbalanced equation below describes the decomposition of molten sodium chloride:
NaCl(l) ⟶ Na(l) + Cl2(g) unbalanced
This reaction satisfies the criterion for redox classification, since the oxidation number for Na is decreased from +1
to 0 (it undergoes reduction) and that for Cl is increased from −1 to 0 (it undergoes oxidation). The equation in this
case is easily balanced by inspection, requiring stoichiometric coefficients of 2 for the NaCl and Na:

2NaCl(l) ⟶ 2Na(l) + Cl2(g) balanced
Redox reactions that take place in aqueous solutions are commonly encountered in electrochemistry, and many
involve water or its characteristic ions, H+(aq) and OH−(aq), as reactants or products. In these cases, equations
representing the redox reaction can be very challenging to balance by inspection, and the use of a systematic approach
called the half-reaction method is helpful. This approach involves the following steps:
1. Write skeletal equations for the oxidation and reduction half-reactions.
2. Balance each half-reaction for all elements except H and O.
3. Balance each half-reaction for O by adding H2O.
4. Balance each half-reaction for H by adding H+.
5. Balance each half-reaction for charge by adding electrons.
6. If necessary, multiply one or both half-reactions so that the number of electrons consumed in one is equal to
the number produced in the other.
7. Add the two half-reactions and simplify.
8. If the reaction takes place in a basic medium, add OH− ions the equation obtained in step 7 to neutralize the
H+ ions (add in equal numbers to both sides of the equation) and simplify.
The examples below demonstrate the application of this method to balancing equations for aqueous redox reactions.

17.2 Galvanic Cells
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the function of a galvanic cell and its components
• Use cell notation to symbolize the composition and construction of galvanic cells
As demonstration of spontaneous chemical change, Figure 17.2 shows the result of immersing a coiled wire of
copper into an aqueous solution of silver nitrate. A gradual but visually impressive change spontaneously occurs as
the initially colorless solution becomes increasingly blue, and the initially smooth copper wire becomes covered with
a porous gray solid.
Figure 17.2 A copper wire and an aqueous solution of silver nitrate (left) are brought into contact (center) and a
spontaneous transfer of electrons occurs, creating blue Cu2+(aq) and gray Ag(s) (right).
These observations are consistent with (i) the oxidation of elemental copper to yield copper(II) ions, Cu2+(aq), which
impart a blue color to the solution, and (ii) the reduction of silver(I) ions to yield elemental silver, which deposits as
a fluffy solid on the copper wire surface. And so, the direct transfer of electrons from the copper wire to the aqueous
silver ions is spontaneous under the employed conditions. A summary of this redox system is provided by these
equations:
Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry 901
overall reaction: Cu(s) + 2Ag+(aq) ⟶ Cu2 +(aq) + 2Ag(s)
oxidation half-reaction: Cu(s) ⟶ Cu2+(aq) + 2e−
reduction half-reaction: 2Ag+(aq) + 2e− ⟶ 2Ag(s)
Consider the construction of a device that contains all the reactants and products of a redox system like the one
here, but prevents physical contact between the reactants. Direct transfer of electrons is, therefore, prevented; transfer,
instead, takes place indirectly through an external circuit that contacts the separated reactants. Devices of this sort are
generally referred to as electrochemical cells, and those in which a spontaneous redox reaction takes place are called
galvanic cells (or voltaic cells).
A galvanic cell based on the spontaneous reaction between copper and silver(I) is depicted in Figure 17.3. The cell
is comprised of two half-cells, each containing the redox conjugate pair (“couple”) of a single reactant. The half-
cell shown at the left contains the Cu(0)/Cu(II) couple in the form of a solid copper foil and an aqueous solution of
copper nitrate. The right half-cell contains the Ag(I)/Ag(0) couple as solid silver foil and an aqueous silver nitrate
solution. An external circuit is connected to each half-cell at its solid foil, meaning the Cu and Ag foil each function
as an electrode. By definition, the anode of an electrochemical cell is the electrode at which oxidation occurs (in
this case, the Cu foil) and the cathode is the electrode where reduction occurs (the Ag foil). The redox reactions in
a galvanic cell occur only at the interface between each half-cell’s reaction mixture and its electrode. To keep the
reactants separate while maintaining charge-balance, the two half-cell solutions are connected by a tube filled with
inert electrolyte solution called a salt bridge. The spontaneous reaction in this cell produces Cu2+ cations in the anode
half-cell and consumes Ag+ ions in the cathode half-cell, resulting in a compensatory flow of inert ions from the salt
bridge that maintains charge balance. Increasing concentrations of Cu2+ in the anode half-cell are balanced by an
influx of NO3− from the salt bridge, while a flow of Na+ into the cathode half-cell compensates for the decreasing
Ag+ concentration.

Cell Notation
Abbreviated symbolism is commonly used to represent a galvanic cell by providing essential information on its
composition and structure. These symbolic representations are called cell notations or cell schematics, and they are
written following a few guidelines:
• The relevant components of each half-cell are represented by their chemical formulas or element symbols
• All interfaces between component phases are represented by vertical parallel lines; if two or more components
are present in the same phase, their formulas are separated by commas
• By convention, the schematic begins with the anode and proceeds left-to-right identifying phases and
interfaces encountered within the cell, ending with the cathode
A verbal description of the cell as viewed from anode-to-cathode is often a useful first-step in writing its schematic.
For example, the galvanic cell shown in Figure 17.3 consists of a solid copper anode immersed in an aqueous
solution of copper(II) nitrate that is connected via a salt bridge to an aqueous silver(I) nitrate solution, immersed in
which is a solid silver cathode. Converting this statement to symbolism following the above guidelines results in the
cell schematic:
Cu(s) │ 1 M Cu(NO3 )2(aq) ║ 1 M AgNO3(aq) │ Ag(s)
Consider a different galvanic cell (see Figure 17.4) based on the spontaneous reaction between solid magnesium
and aqueous iron(III) ions:
net cell reaction: Mg(s) + 2Fe3+(aq) ⟶ Mg2+(aq) + 2Fe2+(aq)
oxidation half-reaction: Mg(s) ⟶ Mg2+(aq) + 2e−
reduction half-reaction: 2Fe3+(aq) + 2e− ⟶ 2Fe2+(aq)
In this cell, a solid magnesium anode is immersed in an aqueous solution of magnesium chloride that is connected
via a salt bridge to an aqueous solution containing a mixture of iron(III) chloride and iron(II) chloride, immersed in
which is a platinum cathode. The cell schematic is then written as
Mg(s) │ 0.1 M MgCl2(aq) ║ 0.2 M FeCl3(aq), 0.3 M FeCl2(aq) │ Pt(s)
Notice the cathode half-cell is different from the others considered thus far in that its electrode is comprised of a
substance (Pt) that is neither a reactant nor a product of the cell reaction. This is required when neither member of
the half-cell’s redox couple can reasonably function as an electrode, which must be electrically conductive and in a
phase separate from the half-cell solution. In this case, both members of the redox couple are solute species, and so
Pt is used as an inert electrode that can simply provide or accept electrons to redox species in solution. Electrodes
constructed from a member of the redox couple, such as the Mg anode in this cell, are called active electrodes.

Example 17.3
Writing Galvanic Cell Schematics
A galvanic cell is fabricated by connecting two half-cells with a salt bridge, one in which a chromium wire is
immersed in a 1 M CrCl3 solution and another in which a copper wire is immersed in 1 M CuCl2. Assuming
the chromium wire functions as an anode, write the schematic for this cell along with equations for the
anode half-reaction, the cathode half-reaction, and the overall cell reaction.
Solution
Since the chromium wire is stipulated to be the anode, the schematic begins with it and proceeds left-to-
right, symbolizing the other cell components until ending with the copper wire cathode:
Cr(s) │ 1 M CrCl3(aq) ║ 1 M CuCl2(aq) │ Cu(s)
The half-reactions for this cell are
anode (oxidation): Cr(s) ⟶ Cr3+(aq) + 3e−
cathode (oxidation): Cu2+(aq) + 2e− ⟶ Cu(s)

17.3 Electrode and Cell Potentials
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe and relate the definitions of electrode and cell potentials
• Interpret electrode potentials in terms of relative oxidant and reductant strengths
• Calculate cell potentials and predict redox spontaneity using standard electrode potentials
Unlike the spontaneous oxidation of copper by aqueous silver(I) ions described in section 17.2, immersing a copper
wire in an aqueous solution of lead(II) ions yields no reaction. The two species, Ag+(aq) and Pb2+(aq), thus show a
distinct difference in their redox activity towards copper: the silver ion spontaneously oxidized copper, but the lead
ion did not. Electrochemical cells permit this relative redox activity to be quantified by an easily measured property,
potential. This property is more commonly called voltage when referenced in regard to electrical applications, and it
is a measure of energy accompanying the transfer of charge. Potentials are measured in the volt unit, defined as one
joule of energy per one coulomb of charge, V = J/C.
When measured for purposes of electrochemistry, a potential reflects the driving force for a specific type of charge
transfer process, namely, the transfer of electrons between redox reactants. Considering the nature of potential in this
context, it is clear that the potential of a single half-cell or a single electrode can’t be measured; “transfer” of electrons
requires both a donor and recipient, in this case a reductant and an oxidant, respectively. Instead, a half-cell potential
may only be assessed relative to that of another half-cell. It is only the difference in potential between two half-cells
that may be measured, and these measured potentials are called cell potentials, Ecell, defined as
Ecell = Ecathode − Eanode
where Ecathode and Eanode are the potentials of two different half-cells functioning as specified in the subscripts. As for
other thermodynamic quantities, the standard cell potential, E°cell, is a cell potential measured when both half-cells
are under standard-state conditions (1 M concentrations, 1 bar pressures, 298 K):
E° cell = E° cathode − E° anode
To simplify the collection and sharing of potential data for half-reactions, the scientific community has designated
one particular half-cell to serve as a universal reference for cell potential measurements, assigning it a potential of
exactly 0 V. This half-cell is the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) and it is based on half-reaction below:
2H+(aq) + 2e− ⟶ H2(g)
A typical SHE contains an inert platinum electrode immersed in precisely 1 M aqueous H+ and a stream of bubbling
H2 gas at 1 bar pressure, all maintained at a temperature of 298 K (see Figure 17.5).
Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry 905
Figure 17.5 A standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).
The assigned potential of the SHE permits the definition of a conveniently measured potential for a single half-cell.
The electrode potential (EX) for a half-cell X is defined as the potential measured for a cell comprised of X acting as
cathode and the SHE acting as anode:
Ecell = EX − ESHE
ESHE = 0 V (defined)
Ecell = EX
When the half-cell X is under standard-state conditions, its potential is the standard electrode potential, E°X. Since
the definition of cell potential requires the half-cells function as cathodes, these potentials are sometimes called
standard reduction potentials.
This approach to measuring electrode potentials is illustrated in Figure 17.6, which depicts a cell comprised of
an SHE connected to a copper(II)/copper(0) half-cell under standard-state conditions. A voltmeter in the external
circuit allows measurement of the potential difference between the two half-cells. Since the Cu half-cell is designated
as the cathode in the definition of cell potential, it is connected to the red (positive) input of the voltmeter, while
the designated SHE anode is connected to the black (negative) input. These connections insure that the sign of
the measured potential will be consistent with the sign conventions of electrochemistry per the various definitions
discussed above. A cell potential of +0.337 V is measured, and so
E° cell = E° Cu = +0.337 V
Tabulations of E° values for other half-cells measured in a similar fashion are available as reference literature to
permit calculations of cell potentials and the prediction of the spontaneity of redox processes.

Answer: −0. 47 V
Intrepreting Electrode and Cell Potentials
Thinking carefully about the definitions of cell and electrode potentials and the observations of spontaneous redox
change presented thus far, a significant relation is noted. The previous section described the spontaneous oxidation
of copper by aqueous silver(I) ions, but no observed reaction with aqueous lead(II) ions. Results of the calculations
in Example 17.4 have just shown the spontaneous process is described by a positive cell potential while the
nonspontaneous process exhibits a negative cell potential. And so, with regard to the relative effectiveness
(“strength”) with which aqueous Ag+ and Pb2+ ions oxidize Cu under standard conditions, the stronger oxidant is the
one exhibiting the greater standard electrode potential, E°. Since by convention electrode potentials are for reduction
processes, an increased value of E° corresponds to an increased driving force behind the reduction of the species
(hence increased effectiveness of its action as an oxidizing agent on some other species). Negative values for electrode
potentials are simply a consequence of assigning a value of 0 V to the SHE, indicating the reactant of the half-reaction
is a weaker oxidant than aqueous hydrogen ions.
Applying this logic to the numerically ordered listing of standard electrode potentials in Table 17.1 shows this listing
Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry 909
to be likewise in order of the oxidizing strength of the half-reaction’s reactant species, decreasing from strongest
oxidant (most positive E°) to weakest oxidant (most negative E°). Predictions regarding the spontaneity of redox
reactions under standard state conditions can then be easily made by simply comparing the relative positions of their
table entries. By definition, E°cell is positive when E°cathode > E°anode, and so any redox reaction in which the oxidant’s
entry is above the reductant’s entry is predicted to be spontaneous.
Reconsideration of the two redox reactions in Example 17.4 provides support for this fact. The entry for the
silver(I)/silver(0) half-reaction is above that for the copper(II)/copper(0) half-reaction, and so the oxidation of Cu by
Ag+ is predicted to be spontaneous (E°cathode > E°anode and so E°cell > 0). Conversely, the entry for the lead(II)/lead(0)
half-cell is beneath that for copper(II)/copper(0), and the oxidation of Cu by Pb2+ is nonspontaneous (E°cathode <
E°anode and so E°cell < 0).
Recalling the chapter on thermodynamics, the spontaneities of the forward and reverse reactions of a reversible
process show a reciprocal relationship: if a process is spontaneous in one direction, it is non-spontaneous in the
opposite direction. As an indicator of spontaneity for redox reactions, the potential of a cell reaction shows a
consequential relationship in its arithmetic sign. The spontaneous oxidation of copper by lead(II) ions is not observed,
Cu(s) + Pb2+(aq) ⟶ Cu2+(aq) + Pb(s)E° f orward = −0.47 V (negative, non-spontaneous)
and so the reverse reaction, the oxidation of lead by copper(II) ions, is predicted to occur spontaneously:
Pb(s) + Cu2+(aq) ⟶ Pb2+(aq) + Cu(s)E° f orward = +0.47 V (positive, spontaneous)
Note that reversing the direction of a redox reaction effectively interchanges the identities of the cathode and anode
half-reactions, and so the cell potential is calculated from electrode potentials in the reverse subtraction order than
that for the forward reaction. In practice, a voltmeter would report a potential of −0.47 V with its red and black inputs
connected to the Pb and Cu electrodes, respectively. If the inputs were swapped, the reported voltage would be +0.47
V.
Example 17.5
Predicting Redox Spontaneity
Are aqueous iron(II) ions predicted to spontaneously oxidize elemental chromium under standard state
conditions? Assume the half-reactions to be those available in Table 17.1.
Solution
Referring to the tabulated half-reactions, the redox reaction in question can be represented by the equations
below:
Cr(s) + Fe2+(aq) ⟶ Cr3+(aq) + Fe(s)
The entry for the putative oxidant, Fe2+, appears above the entry for the reductant, Cr, and so a spontaneous
reaction is predicted per the quick approach described above. Supporting this predication by calculating the
standard cell potential for this reaction gives
E° cell = E° cathode − E° anode
= E° Fe(II) − E° Cr
= −0.447 V − −0.774 V = +0.297 V
The positive value for the standard cell potential indicates the process is spontaneous under standard state
conditions.

17.4 Potential, Free Energy, and Equilibrium
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the relations between potential, free energy change, and equilibrium constants
• Perform calculations involving the relations between cell potentials, free energy changes, and equilibrium
• Use the Nernst equation to determine cell potentials under nonstandard conditions
So far in this chapter, the relationship between the cell potential and reaction spontaneity has been described,
suggesting a link to the free energy change for the reaction (see chapter on thermodynamics). The interpretation of
potentials as measures of oxidant strength was presented, bringing to mind similar measures of acid-base strength as
reflected in equilibrium constants (see the chapter on acid-base equilibria). This section provides a summary of the
relationships between potential and the related thermodynamic properties ΔG and K.
E° and ΔG°
The standard free energy change of a process, ΔG°, was defined in a previous chapter as the maximum work that could
be performed by a system, wmax. In the case of a redox reaction taking place within a galvanic cell under standard
state conditions, essentially all the work is associated with transferring the electrons from reductant-to-oxidant, welec:
ΔG° = wmax = welec
The work associated with transferring electrons is determined by the total amount of charge (coulombs) transferred
and the cell potential:
ΔG° = welec = −nFEcell
°
ΔG° = −nFEcell
°
where n is the number of moles of electrons transferred, F is Faraday’s constant, and E°cell is the standard cell
potential. The relation between free energy change and standard cell potential confirms the sign conventions and
spontaneity criteria previously discussed for both of these properties: spontaneous redox reactions exhibit positive
potentials and negative free energy changes.
E° and K
Combining a previously derived relation between ΔG° and K (see the chapter on thermodynamics) and the equation
above relating ΔG° and E°cell yields the following:
ΔG° = −RT ln K = −nFEcell
°
Ecell
° = ⎛
⎝RT
nF
⎞
⎠ ln K
This equation indicates redox reactions with large (positive) standard cell potentials will proceed far towards
completion, reaching equilibrium when the majority of reactant has been converted to product. A summary of the
relations between E°, ΔG° and K is depicted in Figure 17.7, and a table correlating reaction spontaneity to values of
these properties is provided in Table 17.2.

Potentials at Nonstandard Conditions: The Nernst Equation
Most of the redox processes that interest science and society do not occur under standard state conditions, and so the
potentials of these systems under nonstandard conditions are a property worthy of attention. Having established the
relationship between potential and free energy change in this section, the previously discussed relation between free
energy change and reaction mixture composition can be used for this purpose.
ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln Q
Notice the reaction quotient, Q, appears in this equation, making the free energy change dependent upon the
composition of the reaction mixture. Substituting the equation relating free energy change to cell potential yields the
Nernst equation:
−nFEcell = −nFEcell° + RT ln Q
Ecell = Ecell° − RT
nF ln Q
This equation describes how the potential of a redox system (such as a galvanic cell) varies from its standard state
value, specifically, showing it to be a function of the number of electrons transferred, n, the temperature, T, and the
reaction mixture composition as reflected in Q. A convenient form of the Nernst equation for most work is one in
which values for the fundamental constants (R and F) and a factor converting from natural to base-10 logarithms have
been included:
Ecell = −Ecell° − 0.0592V

Ecell° = Ecathode° − Eanode° = −0.447 V − (−0.28 V) = −0.17 V
Notice the negative value of the standard cell potential indicates the process is not spontaneous under
standard conditions. Substitution of the Nernst equation terms for the nonstandard conditions yields:
Q = [Co2+]
[Fe2+] = 0.15 M

Ecell = −0.17 V − 0.0592 V
2 log 0.077
Ecell = −0.17 V + 0.033 V = −0.014 V
The cell potential remains negative (slightly) under the specified conditions, and so the reaction remains
nonspontaneous.

A concentration cell is constructed by connecting two nearly identical half-cells, each based on the same half-
reaction and using the same electrode, varying only in the concentration of one redox species. The potential of a
concentration cell, therefore, is determined only by the difference in concentration of the chosen redox species. The
example problem below illustrates the use of the Nernst equation in calculations involving concentration cells.

Concentration Cells
What is the cell potential of the concentration cell described by

Solution
From the information given:
Anode: Zn(s) ⟶ Zn2+(aq, 0.10 M) + 2e− Eanode° = −0.7618 V
Cathode: Zn2+(aq, 0.50 M) + 2e− ⟶ Zn(s) Ecathode° = −0.7618 V
Overall: Zn2+(aq, 0.50 M) ⟶ Zn2+(aq, 0.10 M) Ecell° = 0.000 V
Substituting into the Nernst equation,
Ecell = 0.000 V − 0.0592 V
2 log 0.10
0.50 = +0.021 V
The positive value for cell potential indicates the overall cell reaction (see above) is spontaneous. This
spontaneous reaction is one in which the zinc ion concentration in the cathode falls (it is reduced to

17.5 Batteries and Fuel Cells
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the electrochemistry associated with several common batteries
• Distinguish the operation of a fuel cell from that of a battery
There are many technological products associated with the past two centuries of electrochemistry research, none more
immediately obvious than the battery. A battery is a galvanic cell that has been specially designed and constructed in
a way that best suits its intended use a source of electrical power for specific applications. Among the first successful
batteries was the Daniell cell, which relied on the spontaneous oxidation of zinc by copper(II) ions (Figure 17.8):
Zn(s) + Cu2 + (aq) ⟶ Zn2 + (aq) + Cu(s)

depicting the electrochemistry of the cell (right). The 1904 design used a porous clay pot to both contain one of the
half-cell’s content and to serve as a salt bridge to the other half-cell.
Modern batteries exist in a multitude of forms to accommodate various applications, from tiny button batteries
that provide the modest power needs of a wristwatch to the very large batteries used to supply backup energy to
municipal power grids. Some batteries are designed for single-use applications and cannot be recharged (primary
cells), while others are based on conveniently reversible cell reactions that allow recharging by an external power

source (secondary cells). This section will provide a summary of the basic electrochemical aspects of several batteries
familiar to most consumers, and will introduce a related electrochemical device called a fuel cell that can offer
improved performance in certain applications.
Visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16batteries) to learn more about batteries.
Single-Use Batteries
A common primary battery is the dry cell, which uses a zinc can as both container and anode (“–” terminal) and a
graphite rod as the cathode (“+” terminal). The Zn can is filled with an electrolyte paste containing manganese(IV)
oxide, zinc(II) chloride, ammonium chloride, and water. A graphite rod is immersed in the electrolyte paste to
complete the cell. The spontaneous cell reaction involves the oxidation of zinc:
anode reaction: Zn(s) ⟶ Zn2+(aq) + 2e−
and the reduction of manganese(IV)
reduction reaction: 2MnO2(s) + 2NH4 Cl(aq) + 2 e− ⟶ Mn2 O3(s) + 2NH3(aq) + H2 O(l) + 2Cl−
which together yield the cell reaction:
cell reaction: 2MnO2(s) + 2NH4 Cl(aq) + Zn(s) ⟶ Zn2+(aq) + Mn2 O3(s) + 2NH3(aq) + H2 O(l) + 2Cl− Ecell ~ 1.5 V
The voltage (cell potential) of a dry cell is approximately 1.5 V. Dry cells are available in various sizes (e.g., D, C,
AA, AAA). All sizes of dry cells comprise the same components, and so they exhibit the same voltage, but larger
cells contain greater amounts of the redox reactants and therefore are capable of transferring correspondingly greater
amounts of charge. Like other galvanic cells, dry cells may be connected in series to yield batteries with greater
voltage outputs, if needed.

Figure 17.9 A schematic diagram shows a typical dry cell.
Visit this site (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16zinccarbon) to learn more about zinc-carbon batteries.
Alkaline batteries (Figure 17.10) were developed in the 1950s to improve on the performance of the dry cell,
and they were designed around the same redox couples. As their name suggests, these types of batteries use alkaline
electrolytes, often potassium hydroxide. The reactions are
anode: Zn(s) + 2OH−(aq) ⟶ ZnO(s) + H2 O(l) + 2e−
cathode: 2MnO2(s) + H2 O(l) + 2e− ⟶ Mn2 O3(s) + 2OH−(aq)
cell: Zn(s) + 2MnO2(s) ⟶ ZnO(s) + Mn2 O3(s) Ecell = +1.43 V
An alkaline battery can deliver about three to five times the energy of a zinc-carbon dry cell of similar size. Alkaline
batteries are prone to leaking potassium hydroxide, so they should be removed from devices for long-term storage.
While some alkaline batteries are rechargeable, most are not. Attempts to recharge an alkaline battery that is not
rechargeable often leads to rupture of the battery and leakage of the potassium hydroxide electrolyte.

Rechargeable (Secondary) Batteries
Nickel-cadmium, or NiCd, batteries (Figure 17.11) consist of a nickel-plated cathode, cadmium-plated anode, and a
potassium hydroxide electrode. The positive and negative plates, which are prevented from shorting by the separator,
are rolled together and put into the case. This is a “jelly-roll” design and allows the NiCd cell to deliver much more
current than a similar-sized alkaline battery. The reactions are
anode: Cd(s) + 2OH−(aq) ⟶ Cd(OH)2(s) + 2e−
cathode: NiO2(s) + 2H2 O(l) + 2e− ⟶ Ni(OH)2(s) + 2OH−(aq)
cell: Cd(s) + NiO2(s) + 2H2 O(l) ⟶ Cd(OH)2(s) + Ni(OH)2(s) Ecell ~ 1.2 V
When properly treated, a NiCd battery can be recharged about 1000 times. Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal so NiCd
batteries should never be ruptured or incinerated, and they should be disposed of in accordance with relevant toxic
waste guidelines.

Lithium ion batteries (Figure 17.12) are among the most popular rechargeable batteries and are used in many
portable electronic devices. The reactions are
anode: LiCoO2 ⇌ Li1−x CoO2 + x Li+ + x e−
cathode: x Li+ + x e− + x C6 ⇌ x LiC6
cell: LiCoO2 + x C6 ⇌ Li1−x CoO2 + x LiC6 Ecell ~ 3.7 V
The variable stoichiometry of the cell reaction leads to variation in cell voltages, but for typical conditions, x is usually
no more than 0.5 and the cell voltage is approximately 3.7 V. Lithium batteries are popular because they can provide
a large amount current, are lighter than comparable batteries of other types, produce a nearly constant voltage as they
discharge, and only slowly lose their charge when stored.

The lead acid battery (Figure 17.13) is the type of secondary battery commonly used in automobiles. It is
inexpensive and capable of producing the high current required by automobile starter motors. The reactions for a lead
acid battery are
anode: Pb(s) + HSO4 −(aq) ⟶ PbSO4(s) + H+(aq) + 2e−
cathode: PbO2(s) + HSO4 −(aq) + 3H+(aq) + 2e− ⟶ PbSO4(s) + 2H2 O(l)
cell: Pb(s) + PbO2(s) + 2H2 SO4(aq) ⟶ 2PbSO4(s) + 2H2 O(l) Ecell ~ 2 V
Each cell produces 2 V, so six cells are connected in series to produce a 12-V car battery. Lead acid batteries are
heavy and contain a caustic liquid electrolyte, H2SO4(aq), but are often still the battery of choice because of their high
current density. Since these batteries contain a significant amount of lead, they must always be disposed of properly.

Fuel Cells
A fuel cell is a galvanic cell that uses traditional combustive fuels, most often hydrogen or methane, that are
continuously fed into the cell along with an oxidant. (An alternative, but not very popular, name for a fuel cell is a
flow battery.) Within the cell, fuel and oxidant undergo the same redox chemistry as when they are combusted, but
via a catalyzed electrochemical that is significantly more efficient. For example, a typical hydrogen fuel cell uses
graphite electrodes embedded with platinum-based catalysts to accelerate the two half-cell reactions:

Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry 921

Anode: 2H2(g) ⟶ 4H+(aq) + 4e−

Cell: 2H2(g) + O2(g) ⟶ 2H2 O(g) Ecell ~ 1.2 V
These types of fuel cells generally produce voltages of approximately 1.2 V. Compared to an internal combustion
engine, the energy efficiency of a fuel cell using the same redox reaction is typically more than double (~20%–25%
for an engine versus ~50%–75% for a fuel cell). Hydrogen fuel cells are commonly used on extended space missions,
and prototypes for personal vehicles have been developed, though the technology remains relatively immature.

17.6 Corrosion
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Define corrosion
• List some of the methods used to prevent or slow corrosion
Corrosion is usually defined as the degradation of metals by a naturally occurring electrochemical process. The
formation of rust on iron, tarnish on silver, and the blue-green patina that develops on copper are all examples of
corrosion. The total cost of corrosion remediation in the United States is significant, with estimates in excess of half
a trillion dollars a year.

Statue of Liberty: Changing Colors
The Statue of Liberty is a landmark every American recognizes. The Statue of Liberty is easily identified by its
height, stance, and unique blue-green color (Figure 17.15). When this statue was first delivered from France,
its appearance was not green. It was brown, the color of its copper “skin.” So how did the Statue of Liberty
change colors? The change in appearance was a direct result of corrosion. The copper that is the primary
component of the statue slowly underwent oxidation from the air. The oxidation-reduction reactions of copper
metal in the environment occur in several steps. Copper metal is oxidized to copper(I) oxide (Cu2O), which is
red, and then to copper(II) oxide, which is black
2Cu(s) + 1
2O2(g) ⟶ Cu2 O(s) (red)
Cu2 O(s) + 1
2 O2(g) ⟶ 2CuO(s) (black)
Coal, which was often high in sulfur, was burned extensively in the early part of the last century. As a result,
atmospheric sulfur trioxide, carbon dioxide, and water all reacted with the CuO
2CuO(s) + CO2(g) + H2 O(l) ⟶ Cu2 CO3 (OH)2(s) (green)
3CuO(s) + 2CO2(g) + H2 O(l) ⟶ Cu2 (CO3)2 (OH)2(s) (blue)
4CuO(s) + SO3(g) + 3H2 O(l) ⟶ Cu4 SO4 (OH)6(s) (green)
These three compounds are responsible for the characteristic blue-green patina seen on the Statue of Liberty
(and other outdoor copper structures). Fortunately, formation of patina creates a protective layer on the copper
surface, preventing further corrosion of the underlying copper. The formation of the protective layer is called
passivation, a phenomenon discussed further in another chapter of this text.
Figure 17.15 (a) The Statue of Liberty is covered with a copper skin, and was originally brown, as shown in
this painting. (b) Exposure to the elements has resulted in the formation of the blue-green patina seen today.
Perhaps the most familiar example of corrosion is the formation of rust on iron. Iron will rust when it is exposed to
oxygen and water. Rust formation involves the creation of a galvanic cell at an iron surface, as illustrated in Figure
Chemistry in Everyday Life
Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry 923
17.15. The relevant redox reactions are described by the following equations:
anode: Fe(s) ⟶ Fe2+(aq) + 2e− EFe2+ /Fe
° = −0.44 V
cathode: O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e− ⟶ 2H2 O(l) EO2 /O2° = +1.23 V
overall: 2Fe(s) + O2(g) + 4H+(aq) ⟶ 2Fe2+(aq) + 2H2 O(l) Ecell° = +1.67 V
Further reaction of the iron(II) product in humid air results in the production of an iron(III) oxide hydrate known as
rust:
4Fe2+(aq) + O2(g) + (4 + 2x) H2 O(l) ⟶ 2Fe2 O3 ·xH2 O(s) + 8H+(aq)
The stoichiometry of the hydrate varies, as indicated by the use of x in the compound formula. Unlike the patina on
copper, the formation of rust does not create a protective layer and so corrosion of the iron continues as the rust flakes
off and exposes fresh iron to the atmosphere.
Figure 17.16 Corrosion can occur when a painted iron or steel surface is exposed to the environment by a scratch
through the paint. A galvanic cell results that may be approximated by the simplified cell schematic Fe(s) | Fe2+(aq)
||O2(aq), H2O(l) | Fe(s).
One way to keep iron from corroding is to keep it painted. The layer of paint prevents the water and oxygen necessary
for rust formation from coming into contact with the iron. As long as the paint remains intact, the iron is protected
from corrosion.
Other strategies include alloying the iron with other metals. For example, stainless steel is an alloy of iron containing a
small amount of chromium. The chromium tends to collect near the surface, where it corrodes and forms a passivating
an oxide layer that protects the iron.
Iron and other metals may also be protected from corrosion by galvanization, a process in which the metal to be
protected is coated with a layer of a more readily oxidized metal, usually zinc. When the zinc layer is intact, it prevents
air from contacting the underlying iron and thus prevents corrosion. If the zinc layer is breached by either corrosion
or mechanical abrasion, the iron may still be protected from corrosion by a cathodic protection process, which is
described in the next paragraph.
Another important way to protect metal is to make it the cathode in a galvanic cell. This is cathodic protection and
can be used for metals other than just iron. For example, the rusting of underground iron storage tanks and pipes
can be prevented or greatly reduced by connecting them to a more active metal such as zinc or magnesium (Figure
17.17). This is also used to protect the metal parts in water heaters. The more active metals (lower reduction potential)
are called sacrificial anodes because as they get used up as they corrode (oxidize) at the anode. The metal being
924 Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
protected serves as the cathode for the reduction of oxygen in air, and so it simply serves to conduct (not react with)
the electrons being transferred. When the anodes are properly monitored and periodically replaced, the useful lifetime
of the iron storage tank can be greatly extended.
Figure 17.17 Cathodic protection is a useful approach to electrochemically preventing corrosion of underground
storage tanks.
17.7 Electrolysis
By the end of this section you will be able to:
• Describe the process of electrolysis
• Compare the operation of electrolytic cells with that of galvanic cells
• Perform stoichiometric calculations for electrolytic processes
Electrochemical cells in which spontaneous redox reactions take place (galvanic cells) have been the topic of
discussion so far in this chapter. In these cells, electrical work is done by a redox system on its surroundings
as electrons produced by the redox reaction are transferred through an external circuit. This final section of the
chapter will address an alternative scenario in which an external circuit does work on a redox system by imposing a
voltage sufficient to drive an otherwise nonspontaneous reaction, a process known as electrolysis. A familiar example
of electrolysis is recharging a battery, which involves use of an external power source to drive the spontaneous
(discharge) cell reaction in the reverse direction, restoring to some extent the composition of the half-cells and
the voltage of the battery. Perhaps less familiar is the use of electrolysis in the refinement of metallic ores, the
manufacture of commodity chemicals, and the electroplating of metallic coatings on various products (e.g., jewelry,
utensils, auto parts). To illustrate the essential concepts of electrolysis, a few specific processes will be considered.
The Electrolysis of Molten Sodium Chloride
Metallic sodium, Na, and chlorine gas, Cl2, are used in numerous applications, and their industrial production relies
on the large-scale electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, NaCl(l). The industrial process typically uses a Downs cell
similar to the simplified illustration shown in Figure 17.18. The reactions associated with this process are:
Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry 925
anode: 2Cl−(l) ⟶ Cl2(g) + 2e−
cathode: Na+(l) + e− ⟶ Na(l)
cell: 2Na+(l) + 2Cl−(l) ⟶ 2Na(l) + Cl2(g)
The cell potential for the above process is negative, indicating the reaction as written (decomposition of liquid NaCl)
is not spontaneous. To force this reaction, a positive potential of magnitude greater than the negative cell potential
must be applied to the cell.
Figure 17.18 Cells of this sort (a cell for the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride) are used in the Downs process
for production of sodium and chlorine, and they typically use iron cathodes and carbon anodes.
The Electrolysis of Water
Water may be electrolytically decomposed in a cell similar to the one illustrated in Figure 17.19. To improve
electrical conductivity without introducing a different redox species, the hydrogen ion concentration of the water is
typically increased by addition of a strong acid. The redox processes associated with this cell are
anode: 2H2 O(l) ⟶ O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e− Eanode° = +1.229 V
cathode: 2H+(aq) + 2e− ⟶ H2(g) Ecathode° = 0 V
cell: 2H2 O(l) ⟶ 2H2(g) + O2(g) Ecell° = −1.229 V
Again, the cell potential as written is negative, indicating a nonspontaneous cell reaction that must be driven by
imposing a cell voltage greater than +1.229 V. Keep in mind that standard electrode potentials are used to inform
thermodynamic predictions here, though the cell is not operating under standard state conditions. Therefore, at best,
calculated cell potentials should be considered ballpark estimates.

Figure 17.19 The electrolysis of water produces stoichiometric amounts of oxygen gas at the anode and hydrogen
at the anode.
The Electrolysis of Aqueous Sodium Chloride
When aqueous solutions of ionic compounds are electrolyzed, the anode and cathode half-reactions may involve the
electrolysis of either water species (H2O, H+, OH-) or solute species (the cations and anions of the compound). As an
example, the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride could involve either of these two anode reactions:
(i) 2Cl−(aq) ⟶ Cl2(g) + 2 e− Eanode° = +1.35827 V
(ii) 2H2 O(l) ⟶ O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e− Eanode° = +1.229 V
The standard electrode (reduction) potentials of these two half-reactions indicate water may be oxidized at a less
negative/more positive potential (–1.229 V) than chloride ion (–1.358 V). Thermodynamics thus predicts that water
would be more readily oxidized, though in practice it is observed that both water and chloride ion are oxidized under
typical conditions, producing a mixture of oxygen and chlorine gas.
Turning attention to the cathode, the possibilities for reduction are:
Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry 927
(iii) 2H+(aq) + 2e− ⟶ H2(g) Ecathode° = 0 V
(iv) 2H2 O(l) + 2e− ⟶ H2(g) + 2OH−(aq) Ecathode° = −0.8277 V
(v) Na+(aq) + e− ⟶ Na(s) Ecathode° = −2.71 V
Comparison of these standard half-reaction potentials suggests the reduction of hydrogen ion is thermodynamically
favored. However, in a neutral aqueous sodium chloride solution, the concentration of hydrogen ion is far below the
standard state value of 1 M (approximately 10-7 M), and so the observed cathode reaction is actually reduction of
water. The net cell reaction in this case is then
cell: 2H2 O(l) + 2Cl−(aq) ⟶ H2(g) + Cl2(g) + 2OH−(aq) Ecell° = −2.186 V
This electrolysis reaction is part of the chlor-alkali process used by industry to produce chlorine and sodium
hydroxide (lye).
Electroplating
An important use for electrolytic cells is in electroplating. Electroplating results in a thin coating of one metal
on top of a conducting surface. Reasons for electroplating include making the object more corrosion resistant,
strengthening the surface, producing a more attractive finish, or for purifying metal. The metals commonly used
in electroplating include cadmium, chromium, copper, gold, nickel, silver, and tin. Common consumer products
include silver-plated or gold-plated tableware, chrome-plated automobile parts, and jewelry. The silver plating
of eating utensils is used here to illustrate the process. (Figure 17.20).
Figure 17.20 This schematic shows an electrolytic cell for silver plating eating utensils.
In the figure, the anode consists of a silver electrode, shown on the left. The cathode is located on the right
and is the spoon, which is made from inexpensive metal. Both electrodes are immersed in a solution of silver
nitrate. Applying a sufficient potential results in the oxidation of the silver anode
anode: Ag(s) ⟶ Ag+(aq) + e−
and reduction of silver ion at the (spoon) cathode:
cathode: Ag+(aq) + e− ⟶ Ag(s)
The net result is the transfer of silver metal from the anode to the cathode. Several experimental factors must

be carefully controlled to obtain high-quality silver coatings, including the exact composition of the electrolyte
solution, the cell voltage applied, and the rate of the electrolysis reaction (electrical current).
Quantitative Aspects of Electrolysis
Electrical current is defined as the rate of flow for any charged species. Most relevant to this discussion is the flow
of electrons. Current is measured in a composite unit called an ampere, defined as one coulomb per second (A = 1 C/
s). The charge transferred, Q, by passage of a constant current, I, over a specified time interval, t, is then given by the
simple mathematical product
Q = It
When electrons are transferred during a redox process, the stoichiometry of the reaction may be used to derive the
total amount of (electronic) charge involved. For example, the generic reduction process
Mn+(aq) + ne− ⟶ M(s)
involves the transfer of n mole of electrons. The charge transferred is, therefore,
Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry 929
Q = nF
where F is Faraday’s constant, the charge in coulombs for one mole of electrons. If the reaction takes place in
an electrochemical cell, the current flow is conveniently measured, and it may be used to assist in stoichiometric
calculations related to the cell reaction.
Example 17.9
Converting Current to Moles of Electrons
In one process used for electroplating silver, a current of 10.23 A was passed through an electrolytic cell for
exactly 1 hour. How many moles of electrons passed through the cell? What mass of silver was deposited at
the cathode from the silver nitrate solution?
Solution
Faraday’s constant can be used to convert the charge (Q) into moles of electrons (n). The charge is the
current (I) multiplied by the time
n = Q
F =

From the problem, the solution contains AgNO3, so the reaction at the cathode involves 1 mole of electrons
for each mole of silver
cathode: Ag+(aq) + e− ⟶ Ag(s)
The atomic mass of silver is 107.9 g/mol, so
mass Ag = 0.3817 mol e− × 1 mol Ag

Time Required for Deposition
In one application, a 0.010-mm layer of chromium must be deposited on a part with a total surface area of
3.3 m2 from a solution of containing chromium(III) ions. How long would it take to deposit the layer of
chromium if the current was 33.46 A? The density of chromium (metal) is 7.19 g/cm3.

First, compute the volume of chromium that must be produced (equal to the product of surface area and
thickness):
volume = ⎛

10 mm
⎞
⎠ × ⎛
⎝3.3 m2 × ⎛
⎝10,000 cm2

The stoichiometry of the chromium(III) reduction process requires three moles of electrons for each mole
of chromium(0) produced, and so the total charge required is:
Q = 4.56 mol Cr × 3 mol e−
1 mol Cr × 96485 C
mol e− = 1.32 × 106 C
Finally, if this charge is passed at a rate of 33.46 C/s, the required time is:
t = Q
I = 1.32 × 106 C
33.46 C/s = 3.95 × 104 s = 11.0 hr

Summary
17.1 Review of Redox Chemistry
Redox reactions are defined by changes in reactant oxidation numbers, and those most relevant to electrochemistry
involve actual transfer of electrons. Aqueous phase redox processes often involve water or its characteristic ions,
H+ and OH−, as reactants in addition to the oxidant and reductant, and equations representing these reactions can be
challenging to balance. The half-reaction method is a systematic approach to balancing such equations that involves
separate treatment of the oxidation and reduction half-reactions.
17.2 Galvanic Cells
Galvanic cells are devices in which a spontaneous redox reaction occurs indirectly, with the oxidant and reductant
redox couples contained in separate half-cells. Electrons are transferred from the reductant (in the anode half-cell) to
Chapter 17 | Electrochemistry 933
the oxidant (in the cathode half-cell) through an external circuit, and inert solution phase ions are transferred between
half-cells, through a salt bridge, to maintain charge neutrality. The construction and composition of a galvanic cell
may be succinctly represented using chemical formulas and others symbols in the form of a cell schematic (cell
notation).
17.3 Electrode and Cell Potentials
The property of potential, E, is the energy associated with the separation/transfer of charge. In electrochemistry,
the potentials of cells and half-cells are thermodynamic quantities that reflect the driving force or the spontaneity
of their redox processes. The cell potential of an electrochemical cell is the difference in between its cathode and
anode. To permit easy sharing of half-cell potential data, the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is assigned a
potential of exactly 0 V and used to define a single electrode potential for any given half-cell. The electrode potential
of a half-cell, EX, is the cell potential of said half-cell acting as a cathode when connected to a SHE acting as
an anode. When the half-cell is operating under standard state conditions, its potential is the standard electrode
potential, E°X. Standard electrode potentials reflect the relative oxidizing strength of the half-reaction’s reactant, with
stronger oxidants exhibiting larger (more positive) E°X values. Tabulations of standard electrode potentials may be
used to compute standard cell potentials, E°cell, for many redox reactions. The arithmetic sign of a cell potential
indicates the spontaneity of the cell reaction, with positive values for spontaneous reactions and negative values for
nonspontaneous reactions (spontaneous in the reverse direction).
17.4 Potential, Free Energy, and Equilibrium
Potential is a thermodynamic quantity reflecting the intrinsic driving force of a redox process, and it is directly
related to the free energy change and equilibrium constant for the process. For redox processes taking place
in electrochemical cells, the maximum (electrical) work done by the system is easily computed from the cell
potential and the reaction stoichiometry and is equal to the free energy change for the process. The equilibrium
constant for a redox reaction is logarithmically related to the reaction’s cell potential, with larger (more positive)
potentials indicating reactions with greater driving force that equilibrate when the reaction has proceeded far towards
completion (large value of K). Finally, the potential of a redox process varies with the composition of the reaction
mixture, being related to the reactions standard potential and the value of its reaction quotient, Q, as described by the
Nernst equation.
17.5 Batteries and Fuel Cells
Galvanic cells designed specifically to function as electrical power supplies are called batteries. A variety of both
single-use batteries (primary cells) and rechargeable batteries (secondary cells) are commercially available to serve
a variety of applications, with important specifications including voltage, size, and lifetime. Fuel cells, sometimes
called flow batteries, are devices that harness the energy of spontaneous redox reactions normally associated with
combustion processes. Like batteries, fuel cells enable the reaction’s electron transfer via an external circuit, but they
require continuous input of the redox reactants (fuel and oxidant) from an external reservoir. Fuel cells are typically
much more efficient in converting the energy released by the reaction to useful work in comparison to internal
combustion engines.
17.6 Corrosion
Spontaneous oxidation of metals by natural electrochemical processes is called corrosion, familiar examples including
the rusting of iron and the tarnishing of silver. Corrosion process involve the creation of a galvanic cell in which
different sites on the metal object function as anode and cathode, with the corrosion taking place at the anodic site.
Approaches to preventing corrosion of metals include use of a protective coating of zinc (galvanization) and the use
of sacrificial anodes connected to the metal object (cathodic protection).
17.7 Electrolysis
Nonspontaneous redox processes may be forced to occur in electrochemical cells by the application of an appropriate
potential using an external power source—a process known as electrolysis. Electrolysis is the basis for certain ore
refining processes, the industrial production of many chemical commodities, and the electroplating of metal coatings

Introduction
The development of the periodic table in the mid-1800s came from observations that there was a periodic relationship
between the properties of the elements. Chemists, who have an understanding of the variations of these properties,
have been able to use this knowledge to solve a wide variety of technical challenges. For example, silicon and other
semiconductors form the backbone of modern electronics because of our ability to fine-tune the electrical properties
of these materials. This chapter explores important properties of representative metals, metalloids, and nonmetals in
the periodic table.
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 941
18.1 Periodicity
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Classify elements
• Make predictions about the periodicity properties of the representative elements
We begin this section by examining the behaviors of representative metals in relation to their positions in the periodic
table. The primary focus of this section will be the application of periodicity to the representative metals.
It is possible to divide elements into groups according to their electron configurations. The representative elements
are elements where the s and p orbitals are filling. The transition elements are elements where the d orbitals (groups
3–11 on the periodic table) are filling, and the inner transition metals are the elements where the f orbitals are filling.
The d orbitals fill with the elements in group 11; therefore, the elements in group 12 qualify as representative elements
because the last electron enters an s orbital. Metals among the representative elements are the representative metals.
Metallic character results from an element’s ability to lose its outer valence electrons and results in high thermal
and electrical conductivity, among other physical and chemical properties. There are 20 nonradioactive representative
metals in groups 1, 2, 3, 12, 13, 14, and 15 of the periodic table (the elements shaded in yellow in Figure 18.2). The
radioactive elements copernicium, flerovium, polonium, and livermorium are also metals but are beyond the scope of
this chapter.
In addition to the representative metals, some of the representative elements are metalloids. A metalloid is an element
that has properties that are between those of metals and nonmetals; these elements are typically semiconductors.
The remaining representative elements are nonmetals. Unlike metals, which typically form cations and ionic
compounds (containing ionic bonds), nonmetals tend to form anions or molecular compounds. In general, the
combination of a metal and a nonmetal produces a salt. A salt is an ionic compound consisting of cations and anions.
942 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Figure 18.2 The location of the representative metals is shown in the periodic table. Nonmetals are shown in green,
metalloids in purple, and the transition metals and inner transition metals in blue.
Most of the representative metals do not occur naturally in an uncombined state because they readily react with water
and oxygen in the air. However, it is possible to isolate elemental beryllium, magnesium, zinc, cadmium, mercury,
aluminum, tin, and lead from their naturally occurring minerals and use them because they react very slowly with air.
Part of the reason why these elements react slowly is that these elements react with air to form a protective coating.
The formation of this protective coating is passivation. The coating is a nonreactive film of oxide or some other
compound. Elemental magnesium, aluminum, zinc, and tin are important in the fabrication of many familiar items,
including wire, cookware, foil, and many household and personal objects. Although beryllium, cadmium, mercury,
and lead are readily available, there are limitations in their use because of their toxicity.
Group 1: The Alkali Metals
The alkali metals lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and francium constitute group 1 of the periodic table.
Although hydrogen is in group 1 (and also in group 17), it is a nonmetal and deserves separate consideration later in
this chapter. The name alkali metal is in reference to the fact that these metals and their oxides react with water to
form very basic (alkaline) solutions.
The properties of the alkali metals are similar to each other as expected for elements in the same family. The alkali
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 943
metals have the largest atomic radii and the lowest first ionization energy in their periods. This combination makes it
very easy to remove the single electron in the outermost (valence) shell of each. The easy loss of this valence electron
means that these metals readily form stable cations with a charge of 1+. Their reactivity increases with increasing
atomic number due to the ease of losing the lone valence electron (decreasing ionization energy). Since oxidation
is so easy, the reverse, reduction, is difficult, which explains why it is hard to isolate the elements. The solid alkali
metals are very soft; lithium, shown in Figure 18.3, has the lowest density of any metal (0.5 g/cm3).
The alkali metals all react vigorously with water to form hydrogen gas and a basic solution of the metal hydroxide.
This means they are easier to oxidize than is hydrogen. As an example, the reaction of lithium with water is:

Figure 18.3 Lithium floats in paraffin oil because its density is less than the density of paraffin oil.
Alkali metals react directly with all the nonmetals (except the noble gases) to yield binary ionic compounds
containing 1+ metal ions. These metals are so reactive that it is necessary to avoid contact with both moisture and
oxygen in the air. Therefore, they are stored in sealed containers under mineral oil, as shown in Figure 18.4, to
prevent contact with air and moisture. The pure metals never exist free (uncombined) in nature due to their high
reactivity. In addition, this high reactivity makes it necessary to prepare the metals by electrolysis of alkali metal
compounds.

Unlike many other metals, the reactivity and softness of the alkali metals make these metals unsuitable for structural
applications. However, there are applications where the reactivity of the alkali metals is an advantage. For example,
the production of metals such as titanium and zirconium relies, in part, on the ability of sodium to reduce compounds
of these metals. The manufacture of many organic compounds, including certain dyes, drugs, and perfumes, utilizes
reduction by lithium or sodium.
Sodium and its compounds impart a bright yellow color to a flame, as seen in Figure 18.5. Passing an electrical
discharge through sodium vapor also produces this color. In both cases, this is an example of an emission spectrum
as discussed in the chapter on electronic structure. Streetlights sometime employ sodium vapor lights because the
sodium vapor penetrates fog better than most other light. This is because the fog does not scatter yellow light as much
as it scatters white light. The other alkali metals and their salts also impart color to a flame. Lithium creates a bright,
crimson color, whereas the others create a pale, violet color.

with water.
Group 2: The Alkaline Earth Metals
The alkaline earth metals (beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and radium) constitute group 2 of the
periodic table. The name alkaline metal comes from the fact that the oxides of the heavier members of the group react
with water to form alkaline solutions. The nuclear charge increases when going from group 1 to group 2. Because
of this charge increase, the atoms of the alkaline earth metals are smaller and have higher first ionization energies
than the alkali metals within the same period. The higher ionization energy makes the alkaline earth metals less
reactive than the alkali metals; however, they are still very reactive elements. Their reactivity increases, as expected,
with increasing size and decreasing ionization energy. In chemical reactions, these metals readily lose both valence
electrons to form compounds in which they exhibit an oxidation state of 2+. Due to their high reactivity, it is common
to produce the alkaline earth metals, like the alkali metals, by electrolysis. Even though the ionization energies are
low, the two metals with the highest ionization energies (beryllium and magnesium) do form compounds that exhibit

some covalent characters. Like the alkali metals, the heavier alkaline earth metals impart color to a flame. As in the
case of the alkali metals, this is part of the emission spectrum of these elements. Calcium and strontium produce
shades of red, whereas barium produces a green color.
Magnesium is a silver-white metal that is malleable and ductile at high temperatures. Passivation decreases the
reactivity of magnesium metal. Upon exposure to air, a tightly adhering layer of magnesium oxycarbonate forms
on the surface of the metal and inhibits further reaction. (The carbonate comes from the reaction of carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere.) Magnesium is the lightest of the widely used structural metals, which is why most magnesium
production is for lightweight alloys.
Magnesium (shown in Figure 18.6), calcium, strontium, and barium react with water and air. At room temperature,
barium shows the most vigorous reaction. The products of the reaction with water are hydrogen and the metal
hydroxide. The formation of hydrogen gas indicates that the heavier alkaline earth metals are better reducing agents
(more easily oxidized) than is hydrogen. As expected, these metals react with both acids and nonmetals to form ionic
compounds. Unlike most salts of the alkali metals, many of the common salts of the alkaline earth metals are insoluble
in water because of the high lattice energies of these compounds, containing a divalent metal ion.
Figure 18.6 From left to right: Mg(s), warm water at pH 7, and the resulting solution with a pH greater than 7, as
indicated by the pink color of the phenolphthalein indicator. (credit: modification of work by Sahar Atwa)
The potent reducing power of hot magnesium is useful in preparing some metals from their oxides. Indeed,
magnesium’s affinity for oxygen is so great that burning magnesium reacts with carbon dioxide, producing elemental
carbon:
2Mg(s) + CO2(g) ⟶ 2MgO(s) + C(s)
For this reason, a CO2 fire extinguisher will not extinguish a magnesium fire. Additionally, the brilliant white light
emitted by burning magnesium makes it useful in flares and fireworks.
Group 12
The elements in group 12 are transition elements; however, the last electron added is not a d electron, but an s electron.
Since the last electron added is an s electron, these elements qualify as representative metals, or post-transition metals.
The group 12 elements behave more like the alkaline earth metals than transition metals. Group 12 contains the four
elements zinc, cadmium, mercury, and copernicium. Each of these elements has two electrons in its outer shell (ns2).
When atoms of these metals form cations with a charge of 2+, where the two outer electrons are lost, they have
pseudo-noble gas electron configurations. Mercury is sometimes an exception because it also exhibits an oxidation
state of 1+ in compounds that contain a diatomic Hg2 2+ ion. In their elemental forms and in compounds, cadmium
and mercury are both toxic.
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 947
Zinc is the most reactive in group 12, and mercury is the least reactive. (This is the reverse of the reactivity trend of
the metals of groups 1 and 2, in which reactivity increases down a group. The increase in reactivity with increasing
atomic number only occurs for the metals in groups 1 and 2.) The decreasing reactivity is due to the formation of ions
with a pseudo-noble gas configuration and to other factors that are beyond the scope of this discussion. The chemical
behaviors of zinc and cadmium are quite similar to each other but differ from that of mercury.
Zinc and cadmium have lower reduction potentials than hydrogen, and, like the alkali metals and alkaline earth
metals, they will produce hydrogen gas when they react with acids. The reaction of zinc with hydrochloric acid,
shown in Figure 18.7, is:
Zn(s) + 2H3 O+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq) ⟶ H2(g) + Zn2+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq) + 2H2 O(l)
Figure 18.7 Zinc is an active metal. It dissolves in hydrochloric acid, forming a solution of colorless Zn2+ ions, Cl–
ions, and hydrogen gas.
Zinc is a silvery metal that quickly tarnishes to a blue-gray appearance. This change in color is due to an adherent
coating of a basic carbonate, Zn2(OH)2CO3, which passivates the metal to inhibit further corrosion. Dry cell and
alkaline batteries contain a zinc anode. Brass (Cu and Zn) and some bronze (Cu, Sn, and sometimes Zn) are important
zinc alloys. About half of zinc production serves to protect iron and other metals from corrosion. This protection
may take the form of a sacrificial anode (also known as a galvanic anode, which is a means of providing cathodic
protection for various metals) or as a thin coating on the protected metal. Galvanized steel is steel with a protective
coating of zinc.
Sacrificial Anodes
A sacrificial anode, or galvanic anode, is a means of providing cathodic protection of various metals. Cathodic
protection refers to the prevention of corrosion by converting the corroding metal into a cathode. As a cathode,
the metal resists corrosion, which is an oxidation process. Corrosion occurs at the sacrificial anode instead of
at the cathode.
The construction of such a system begins with the attachment of a more active metal (more negative reduction
potential) to the metal needing protection. Attachment may be direct or via a wire. To complete the circuit, a salt
bridge is necessary. This salt bridge is often seawater or ground water. Once the circuit is complete, oxidation
(corrosion) occurs at the anode and not the cathode.
The commonly used sacrificial anodes are magnesium, aluminum, and zinc. Magnesium has the most negative
reduction potential of the three and serves best when the salt bridge is less efficient due to a low electrolyte

concentration such as in freshwater. Zinc and aluminum work better in saltwater than does magnesium.
Aluminum is lighter than zinc and has a higher capacity; however, an oxide coating may passivate the
aluminum. In special cases, other materials are useful. For example, iron will protect copper.
Mercury is very different from zinc and cadmium. Mercury is the only metal that is liquid at 25 °C. Many metals
dissolve in mercury, forming solutions called amalgams (see the feature on Amalgams), which are alloys of mercury
with one or more other metals. Mercury, shown in Figure 18.8, is a nonreactive element that is more difficult to
oxidize than hydrogen. Thus, it does not displace hydrogen from acids; however, it will react with strong oxidizing
acids, such as nitric acid:
Hg(l) + HCl(aq) ⟶ no reaction
3Hg(l) + 8HNO3(aq) ⟶ 3Hg(NO3)2(aq) + 4H2 O(l) + 2NO(g)
The clear NO initially formed quickly undergoes further oxidation to the reddish brown NO2.
Figure 18.8 From left to right: Hg(l), Hg + concentrated HCl, Hg + concentrated HNO3. (credit: Sahar Atwa)
Most mercury compounds decompose when heated. Most mercury compounds contain mercury with a 2+-oxidation
state. When there is a large excess of mercury, it is possible to form compounds containing the Hg2 2+ ion. All
mercury compounds are toxic, and it is necessary to exercise great care in their synthesis.
Amalgams
An amalgam is an alloy of mercury with one or more other metals. This is similar to considering steel to be an
alloy of iron with other metals. Most metals will form an amalgam with mercury, with the main exceptions being
iron, platinum, tungsten, and tantalum.
Due to toxicity issues with mercury, there has been a significant decrease in the use of amalgams. Historically,
amalgams were important in electrolytic cells and in the extraction of gold. Amalgams of the alkali metals still
find use because they are strong reducing agents and easier to handle than the pure alkali metals.
Prospectors had a problem when they found finely divided gold. They learned that adding mercury to their pans
Chemistry in Everyday Life
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 949
collected the gold into the mercury to form an amalgam for easier collection. Unfortunately, losses of small
amounts of mercury over the years left many streams in California polluted with mercury.
Dentists use amalgams containing silver and other metals to fill cavities. There are several reasons to use
an amalgam including low cost, ease of manipulation, and longevity compared to alternate materials. Dental
amalgams are approximately 50% mercury by weight, which, in recent years, has become a concern due to
the toxicity of mercury.
After reviewing the best available data, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers amalgam-based
fillings to be safe for adults and children over six years of age. Even with multiple fillings, the mercury levels
in the patients remain far below the lowest levels associated with harm. Clinical studies have found no link
between dental amalgams and health problems. Health issues may not be the same in cases of children under
six or pregnant women. The FDA conclusions are in line with the opinions of the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The only health consideration noted is that some people
are allergic to the amalgam or one of its components.
Group 13
Group 13 contains the metalloid boron and the metals aluminum, gallium, indium, and thallium. The lightest element,
boron, is semiconducting, and its binary compounds tend to be covalent and not ionic. The remaining elements of
the group are metals, but their oxides and hydroxides change characters. The oxides and hydroxides of aluminum
and gallium exhibit both acidic and basic behaviors. A substance, such as these two, that will react with both acids
and bases is amphoteric. This characteristic illustrates the combination of nonmetallic and metallic behaviors of these
two elements. Indium and thallium oxides and hydroxides exhibit only basic behavior, in accordance with the clearly
metallic character of these two elements. The melting point of gallium is unusually low (about 30 °C) and will melt
in your hand.
Aluminum is amphoteric because it will react with both acids and bases. A typical reaction with an acid is:
2Al(s) + 6HCl(aq) ⟶ 2AlCl3(aq) + 3H2(g)
The products of the reaction of aluminum with a base depend upon the reaction conditions, with the following being
one possibility:
2Al(s) + 2NaOH(aq) + 6H2 O(l) ⟶ 2Na⎡
⎣Al(OH)4⎤
⎦(aq) + 3H2(g)
With both acids and bases, the reaction with aluminum generates hydrogen gas.
The group 13 elements have a valence shell electron configuration of ns2np1. Aluminum normally uses all of its
valence electrons when it reacts, giving compounds in which it has an oxidation state of 3+. Although many of
these compounds are covalent, others, such as AlF3 and Al2(SO4)3, are ionic. Aqueous solutions of aluminum salts
contain the cation ⎡
⎣Al⎛
⎝H2 O⎞
⎠6⎤
⎦
3+, abbreviated as Al3+(aq). Gallium, indium, and thallium also form ionic compounds
containing M3+ ions. These three elements exhibit not only the expected oxidation state of 3+ from the three valence
electrons but also an oxidation state (in this case, 1+) that is two below the expected value. This phenomenon, the inert
pair effect, refers to the formation of a stable ion with an oxidation state two lower than expected for the group. The
pair of electrons is the valence s orbital for those elements. In general, the inert pair effect is important for the lower
p-block elements. In an aqueous solution, the Tl+(aq) ion is more stable than is Tl3+(aq). In general, these metals will
react with air and water to form 3+ ions; however, thallium reacts to give thallium(I) derivatives. The metals of group
13 all react directly with nonmetals such as sulfur, phosphorus, and the halogens, forming binary compounds.
The metals of group 13 (Al, Ga, In, and Tl) are all reactive. However, passivation occurs as a tough, hard, thin film
of the metal oxide forms upon exposure to air. Disruption of this film may counter the passivation, allowing the metal
to react. One way to disrupt the film is to expose the passivated metal to mercury. Some of the metal dissolves in
the mercury to form an amalgam, which sheds the protective oxide layer to expose the metal to further reaction. The
formation of an amalgam allows the metal to react with air and water.

Although easily oxidized, the passivation of aluminum makes it very useful as a strong, lightweight
building material. Because of the formation of an amalgam, mercury is corrosive to structural materials
made of aluminum. This video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16aluminumhg) demonstrates how the
integrity of an aluminum beam can be destroyed by the addition of a small amount of elemental mercury.
The most important uses of aluminum are in the construction and transportation industries, and in the manufacture of
aluminum cans and aluminum foil. These uses depend on the lightness, toughness, and strength of the metal, as well
as its resistance to corrosion. Because aluminum is an excellent conductor of heat and resists corrosion, it is useful in
the manufacture of cooking utensils.
Aluminum is a very good reducing agent and may replace other reducing agents in the isolation of certain metals from
their oxides. Although more expensive than reduction by carbon, aluminum is important in the isolation of Mo, W,
and Cr from their oxides.
Group 14
The metallic members of group 14 are tin, lead, and flerovium. Carbon is a typical nonmetal. The remaining elements
of the group, silicon and germanium, are examples of semimetals or metalloids. Tin and lead form the stable divalent
cations, Sn2+ and Pb2+, with oxidation states two below the group oxidation state of 4+. The stability of this oxidation
state is a consequence of the inert pair effect. Tin and lead also form covalent compounds with a formal 4+-oxidation
state. For example, SnCl4 and PbCl4 are low-boiling covalent liquids.
Figure 18.9 (a) Tin(II) chloride is an ionic solid; (b) tin(IV) chloride is a covalent liquid.
Tin reacts readily with nonmetals and acids to form tin(II) compounds (indicating that it is more easily oxidized than
hydrogen) and with nonmetals to form either tin(II) or tin(IV) compounds (shown in Figure 18.9), depending on the
stoichiometry and reaction conditions. Lead is less reactive. It is only slightly easier to oxidize than hydrogen, and
oxidation normally requires a hot concentrated acid.
Many of these elements exist as allotropes. Allotropes are two or more forms of the same element in the same
physical state with different chemical and physical properties. There are two common allotropes of tin. These
allotropes are grey (brittle) tin and white tin. As with other allotropes, the difference between these forms of tin
is in the arrangement of the atoms. White tin is stable above 13.2 °C and is malleable like other metals. At low
temperatures, gray tin is the more stable form. Gray tin is brittle and tends to break down to a powder. Consequently,
Link to Learning
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 951
articles made of tin will disintegrate in cold weather, particularly if the cold spell is lengthy. The change progresses
slowly from the spot of origin, and the gray tin that is first formed catalyzes further change. In a way, this effect is
similar to the spread of an infection in a plant or animal body, leading people to call this process tin disease or tin
pest.
The principal use of tin is in the coating of steel to form tin plate-sheet iron, which constitutes the tin in tin cans.
Important tin alloys are bronze (Cu and Sn) and solder (Sn and Pb). Lead is important in the lead storage batteries in
automobiles.
Group 15
Bismuth, the heaviest member of group 15, is a less reactive metal than the other representative metals. It readily
gives up three of its five valence electrons to active nonmetals to form the tri-positive ion, Bi3+. It forms compounds
with the group oxidation state of 5+ only when treated with strong oxidizing agents. The stability of the 3+-oxidation
state is another example of the inert pair effect.
18.2 Occurrence and Preparation of the Representative
Metals
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Identify natural sources of representative metals
• Describe electrolytic and chemical reduction processes used to prepare these elements from natural sources
Because of their reactivity, we do not find most representative metals as free elements in nature. However, compounds
that contain ions of most representative metals are abundant. In this section, we will consider the two common
techniques used to isolate the metals from these compounds—electrolysis and chemical reduction.
These metals primarily occur in minerals, with lithium found in silicate or phosphate minerals, and sodium and
potassium found in salt deposits from evaporation of ancient seas and in silicates. The alkaline earth metals occur
as silicates and, with the exception of beryllium, as carbonates and sulfates. Beryllium occurs as the mineral beryl,
Be3Al2Si6O18, which, with certain impurities, may be either the gemstone emerald or aquamarine. Magnesium is in
seawater and, along with the heavier alkaline earth metals, occurs as silicates, carbonates, and sulfates. Aluminum
occurs abundantly in many types of clay and in bauxite, an impure aluminum oxide hydroxide. The principle tin ore
is the oxide cassiterite, SnO2, and the principle lead and thallium ores are the sulfides or the products of weathering
of the sulfides. The remaining representative metals occur as impurities in zinc or aluminum ores.
Electrolysis
Ions of metals in of groups 1 and 2, along with aluminum, are very difficult to reduce; therefore, it is necessary to
prepare these elements by electrolysis, an important process discussed in the chapter on electrochemistry. Briefly,
electrolysis involves using electrical energy to drive unfavorable chemical reactions to completion; it is useful in the
isolation of reactive metals in their pure forms. Sodium, aluminum, and magnesium are typical examples.
The Preparation of Sodium
The most important method for the production of sodium is the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride; the set-up is a
Downs cell, shown in Figure 18.10. The reaction involved in this process is:
2NaCl(l) →⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯
600 °C
electrolysis 2Na(l) + Cl2(g)
The electrolysis cell contains molten sodium chloride (melting point 801 °C), to which calcium chloride has been
added to lower the melting point to 600 °C (a colligative effect). The passage of a direct current through the cell
952 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
causes the sodium ions to migrate to the negatively charged cathode and pick up electrons, reducing the ions to sodium
metal. Chloride ions migrate to the positively charged anode, lose electrons, and undergo oxidation to chlorine gas.
The overall cell reaction comes from adding the following reactions:
at the cathode: 2Na+ + 2e− ⟶ 2Na(l)
at the anode: 2Cl− ⟶ Cl2(g) + 2e−
overall change: 2Na+ + 2Cl− ⟶ 2Na(l) + Cl2(g)
Separation of the molten sodium and chlorine prevents recombination. The liquid sodium, which is less dense than
molten sodium chloride, floats to the surface and flows into a collector. The gaseous chlorine goes to storage tanks.
Chlorine is also a valuable product.
Figure 18.10 Pure sodium metal is isolated by electrolysis of molten sodium chloride using a Downs cell. It is not
possible to isolate sodium by electrolysis of aqueous solutions of sodium salts because hydrogen ions are more
easily reduced than are sodium ions; as a result, hydrogen gas forms at the cathode instead of the desired sodium
metal. The high temperature required to melt NaCl means that liquid sodium metal forms.
The Preparation of Aluminum
The preparation of aluminum utilizes a process invented in 1886 by Charles M. Hall, who began to work on the
problem while a student at Oberlin College in Ohio. Paul L. T. Héroult discovered the process independently a month
or two later in France. In honor to the two inventors, this electrolysis cell is known as the Hall–Héroult cell. The
Hall–Héroult cell is an electrolysis cell for the production of aluminum. Figure 18.11 illustrates the Hall–Héroult
cell.
The production of aluminum begins with the purification of bauxite, the most common source of aluminum. The
reaction of bauxite, AlO(OH), with hot sodium hydroxide forms soluble sodium aluminate, while clay and other
impurities remain undissolved:
AlO(OH)(s) + NaOH(aq) + H2 O(l) ⟶ Na[Al(OH)4](aq)
After the removal of the impurities by filtration, the addition of acid to the aluminate leads to the reprecipitation of
aluminum hydroxide:
Na[Al(OH)4](aq) + H3 O+(aq) ⟶ Al(OH)3(s) + Na+(aq) + 2H2 O(l)
The next step is to remove the precipitated aluminum hydroxide by filtration. Heating the hydroxide produces
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 953
aluminum oxide, Al2O3, which dissolves in a molten mixture of cryolite, Na3AlF6, and calcium fluoride, CaF2.
Electrolysis of this solution takes place in a cell like that shown in Figure 18.11. Reduction of aluminum ions to the
metal occurs at the cathode, while oxygen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide form at the anode.
Figure 18.11 An electrolytic cell is used for the production of aluminum. The electrolysis of a solution of cryolite and
calcium fluoride results in aluminum metal at the cathode, and oxygen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide at the
anode.
The Preparation of Magnesium
Magnesium is the other metal that is isolated in large quantities by electrolysis. Seawater, which contains
approximately 0.5% magnesium chloride, serves as the major source of magnesium. Addition of calcium hydroxide to
seawater precipitates magnesium hydroxide. The addition of hydrochloric acid to magnesium hydroxide, followed by
evaporation of the resultant aqueous solution, leaves pure magnesium chloride. The electrolysis of molten magnesium
chloride forms liquid magnesium and chlorine gas:
MgCl2(aq) + Ca(OH)2(aq) ⟶ Mg(OH)2(s) + CaCl2(aq)
Mg(OH)2(s) + 2HCl(aq) ⟶ MgCl2(aq) + 2H2 O(l)
MgCl2(l) ⟶ Mg(l) + Cl2(g)
Some production facilities have moved away from electrolysis completely. In the next section, we will see how the
Pidgeon process leads to the chemical reduction of magnesium.
Chemical Reduction
It is possible to isolate many of the representative metals by chemical reduction using other elements as reducing
agents. In general, chemical reduction is much less expensive than electrolysis, and for this reason, chemical reduction
is the method of choice for the isolation of these elements. For example, it is possible to produce potassium, rubidium,
and cesium by chemical reduction, as it is possible to reduce the molten chlorides of these metals with sodium
954 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
metal. This may be surprising given that these metals are more reactive than sodium; however, the metals formed are
more volatile than sodium and can be distilled for collection. The removal of the metal vapor leads to a shift in the
equilibrium to produce more metal (see how reactions can be driven in the discussions of Le Châtelier’s principle in
the chapter on fundamental equilibrium concepts).
The production of magnesium, zinc, and tin provide additional examples of chemical reduction.
The Preparation of Magnesium
The Pidgeon process involves the reaction of magnesium oxide with elemental silicon at high temperatures to form
pure magnesium:
Si(s) + 2MgO(s) →⎯⎯
Δ SiO2(s) + 2Mg(g)
Although this reaction is unfavorable in terms of thermodynamics, the removal of the magnesium vapor produced
takes advantage of Le Châtelier’s principle to continue the forward progress of the reaction. Over 75% of the world’s
production of magnesium, primarily in China, comes from this process.
The Preparation of Zinc
Zinc ores usually contain zinc sulfide, zinc oxide, or zinc carbonate. After separation of these compounds from the
ores, heating in air converts the ore to zinc oxide by one of the following reactions:
2ZnS(s) + 3O2(g) →⎯⎯
Δ 2ZnO(s) + 2SO2(g)
ZnCO3(s) →⎯⎯
Δ ZnO(s) + CO2(g)
Carbon, in the form of coal, reduces the zinc oxide to form zinc vapor:
ZnO(s) + C(s) ⟶ Zn(g) + CO(g)
The zinc can be distilled (boiling point 907 °C) and condensed. This zinc contains impurities of cadmium (767 °C),
iron (2862 °C), lead (1750 °C), and arsenic (613 °C). Careful redistillation produces pure zinc. Arsenic and cadmium
are distilled from the zinc because they have lower boiling points. At higher temperatures, the zinc is distilled from
the other impurities, mainly lead and iron.
The Preparation of Tin
The ready reduction of tin(IV) oxide by the hot coals of a campfire accounts for the knowledge of tin in the ancient
world. In the modern process, the roasting of tin ores containing SnO2 removes contaminants such as arsenic and
sulfur as volatile oxides. Treatment of the remaining material with hydrochloric acid removes the oxides of other
metals. Heating the purified ore with carbon at temperature above 1000 °C produces tin:
SnO2(s) + 2C(s) →⎯⎯
Δ Sn(s) + 2CO(g)
The molten tin collects at the bottom of the furnace and is drawn off and cast into blocks.
18.3 Structure and General Properties of the Metalloids
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the general preparation, properties, and uses of the metalloids
• Describe the preparation, properties, and compounds of boron and silicon
A series of six elements called the metalloids separate the metals from the nonmetals in the periodic table. The
metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium. These elements look metallic; however,
they do not conduct electricity as well as metals so they are semiconductors. They are semiconductors because their
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 955
electrons are more tightly bound to their nuclei than are those of metallic conductors. Their chemical behavior falls
between that of metals and nonmetals. For example, the pure metalloids form covalent crystals like the nonmetals,
but like the metals, they generally do not form monatomic anions. This intermediate behavior is in part due to their
intermediate electronegativity values. In this section, we will briefly discuss the chemical behavior of metalloids and
deal with two of these elements—boron and silicon—in more detail.
The metalloid boron exhibits many similarities to its neighbor carbon and its diagonal neighbor silicon. All three
elements form covalent compounds. However, boron has one distinct difference in that its 2s22p1 outer electron
structure gives it one less valence electron than it has valence orbitals. Although boron exhibits an oxidation state of
3+ in most of its stable compounds, this electron deficiency provides boron with the ability to form other, sometimes
fractional, oxidation states, which occur, for example, in the boron hydrides.
Silicon has the valence shell electron configuration 3s23p2, and it commonly forms tetrahedral structures in which
it is sp3 hybridized with a formal oxidation state of 4+. The major differences between the chemistry of carbon and
silicon result from the relative strength of the carbon-carbon bond, carbon’s ability to form stable bonds to itself, and
the presence of the empty 3d valence-shell orbitals in silicon. Silicon’s empty d orbitals and boron’s empty p orbital
enable tetrahedral silicon compounds and trigonal planar boron compounds to act as Lewis acids. Carbon, on the other
hand, has no available valence shell orbitals; tetrahedral carbon compounds cannot act as Lewis acids. Germanium is
very similar to silicon in its chemical behavior.
Arsenic and antimony generally form compounds in which an oxidation state of 3+ or 5+ is exhibited; however,
arsenic can form arsenides with an oxidation state of 3−. These elements tarnish only slightly in dry air but readily
oxidize when warmed.
Tellurium combines directly with most elements. The most stable tellurium compounds are the tellurides—salts of
Te2− formed with active metals and lanthanides—and compounds with oxygen, fluorine, and chlorine, in which
tellurium normally exhibits an oxidation state 2+ or 4+. Although tellurium(VI) compounds are known (for example,
TeF6), there is a marked resistance to oxidation to this maximum group oxidation state.
Structures of the Metalloids
Covalent bonding is the key to the crystal structures of the metalloids. In this regard, these elements resemble
nonmetals in their behavior.
Elemental silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium are lustrous, metallic-looking solids. Silicon and
germanium crystallize with a diamond structure. Each atom within the crystal has covalent bonds to four neighboring
atoms at the corners of a regular tetrahedron. Single crystals of silicon and germanium are giant, three-dimensional
molecules. There are several allotropes of arsenic with the most stable being layer like and containing puckered sheets
of arsenic atoms. Each arsenic atom forms covalent bonds to three other atoms within the sheet. The crystal structure
of antimony is similar to that of arsenic, both shown in Figure 18.12. The structures of arsenic and antimony are
similar to the structure of graphite, covered later in this chapter. Tellurium forms crystals that contain infinite spiral
chains of tellurium atoms. Each atom in the chain bonds to two other atoms.

Pure crystalline boron is transparent. The crystals consist of icosahedra, as shown in Figure 18.13, with a boron
atom at each corner. In the most common form of boron, the icosahedra pack together in a manner similar to the
cubic closest packing of spheres. All boron-boron bonds within each icosahedron are identical and are approximately
176 pm in length. In the different forms of boron, there are different arrangements and connections between the
icosahedra.
Figure 18.13 An icosahedron is a symmetrical, solid shape with 20 faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle.
The faces meet at 12 corners.
The name silicon is derived from the Latin word for flint, silex. The metalloid silicon readily forms compounds
containing Si-O-Si bonds, which are of prime importance in the mineral world. This bonding capability is in contrast
to the nonmetal carbon, whose ability to form carbon-carbon bonds gives it prime importance in the plant and animal
worlds.
Occurrence, Preparation, and Compounds of Boron and Silicon
Boron constitutes less than 0.001% by weight of the earth’s crust. In nature, it only occurs in compounds with oxygen.
Boron is widely distributed in volcanic regions as boric acid, B(OH)3, and in dry lake regions, including the desert
areas of California, as borates and salts of boron oxyacids, such as borax, Na2B4O7⋅10H2O.
Elemental boron is chemically inert at room temperature, reacting with only fluorine and oxygen to form boron
trifluoride, BF3, and boric oxide, B2O3, respectively. At higher temperatures, boron reacts with all nonmetals, except
tellurium and the noble gases, and with nearly all metals; it oxidizes to B2O3 when heated with concentrated nitric or
sulfuric acid. Boron does not react with nonoxidizing acids. Many boron compounds react readily with water to give
boric acid, B(OH)3 (sometimes written as H3BO3).
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 957
Reduction of boric oxide with magnesium powder forms boron (95–98.5% pure) as a brown, amorphous powder:
B2 O3(s) + 3Mg(s) ⟶ 2B(s) + 3MgO(s)
An amorphous substance is a material that appears to be a solid, but does not have a long-range order like a true
solid. Treatment with hydrochloric acid removes the magnesium oxide. Further purification of the boron begins with
conversion of the impure boron into boron trichloride. The next step is to heat a mixture of boron trichloride and
hydrogen:
2BCl3(g) + 3H2(g) →⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯
1500 °C 2B(s) + 6HCl(g) ΔH° = 253.7 kJ
Silicon makes up nearly one-fourth of the mass of the earth’s crust—second in abundance only to oxygen. The crust
is composed almost entirely of minerals in which the silicon atoms are at the center of the silicon-oxygen tetrahedron,
which connect in a variety of ways to produce, among other things, chains, layers, and three-dimensional frameworks.
These minerals constitute the bulk of most common rocks, soil, and clays. In addition, materials such as bricks,
ceramics, and glasses contain silicon compounds.
It is possible to produce silicon by the high-temperature reduction of silicon dioxide with strong reducing agents, such
as carbon and magnesium:
SiO2(s) + 2C(s) →⎯⎯
Δ Si(s) + 2CO(g)
SiO2(s) + 2Mg(s) →⎯⎯
Δ Si(s) + 2MgO(s)
Extremely pure silicon is necessary for the manufacture of semiconductor electronic devices. This process begins
with the conversion of impure silicon into silicon tetrahalides, or silane (SiH4), followed by decomposition at high
temperatures. Zone refining, illustrated in Figure 18.14, completes the purification. In this method, a rod of silicon
is heated at one end by a heat source that produces a thin cross-section of molten silicon. Slowly lowering the rod
through the heat source moves the molten zone from one end of the rod to other. As this thin, molten region moves,
impurities in the silicon dissolve in the liquid silicon and move with the molten region. Ultimately, the impurities
move to one end of the rod, which is then cut off.

Figure 18.14 A zone-refining apparatus used to purify silicon.
This highly purified silicon, containing no more than one part impurity per million parts of silicon, is the most
important element in the computer industry. Pure silicon is necessary in semiconductor electronic devices such as
transistors, computer chips, and solar cells.
Like some metals, passivation of silicon occurs due the formation of a very thin film of oxide (primarily silicon
dioxide, SiO2). Silicon dioxide is soluble in hot aqueous base; thus, strong bases destroy the passivation. Removal of
the passivation layer allows the base to dissolve the silicon, forming hydrogen gas and silicate anions. For example:
Si(s) + 4OH−(aq) ⟶ SiO4 4−(aq) + 2H2(g)
Silicon reacts with halogens at high temperatures, forming volatile tetrahalides, such as SiF4.
Unlike carbon, silicon does not readily form double or triple bonds. Silicon compounds of the general formula SiX4,
where X is a highly electronegative group, can act as Lewis acids to form six-coordinate silicon. For example, silicon
tetrafluoride, SiF4, reacts with sodium fluoride to yield Na2[SiF6], which contains the octahedral ⎡
⎣SiF6⎤
⎦2− ion in
which silicon is sp3d2 hybridized:
2NaF(s) + SiF4(g) ⟶ Na2 SiF6(s)
Antimony reacts readily with stoichiometric amounts of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, yielding trihalides or,
with excess fluorine or chlorine, forming the pentahalides SbF5 and SbCl5. Depending on the stoichiometry, it forms
antimony(III) sulfide, Sb2S3, or antimony(V) sulfide when heated with sulfur. As expected, the metallic nature of the
element is greater than that of arsenic, which lies immediately above it in group 15.
Boron and Silicon Halides
Boron trihalides—BF3, BCl3, BBr3, and BI3—can be prepared by the direct reaction of the elements. These nonpolar
molecules contain boron with sp2 hybridization and a trigonal planar molecular geometry. The fluoride and chloride
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 959
compounds are colorless gasses, the bromide is a liquid, and the iodide is a white crystalline solid.
Except for boron trifluoride, the boron trihalides readily hydrolyze in water to form boric acid and the corresponding
hydrohalic acid. Boron trichloride reacts according to the equation:
BCl3(g) + 3H2 O(l) ⟶ B(OH)3(aq) + 3HCl(aq)
Boron trifluoride reacts with hydrofluoric acid, to yield a solution of fluoroboric acid, HBF4:
BF3(aq) + HF(aq) + H2 O(l) ⟶ H3 O+(aq) + BF4 −(aq)
In this reaction, the BF3 molecule acts as the Lewis acid (electron pair acceptor) and accepts a pair of electrons from
a fluoride ion:
All the tetrahalides of silicon, SiX4, have been prepared. Silicon tetrachloride can be prepared by direct chlorination
at elevated temperatures or by heating silicon dioxide with chlorine and carbon:
SiO2(s) + 2C(s) + 2Cl2(g) →⎯⎯
Δ SiCl4(g) + 2CO(g)
Silicon tetrachloride is a covalent tetrahedral molecule, which is a nonpolar, low-boiling (57 °C), colorless liquid.
It is possible to prepare silicon tetrafluoride by the reaction of silicon dioxide with hydrofluoric acid:
SiO2(s) + 4HF(g) ⟶ SiF4(g) + 2H2 O(l) ΔH° = −191.2 kJ
Hydrofluoric acid is the only common acid that will react with silicon dioxide or silicates. This reaction occurs
because the silicon-fluorine bond is the only bond that silicon forms that is stronger than the silicon-oxygen bond. For
this reason, it is possible to store all common acids, other than hydrofluoric acid, in glass containers.
Except for silicon tetrafluoride, silicon halides are extremely sensitive to water. Upon exposure to water, SiCl4 reacts
rapidly with hydroxide groups, replacing all four chlorine atoms to produce unstable orthosilicic acid, Si(OH)4 or
H4SiO4, which slowly decomposes into SiO2.
Boron and Silicon Oxides and Derivatives
Boron burns at 700 °C in oxygen, forming boric oxide, B2O3. Boric oxide is necessary for the production of heat-
resistant borosilicate glass, like that shown in Figure 18.15 and certain optical glasses. Boric oxide dissolves in hot
water to form boric acid, B(OH)3:

Figure 18.15 Laboratory glassware, such as Pyrex and Kimax, is made of borosilicate glass because it does not
break when heated. The inclusion of borates in the glass helps to mediate the effects of thermal expansion and
contraction. This reduces the likelihood of thermal shock, which causes silicate glass to crack upon rapid heating or
cooling. (credit: “Tweenk”/Wikimedia Commons)
The boron atom in B(OH)3 is sp2 hybridized and is located at the center of an equilateral triangle with oxygen atoms
at the corners. In solid B(OH)3, hydrogen bonding holds these triangular units together. Boric acid, shown in Figure
18.16, is a very weak acid that does not act as a proton donor but rather as a Lewis acid, accepting an unshared pair
of electrons from the Lewis base OH−:
B(OH)3(aq) + 2H2 O(l) ⇌ B(OH)4 −(aq) + H3 O+(aq) Ka = 5.8 × 10−10
Figure 18.16 Boric acid has a planar structure with three –OH groups spread out equally at 120° angles from each
other.
Heating boric acid to 100 °C causes molecules of water to split out between pairs of adjacent –OH groups to form
metaboric acid, HBO2. At about 150 °C, additional B-O-B linkages form, connecting the BO3 groups together with
shared oxygen atoms to form tetraboric acid, H2B4O7. Complete water loss, at still higher temperatures, results in
boric oxide.
Borates are salts of the oxyacids of boron. Borates result from the reactions of a base with an oxyacid or from
the fusion of boric acid or boric oxide with a metal oxide or hydroxide. Borate anions range from the simple
trigonal planar BO3 3− ion to complex species containing chains and rings of three- and four-coordinated boron
atoms. The structures of the anions found in CaB2O4, K[B5O6(OH)4]⋅2H2O (commonly written KB5O8⋅4H2O) and
Na2[B4O5(OH)4]⋅8H2O (commonly written Na2B4O7⋅10H2O) are shown in Figure 18.17. Commercially, the most
important borate is borax, Na2[B4O5(OH)4]⋅8H2O, which is an important component of some laundry detergents.
Most of the supply of borax comes directly from dry lakes, such as Searles Lake in California, or is prepared from
kernite, Na2B4O7⋅4H2O.
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 961
Figure 18.17 The borate anions are (a) CaB2O4, (b) KB5O8⋅4H2O, and (c) Na2B4O7⋅10H2O. The anion in CaB2O4 is
an “infinite” chain.
Silicon dioxide, silica, occurs in both crystalline and amorphous forms. The usual crystalline form of silicon dioxide
is quartz, a hard, brittle, clear, colorless solid. It is useful in many ways—for architectural decorations, semiprecious
jewels, and frequency control in radio transmitters. Silica takes many crystalline forms, or polymorphs, in nature.
Trace amounts of Fe3+ in quartz give amethyst its characteristic purple color. The term quartz is also used for
articles such as tubing and lenses that are manufactured from amorphous silica. Opal is a naturally occurring form of
amorphous silica.
The contrast in structure and physical properties between silicon dioxide and carbon dioxide is interesting, as
illustrated in Figure 18.18. Solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) contains single CO2 molecules with each of the two
oxygen atoms attached to the carbon atom by double bonds. Very weak intermolecular forces hold the molecules
together in the crystal. The volatility of dry ice reflect these weak forces between molecules. In contrast, silicon
dioxide is a covalent network solid. In silicon dioxide, each silicon atom links to four oxygen atoms by single bonds
directed toward the corners of a regular tetrahedron, and SiO4 tetrahedra share oxygen atoms. This arrangement gives
a three dimensional, continuous, silicon-oxygen network. A quartz crystal is a macromolecule of silicon dioxide. The
difference between these two compounds is the ability of the group 14 elements to form strong π bonds. Second-
period elements, such as carbon, form very strong π bonds, which is why carbon dioxide forms small molecules with
strong double bonds. Elements below the second period, such as silicon, do not form π bonds as readily as second-
period elements, and when they do form, the π bonds are weaker than those formed by second-period elements. For
this reason, silicon dioxide does not contain π bonds but only σ bonds.

Figure 18.18 Because carbon tends to form double and triple bonds and silicon does not, (a) carbon dioxide is a
discrete molecule with two C=O double bonds and (b) silicon dioxide is an infinite network of oxygen atoms bridging
between silicon atoms with each silicon atom possessing four Si-O single bonds. (credit a photo: modification of work

At 1600 °C, quartz melts to yield a viscous liquid. When the liquid cools, it does not crystallize readily but usually
supercools and forms a glass, also called silica. The SiO4 tetrahedra in glassy silica have a random arrangement
characteristic of supercooled liquids, and the glass has some very useful properties. Silica is highly transparent to
both visible and ultraviolet light. For this reason, it is important in the manufacture of lamps that give radiation rich
in ultraviolet light and in certain optical instruments that operate with ultraviolet light. The coefficient of expansion
of silica glass is very low; therefore, rapid temperature changes do not cause it to fracture. CorningWare and other
ceramic cookware contain amorphous silica.
Silicates are salts containing anions composed of silicon and oxygen. In nearly all silicates, sp3-hybridized silicon
atoms occur at the centers of tetrahedra with oxygen at the corners. There is a variation in the silicon-to-oxygen ratio
that occurs because silicon-oxygen tetrahedra may exist as discrete, independent units or may share oxygen atoms at
corners in a variety of ways. In addition, the presence of a variety of cations gives rise to the large number of silicate
minerals.
Many ceramics are composed of silicates. By including small amounts of other compounds, it is possible to modify
the physical properties of the silicate materials to produce ceramics with useful characteristics.

18.4 Structure and General Properties of the Nonmetals
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe structure and properties of nonmetals
The nonmetals are elements located in the upper right portion of the periodic table. Their properties and behavior
are quite different from those of metals on the left side. Under normal conditions, more than half of the nonmetals
are gases, one is a liquid, and the rest include some of the softest and hardest of solids. The nonmetals exhibit a rich
variety of chemical behaviors. They include the most reactive and least reactive of elements, and they form many
different ionic and covalent compounds. This section presents an overview of the properties and chemical behaviors
of the nonmetals, as well as the chemistry of specific elements. Many of these nonmetals are important in biological
systems.
In many cases, trends in electronegativity enable us to predict the type of bonding and the physical states in
compounds involving the nonmetals. We know that electronegativity decreases as we move down a given group and
increases as we move from left to right across a period. The nonmetals have higher electronegativities than do metals,
and compounds formed between metals and nonmetals are generally ionic in nature because of the large differences
in electronegativity between them. The metals form cations, the nonmetals form anions, and the resulting compounds
are solids under normal conditions. On the other hand, compounds formed between two or more nonmetals have
small differences in electronegativity between the atoms, and covalent bonding—sharing of electrons—results. These
substances tend to be molecular in nature and are gases, liquids, or volatile solids at room temperature and pressure.
In normal chemical processes, nonmetals do not form monatomic positive ions (cations) because their ionization
energies are too high. All monatomic nonmetal ions are anions; examples include the chloride ion, Cl−, the nitride
ion, N3−, and the selenide ion, Se2−.
The common oxidation states that the nonmetals exhibit in their ionic and covalent compounds are shown in Figure
18.19. Remember that an element exhibits a positive oxidation state when combined with a more electronegative
element and that it exhibits a negative oxidation state when combined with a less electronegative element.
Figure 18.19 Nonmetals exhibit these common oxidation states in ionic and covalent compounds.
The first member of each nonmetal group exhibits different behaviors, in many respects, from the other group
members. The reasons for this include smaller size, greater ionization energy, and (most important) the fact that the
first member of each group has only four valence orbitals (one 2s and three 2p) available for bonding, whereas other
group members have empty d orbitals in their valence shells, making possible five, six, or even more bonds around
the central atom. For example, nitrogen forms only NF3, whereas phosphorus forms both PF3 and PF5.
Another difference between the first group member and subsequent members is the greater ability of the first member
to form π bonds. This is primarily a function of the smaller size of the first member of each group, which allows better
overlap of atomic orbitals. Nonmetals, other than the first member of each group, rarely form π bonds to nonmetals
that are the first member of a group. For example, sulfur-oxygen π bonds are well known, whereas sulfur does not
normally form stable π bonds to itself.
The variety of oxidation states displayed by most of the nonmetals means that many of their chemical reactions
964 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
involve changes in oxidation state through oxidation-reduction reactions. There are five general aspects of the
oxidation-reduction chemistry:
1. Nonmetals oxidize most metals. The oxidation state of the metal becomes positive as it undergoes oxidation
and that of the nonmetal becomes negative as it undergoes reduction. For example:
4Fe(s) + 3O2(g) ⟶ 2Fe2 O3(s)
0 0 +3 −2
2. With the exception of nitrogen and carbon, which are poor oxidizing agents, a more electronegative nonmetal
oxidizes a less electronegative nonmetal or the anion of the nonmetal:
S(s) + O2(g) ⟶ 2SO2(s)
0 0 +4 −2
Cl2(g) + 2I−(aq) ⟶ I2(s) + 2Cl−(aq)
0 0
3. Fluorine and oxygen are the strongest oxidizing agents within their respective groups; each oxidizes all the
elements that lie below it in the group. Within any period, the strongest oxidizing agent is in group 17. A
nonmetal often oxidizes an element that lies to its left in the same period. For example:
2As(s) + 3Br2(l) ⟶ 2AsBr3(s)
0 0 +3 −1
4. The stronger a nonmetal is as an oxidizing agent, the more difficult it is to oxidize the anion formed by the
nonmetal. This means that the most stable negative ions are formed by elements at the top of the group or in
group 17 of the period.
5. Fluorine and oxygen are the strongest oxidizing elements known. Fluorine does not form compounds in which
it exhibits positive oxidation states; oxygen exhibits a positive oxidation state only when combined with
fluorine. For example:
2F2(g) + 2OH−(aq) ⟶ OF2(g) + 2F−(aq) + H2 O(l)
0 +2 −1
With the exception of most of the noble gases, all nonmetals form compounds with oxygen, yielding covalent oxides.
Most of these oxides are acidic, that is, they react with water to form oxyacids. Recall from the acid-base chapter
that an oxyacid is an acid consisting of hydrogen, oxygen, and some other element. Notable exceptions are carbon
monoxide, CO, nitrous oxide, N2O, and nitric oxide, NO. There are three characteristics of these acidic oxides:
1. Oxides such as SO2 and N2O5, in which the nonmetal exhibits one of its common oxidation states, are acid
anhydrides and react with water to form acids with no change in oxidation state. The product is an oxyacid.
For example:
SO2(g) + H2 O(l) ⟶ H2 SO3(aq)
N2 O5(s) + H2 O(l) ⟶ 2HNO3(aq)
2. Those oxides such as NO2 and ClO2, in which the nonmetal does not exhibit one of its common oxidation
states, also react with water. In these reactions, the nonmetal is both oxidized and reduced. For example:
3NO2(g) + H2 O(l) ⟶ 2HNO3(aq) + NO(g)
+4 +5 +2
Reactions in which the same element is both oxidized and reduced are called disproportionation reactions.
3. The acid strength increases as the electronegativity of the central atom increases. To learn more, see the
discussion in the chapter on acid-base chemistry.
The binary hydrogen compounds of the nonmetals also exhibit an acidic behavior in water, although only HCl, HBr,
and HI are strong acids. The acid strength of the nonmetal hydrogen compounds increases from left to right across
a period and down a group. For example, ammonia, NH3, is a weaker acid than is water, H2O, which is weaker than
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 965
is hydrogen fluoride, HF. Water, H2O, is also a weaker acid than is hydrogen sulfide, H2S, which is weaker than is
hydrogen selenide, H2Se. Weaker acidic character implies greater basic character.
Structures of the Nonmetals
The structures of the nonmetals differ dramatically from those of metals. Metals crystallize in closely packed arrays
that do not contain molecules or covalent bonds. Nonmetal structures contain covalent bonds, and many nonmetals
consist of individual molecules. The electrons in nonmetals are localized in covalent bonds, whereas in a metal, there
is delocalization of the electrons throughout the solid.
The noble gases are all monatomic, whereas the other nonmetal gases—hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and
chlorine—normally exist as the diatomic molecules H2, N2, O2, F2, and Cl2. The other halogens are also diatomic;
Br2 is a liquid and I2 exists as a solid under normal conditions. The changes in state as one moves down the halogen
family offer excellent examples of the increasing strength of intermolecular London forces with increasing molecular
mass and increasing polarizability.
Oxygen has two allotropes: O2, dioxygen, and O3, ozone. Phosphorus has three common allotropes, commonly
referred to by their colors: white, red, and black. Sulfur has several allotropes. There are also many carbon allotropes.
Most people know of diamond, graphite, and charcoal, but fewer people know of the recent discovery of fullerenes,
carbon nanotubes, and graphene.
Descriptions of the physical properties of three nonmetals that are characteristic of molecular solids follow.
Carbon
Carbon occurs in the uncombined (elemental) state in many forms, such as diamond, graphite, charcoal, coke, carbon
black, graphene, and fullerene.
Diamond, shown in Figure 18.20, is a very hard crystalline material that is colorless and transparent when pure.
Each atom forms four single bonds to four other atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron (sp3 hybridization); this makes
the diamond a giant molecule. Carbon-carbon single bonds are very strong, and, because they extend throughout the
crystal to form a three-dimensional network, the crystals are very hard and have high melting points (~4400 °C).
Figure 18.20 (a) Diamond and (b) graphite are two forms of carbon. (c) In the crystal structure of diamond, the
covalent bonds form three-dimensional tetrahedrons. (d) In the crystal structure of graphite, each planar layer is
composed of six-membered rings. (credit a: modification of work by “Fancy Diamonds”/Flickr; credit b: modification of
work from http://images-of-elements.com/carbon.php)
Graphite, also shown in Figure 18.20, is a soft, slippery, grayish-black solid that conducts electricity. These
properties relate to its structure, which consists of layers of carbon atoms, with each atom surrounded by three
other carbon atoms in a trigonal planar arrangement. Each carbon atom in graphite forms three σ bonds, one to
each of its nearest neighbors, by means of sp2-hybrid orbitals. The unhybridized p orbital on each carbon atom will
overlap unhybridized orbitals on adjacent carbon atoms in the same layer to form π bonds. Many resonance forms are
966 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
necessary to describe the electronic structure of a graphite layer; Figure 18.21 illustrates two of these forms.
Figure 18.21 (a) Carbon atoms in graphite have unhybridized p orbitals. Each p orbital is perpendicular to the plane
of carbon atoms. (b) These are two of the many resonance forms of graphite necessary to describe its electronic
structure as a resonance hybrid.
Atoms within a graphite layer are bonded together tightly by the σ and π bonds; however, the forces between layers
are weak. London dispersion forces hold the layers together. To learn more, see the discussion of these weak forces in
the chapter on liquids and solids. The weak forces between layers give graphite the soft, flaky character that makes it
useful as the so-called “lead” in pencils and the slippery character that makes it useful as a lubricant. The loosely held
electrons in the resonating π bonds can move throughout the solid and are responsible for the electrical conductivity
of graphite.
Other forms of elemental carbon include carbon black, charcoal, and coke. Carbon black is an amorphous form of
carbon prepared by the incomplete combustion of natural gas, CH4. It is possible to produce charcoal and coke by
heating wood and coal, respectively, at high temperatures in the absence of air.
Recently, new forms of elemental carbon molecules have been identified in the soot generated by a smoky flame and
in the vapor produced when graphite is heated to very high temperatures in a vacuum or in helium. One of these new
forms, first isolated by Professor Richard Smalley and coworkers at Rice University, consists of icosahedral (soccer-
ball-shaped) molecules that contain 60 carbon atoms, C60. This is buckminsterfullerene (often called bucky balls)
after the architect Buckminster Fuller, who designed domed structures, which have a similar appearance (Figure
18.22).
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 967
Figure 18.22 The molecular structure of C60, buckminsterfullerene, is icosahedral.
Nanotubes and Graphene
Graphene and carbon nanotubes are two recently discovered allotropes of carbon. Both of the forms bear
some relationship to graphite. Graphene is a single layer of graphite (one atom thick), as illustrated in Figure
18.23, whereas carbon nanotubes roll the layer into a small tube, as illustrated in Figure 18.23.
Figure 18.23 (a) Graphene and (b) carbon nanotubes are both allotropes of carbon.
Chemistry in Everyday Life

Graphene is a very strong, lightweight, and efficient conductor of heat and electricity discovered in 2003. As
in graphite, the carbon atoms form a layer of six-membered rings with sp2-hybridized carbon atoms at the
corners. Resonance stabilizes the system and leads to its conductivity. Unlike graphite, there is no stacking
of the layers to give a three-dimensional structure. Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov at the University of
Manchester won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics for their pioneering work characterizing graphene.
The simplest procedure for preparing graphene is to use a piece of adhesive tape to remove a single layer
of graphene from the surface of a piece of graphite. This method works because there are only weak London
dispersion forces between the layers in graphite. Alternative methods are to deposit a single layer of carbon
atoms on the surface of some other material (ruthenium, iridium, or copper) or to synthesize it at the surface of
silicon carbide via the sublimation of silicon.
There currently are no commercial applications of graphene. However, its unusual properties, such as high
electron mobility and thermal conductivity, should make it suitable for the manufacture of many advanced
electronic devices and for thermal management applications.
Carbon nanotubes are carbon allotropes, which have a cylindrical structure. Like graphite and graphene,
nanotubes consist of rings of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms. Unlike graphite and graphene, which occur in
layers, the layers wrap into a tube and bond together to produce a stable structure. The walls of the tube may
be one atom or multiple atoms thick.
Carbon nanotubes are extremely strong materials that are harder than diamond. Depending upon the shape
of the nanotube, it may be a conductor or semiconductor. For some applications, the conducting form is
preferable, whereas other applications utilize the semiconducting form.
The basis for the synthesis of carbon nanotubes is the generation of carbon atoms in a vacuum. It is possible
to produce carbon atoms by an electrical discharge through graphite, vaporization of graphite with a laser, and
the decomposition of a carbon compound.
The strength of carbon nanotubes will eventually lead to some of their most exciting applications, as a thread
produced from several nanotubes will support enormous weight. However, the current applications only employ
bulk nanotubes. The addition of nanotubes to polymers improves the mechanical, thermal, and electrical
properties of the bulk material. There are currently nanotubes in some bicycle parts, skis, baseball bats, fishing
rods, and surfboards.
Phosphorus
The name phosphorus comes from the Greek words meaning light bringing. When phosphorus was first isolated,
scientists noted that it glowed in the dark and burned when exposed to air. Phosphorus is the only member of its group
that does not occur in the uncombined state in nature; it exists in many allotropic forms. We will consider two of those
forms: white phosphorus and red phosphorus.
White phosphorus is a white, waxy solid that melts at 44.2 °C and boils at 280 °C. It is insoluble in water (in which it
is stored—see Figure 18.24), is very soluble in carbon disulfide, and bursts into flame in air. As a solid, as a liquid,
as a gas, and in solution, white phosphorus exists as P4 molecules with four phosphorus atoms at the corners of a
regular tetrahedron, as illustrated in Figure 18.24. Each phosphorus atom covalently bonds to the other three atoms
in the molecule by single covalent bonds. White phosphorus is the most reactive allotrope and is very toxic.
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 969
Figure 18.24 (a) Because white phosphorus bursts into flame in air, it is stored in water. (b) The structure of white
phosphorus consists of P4 molecules arranged in a tetrahedron. (c) Red phosphorus is much less reactive than is
white phosphorus. (d) The structure of red phosphorus consists of networks of P4 tetrahedra joined by P-P single
bonds. (credit a: modification of work from http://images-of-elements.com/phosphorus.php)
Heating white phosphorus to 270–300 °C in the absence of air yields red phosphorus. Red phosphorus (shown in
Figure 18.24) is denser, has a higher melting point (~600 °C), is much less reactive, is essentially nontoxic, and is
easier and safer to handle than is white phosphorus. Its structure is highly polymeric and appears to contain three-
dimensional networks of P4 tetrahedra joined by P-P single bonds. Red phosphorus is insoluble in solvents that
dissolve white phosphorus. When red phosphorus is heated, P4 molecules sublime from the solid.
Sulfur
The allotropy of sulfur is far greater and more complex than that of any other element. Sulfur is the brimstone referred
to in the Bible and other places, and references to sulfur occur throughout recorded history—right up to the relatively
recent discovery that it is a component of the atmospheres of Venus and of Io, a moon of Jupiter. The most common
and most stable allotrope of sulfur is yellow, rhombic sulfur, so named because of the shape of its crystals. Rhombic
sulfur is the form to which all other allotropes revert at room temperature. Crystals of rhombic sulfur melt at 113 °C.
Cooling this liquid gives long needles of monoclinic sulfur. This form is stable from 96 °C to the melting point, 119
°C. At room temperature, it gradually reverts to the rhombic form.
Both rhombic sulfur and monoclinic sulfur contain S8 molecules in which atoms form eight-membered, puckered
rings that resemble crowns, as illustrated in Figure 18.25. Each sulfur atom is bonded to each of its two neighbors
in the ring by covalent S-S single bonds.

Figure 18.25 These four sulfur allotropes show eight-membered, puckered rings. Each sulfur atom bonds to each of
its two neighbors in the ring by covalent S-S single bonds. Here are (a) individual S8 rings, (b) S8 chains formed when
the rings open, (c) longer chains formed by adding sulfur atoms to S8 chains, and (d) part of the very long sulfur
chains formed at higher temperatures.
When rhombic sulfur melts, the straw-colored liquid is quite mobile; its viscosity is low because S8 molecules are
essentially spherical and offer relatively little resistance as they move past each other. As the temperature rises, S-S
bonds in the rings break, and polymeric chains of sulfur atoms result. These chains combine end to end, forming still
longer chains that tangle with one another. The liquid gradually darkens in color and becomes so viscous that finally
(at about 230 °C) it does not pour easily. The dangling atoms at the ends of the chains of sulfur atoms are responsible
for the dark red color because their electronic structure differs from those of sulfur atoms that have bonds to two
adjacent sulfur atoms. This causes them to absorb light differently and results in a different visible color. Cooling the
liquid rapidly produces a rubberlike amorphous mass, called plastic sulfur.
Sulfur boils at 445 °C and forms a vapor consisting of S2, S6, and S8 molecules; at about 1000 °C, the vapor density
corresponds to the formula S2, which is a paramagnetic molecule like O2 with a similar electronic structure and a
weak sulfur-sulfur double bond.
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 971
As seen in this discussion, an important feature of the structural behavior of the nonmetals is that the elements
usually occur with eight electrons in their valence shells. If necessary, the elements form enough covalent bonds to
supplement the electrons already present to possess an octet. For example, members of group 15 have five valence
electrons and require only three additional electrons to fill their valence shells. These elements form three covalent
bonds in their free state: triple bonds in the N2 molecule or single bonds to three different atoms in arsenic and
phosphorus. The elements of group 16 require only two additional electrons. Oxygen forms a double bond in the O2
molecule, and sulfur, selenium, and tellurium form two single bonds in various rings and chains. The halogens form
diatomic molecules in which each atom is involved in only one bond. This provides the electron required necessary to
complete the octet on the halogen atom. The noble gases do not form covalent bonds to other noble gas atoms because
they already have a filled outer shell.
18.5 Occurrence, Preparation, and Compounds of
Hydrogen
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the properties, preparation, and compounds of hydrogen
Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. The sun and other stars are composed largely of hydrogen.
Astronomers estimate that 90% of the atoms in the universe are hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen is a component of more
compounds than any other element. Water is the most abundant compound of hydrogen found on earth. Hydrogen is
an important part of petroleum, many minerals, cellulose and starch, sugar, fats, oils, alcohols, acids, and thousands
of other substances.
At ordinary temperatures, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and nonpoisonous gas consisting of the diatomic
molecule H2. Hydrogen is composed of three isotopes, and unlike other elements, these isotopes have different names
and chemical symbols: protium, 1H, deuterium, 2H (or “D”), and tritium 3H (or “T”). In a naturally occurring sample
of hydrogen, there is one atom of deuterium for every 7000 H atoms and one atom of radioactive tritium for every
1018 H atoms. The chemical properties of the different isotopes are very similar because they have identical electron
structures, but they differ in some physical properties because of their differing atomic masses. Elemental deuterium
and tritium have lower vapor pressure than ordinary hydrogen. Consequently, when liquid hydrogen evaporates, the
heavier isotopes are concentrated in the last portions to evaporate. Electrolysis of heavy water, D2O, yields deuterium.
Most tritium originates from nuclear reactions.
Preparation of Hydrogen
Elemental hydrogen must be prepared from compounds by breaking chemical bonds. The most common methods of
preparing hydrogen follow.
From Steam and Carbon or Hydrocarbons
Water is the cheapest and most abundant source of hydrogen. Passing steam over coke (an impure form of elemental
carbon) at 1000 °C produces a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen known as water gas:
C(s) + H2 O(g) →⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯
1000 °C CO(g) + H2(g)
water gas
Water gas is as an industrial fuel. It is possible to produce additional hydrogen by mixing the water gas with steam in
the presence of a catalyst to convert the CO to CO2. This reaction is the water gas shift reaction.
It is also possible to prepare a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide by passing hydrocarbons from natural gas
or petroleum and steam over a nickel-based catalyst. Propane is an example of a hydrocarbon reactant:
972 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
C3 H8(g) + 3H2 O(g) →⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯
catalyst
900 °C 3CO(g) + 7H2(g)
Electrolysis
Hydrogen forms when direct current electricity passes through water containing an electrolyte such as H2SO4, as
illustrated in Figure 18.26. Bubbles of hydrogen form at the cathode, and oxygen evolves at the anode. The net
reaction is:
2H2 O(l) + electrical energy ⟶ 2H2(g) + O2(g)
Figure 18.26 The electrolysis of water produces hydrogen and oxygen. Because there are twice as many hydrogen
atoms as oxygen atoms and both elements are diatomic, there is twice the volume of hydrogen produced at the
cathode as there is oxygen produced at the anode.
Reaction of Metals with Acids
This is the most convenient laboratory method of producing hydrogen. Metals with lower reduction potentials reduce
the hydrogen ion in dilute acids to produce hydrogen gas and metal salts. For example, as shown in Figure 18.27,
iron in dilute hydrochloric acid produces hydrogen gas and iron(II) chloride:
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 973
Fe(s) + 2H3 O+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq) ⟶ Fe2+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq) + H2(g) + 2H2 O(l)
Figure 18.27 The reaction of iron with an acid produces hydrogen. Here, iron reacts with hydrochloric acid. (credit:
Mark Ott)
Reaction of Ionic Metal Hydrides with Water
It is possible to produce hydrogen from the reaction of hydrides of the active metals, which contain the very strongly
basic H− anion, with water:
CaH2(s) + 2H2 O(l) ⟶ Ca2+(aq) + 2OH−(aq) + 2H2(g)
Metal hydrides are expensive but convenient sources of hydrogen, especially where space and weight are important
factors. They are important in the inflation of life jackets, life rafts, and military balloons.
Reactions
Under normal conditions, hydrogen is relatively inactive chemically, but when heated, it enters into many chemical
reactions.
Two thirds of the world’s hydrogen production is devoted to the manufacture of ammonia, which is a fertilizer
and used in the manufacture of nitric acid. Large quantities of hydrogen are also important in the process of
hydrogenation, discussed in the chapter on organic chemistry.
It is possible to use hydrogen as a nonpolluting fuel. The reaction of hydrogen with oxygen is a very exothermic
reaction, releasing 286 kJ of energy per mole of water formed. Hydrogen burns without explosion under controlled
conditions. The oxygen-hydrogen torch, because of the high heat of combustion of hydrogen, can achieve
temperatures up to 2800 °C. The hot flame of this torch is useful in cutting thick sheets of many metals. Liquid
hydrogen is also an important rocket fuel (Figure 18.28).

Figure 18.28 Before the fleet’s retirement in 2011, liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were used in the three main
engines of a space shuttle. Two compartments in the large tank held these liquids until the shuttle was launched.

An uncombined hydrogen atom consists of a nucleus and one valence electron in the 1s orbital. The n = 1 valence
shell has a capacity for two electrons, and hydrogen can rightfully occupy two locations in the periodic table. It is
possible to consider hydrogen a group 1 element because hydrogen can lose an electron to form the cation, H+. It
is also possible to consider hydrogen to be a group 17 element because it needs only one electron to fill its valence
orbital to form a hydride ion, H−, or it can share an electron to form a single, covalent bond. In reality, hydrogen is a
unique element that almost deserves its own location in the periodic table.
Reactions with Elements
When heated, hydrogen reacts with the metals of group 1 and with Ca, Sr, and Ba (the more active metals in group
2). The compounds formed are crystalline, ionic hydrides that contain the hydride anion, H−, a strong reducing agent
and a strong base, which reacts vigorously with water and other acids to form hydrogen gas.
The reactions of hydrogen with nonmetals generally produce acidic hydrogen compounds with hydrogen in the
1+ oxidation state. The reactions become more exothermic and vigorous as the electronegativity of the nonmetal
increases. Hydrogen reacts with nitrogen and sulfur only when heated, but it reacts explosively with fluorine (forming
HF) and, under some conditions, with chlorine (forming HCl). A mixture of hydrogen and oxygen explodes if ignited.
Because of the explosive nature of the reaction, it is necessary to exercise caution when handling hydrogen (or any
other combustible gas) to avoid the formation of an explosive mixture in a confined space. Although most hydrides
of the nonmetals are acidic, ammonia and phosphine (PH3) are very, very weak acids and generally function as bases.
There is a summary of these reactions of hydrogen with the elements in Table 18.1.

Reaction with Compounds
Hydrogen reduces the heated oxides of many metals, with the formation of the metal and water vapor. For example,
passing hydrogen over heated CuO forms copper and water.
Hydrogen may also reduce the metal ions in some metal oxides to lower oxidation states:
H2(g) + MnO2(s) →⎯⎯
Δ MnO(s) + H2 O(g)
Hydrogen Compounds
Other than the noble gases, each of the nonmetals forms compounds with hydrogen. For brevity, we will discuss only
a few hydrogen compounds of the nonmetals here.
Nitrogen Hydrogen Compounds
Ammonia, NH3, forms naturally when any nitrogen-containing organic material decomposes in the absence of air.
The laboratory preparation of ammonia is by the reaction of an ammonium salt with a strong base such as sodium
hydroxide. The acid-base reaction with the weakly acidic ammonium ion gives ammonia, illustrated in Figure 18.29.
Ammonia also forms when ionic nitrides react with water. The nitride ion is a much stronger base than the hydroxide
ion:
Mg3 N2(s) + 6H2 O(l) ⟶ 3Mg(OH)2(s) + 2NH3(g)
The commercial production of ammonia is by the direct combination of the elements in the Haber process:
N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌
catalyst
2NH3(g) ΔH° = −92 kJ
Figure 18.29 The structure of ammonia is shown with a central nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms.
Ammonia is a colorless gas with a sharp, pungent odor. Smelling salts utilize this powerful odor. Gaseous ammonia
readily liquefies to give a colorless liquid that boils at −33 °C. Due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding, the enthalpy
of vaporization of liquid ammonia is higher than that of any other liquid except water, so ammonia is useful as a
refrigerant. Ammonia is quite soluble in water (658 L at STP dissolves in 1 L H2O).
The chemical properties of ammonia are as follows:
1. Ammonia acts as a Brønsted base, as discussed in the chapter on acid-base chemistry. The ammonium ion is
similar in size to the potassium ion; compounds of the two ions exhibit many similarities in their structures
and solubilities.
2. Ammonia can display acidic behavior, although it is a much weaker acid than water. Like other acids,
ammonia reacts with metals, although it is so weak that high temperatures are necessary. Hydrogen and
976 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals

(depending on the stoichiometry) amides (salts of NH2 −), imides (salts of NH2−), or nitrides (salts of N3−)
form.
3. The nitrogen atom in ammonia has its lowest possible oxidation state (3−) and thus is not susceptible to
reduction. However, it can be oxidized. Ammonia burns in air, giving NO and water. Hot ammonia and the
ammonium ion are active reducing agents. Of particular interest are the oxidations of ammonium ion by nitrite
ion, NO2 −, to yield pure nitrogen and by nitrate ion to yield nitrous oxide, N2O.
4. There are a number of compounds that we can consider derivatives of ammonia through the replacement
of one or more hydrogen atoms with some other atom or group of atoms. Inorganic derivations include
chloramine, NH2Cl, and hydrazine, N2H4:
Chloramine, NH2Cl, results from the reaction of sodium hypochlorite, NaOCl, with ammonia in basic solution. In the
presence of a large excess of ammonia at low temperature, the chloramine reacts further to produce hydrazine, N2H4:
NH3(aq) + OCl−(aq) ⟶ NH2 Cl(aq) + OH−(aq)
NH2 Cl(aq) + NH3(aq) + OH−(aq) ⟶ N2 H4(aq) + Cl−(aq) + H2 O(l)
Anhydrous hydrazine is relatively stable in spite of its positive free energy of formation:
N2(g) + 2H2(g) ⟶ N2 H4(l) ΔGf° = 149.2 kJ mol−1
Hydrazine is a fuming, colorless liquid that has some physical properties remarkably similar to those of H2O (it melts
at 2 °C, boils at 113.5 °C, and has a density at 25 °C of 1.00 g/mL). It burns rapidly and completely in air with
substantial evolution of heat:
N2 H4(l) + O2(g) ⟶ N2(g) + 2H2 O(l) ΔH° = −621.5 kJ mol−1
Like ammonia, hydrazine is both a Brønsted base and a Lewis base, although it is weaker than ammonia. It reacts with
strong acids and forms two series of salts that contain the N2 H5 + and N2 H6 2+ ions, respectively. Some rockets
use hydrazine as a fuel.
Phosphorus Hydrogen Compounds
The most important hydride of phosphorus is phosphine, PH3, a gaseous analog of ammonia in terms of both formula
and structure. Unlike ammonia, it is not possible to form phosphine by direct union of the elements. There are
two methods for the preparation of phosphine. One method is by the action of an acid on an ionic phosphide. The
other method is the disproportionation of white phosphorus with hot concentrated base to produce phosphine and the
hydrogen phosphite ion:
AlP(s) + 3H3 O+(aq) ⟶ PH3(g) + Al3+(aq) + 3H2 O(l)
P4(s) + 4OH−(aq) + 2H2 O(l) ⟶ 2HPO3 2−(aq) + 2PH3(g)
Phosphine is a colorless, very poisonous gas, which has an odor like that of decaying fish. Heat easily decomposes
phosphine (4PH3 ⟶ P4 + 6H2), and the compound burns in air. The major uses of phosphine are as a fumigant
for grains and in semiconductor processing. Like ammonia, gaseous phosphine unites with gaseous hydrogen halides,
forming phosphonium compounds like PH4Cl and PH4I. Phosphine is a much weaker base than ammonia; therefore,
these compounds decompose in water, and the insoluble PH3 escapes from solution.
Sulfur Hydrogen Compounds
Hydrogen sulfide, H2S, is a colorless gas that is responsible for the offensive odor of rotten eggs and of many hot
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 977
springs. Hydrogen sulfide is as toxic as hydrogen cyanide; therefore, it is necessary to exercise great care in handling
it. Hydrogen sulfide is particularly deceptive because it paralyzes the olfactory nerves; after a short exposure, one
does not smell it.
The production of hydrogen sulfide by the direct reaction of the elements (H2 + S) is unsatisfactory because the yield
is low. A more effective preparation method is the reaction of a metal sulfide with a dilute acid. For example:
FeS(s) + 2H3 O+(aq) ⟶ Fe2+(aq) + H2 S(g) + 2H2 O(l)
It is easy to oxidize the sulfur in metal sulfides and in hydrogen sulfide, making metal sulfides and H2S good reducing
agents. In acidic solutions, hydrogen sulfide reduces Fe3+ to Fe2+, MnO4 − to Mn2+, Cr2 O7 2− to Cr3+, and HNO3
to NO2. The sulfur in H2S usually oxidizes to elemental sulfur, unless a large excess of the oxidizing agent is present.
In which case, the sulfide may oxidize to SO3 2− or SO4 2− (or to SO2 or SO3 in the absence of water):
2H2 S(g) + O2(g) ⟶ 2S(s) + 2H2 O(l)
This oxidation process leads to the removal of the hydrogen sulfide found in many sources of natural gas. The deposits
of sulfur in volcanic regions may be the result of the oxidation of H2S present in volcanic gases.
Hydrogen sulfide is a weak diprotic acid that dissolves in water to form hydrosulfuric acid. The acid ionizes in two
stages, yielding hydrogen sulfide ions, HS−, in the first stage and sulfide ions, S2−, in the second. Since hydrogen
sulfide is a weak acid, aqueous solutions of soluble sulfides and hydrogen sulfides are basic:
S2−(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ HS−(aq) + OH−(aq)
HS−(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ H2 S(g) + OH−(aq)
Halogen Hydrogen Compounds
Binary compounds containing only hydrogen and a halogen are hydrogen halides. At room temperature, the pure
hydrogen halides HF, HCl, HBr, and HI are gases.
In general, it is possible to prepare the halides by the general techniques used to prepare other acids. Fluorine,
chlorine, and bromine react directly with hydrogen to form the respective hydrogen halide. This is a commercially
important reaction for preparing hydrogen chloride and hydrogen bromide.
The acid-base reaction between a nonvolatile strong acid and a metal halide will yield a hydrogen halide. The
escape of the gaseous hydrogen halide drives the reaction to completion. For example, the usual method of preparing
hydrogen fluoride is by heating a mixture of calcium fluoride, CaF2, and concentrated sulfuric acid:
CaF2(s) + H2 SO4(aq) ⟶ CaSO4(s) + 2HF(g)
Gaseous hydrogen fluoride is also a by-product in the preparation of phosphate fertilizers by the reaction of
fluoroapatite, Ca5(PO4)3F, with sulfuric acid. The reaction of concentrated sulfuric acid with a chloride salt produces
hydrogen chloride both commercially and in the laboratory.
In most cases, sodium chloride is the chloride of choice because it is the least expensive chloride. Hydrogen bromide
and hydrogen iodide cannot be prepared using sulfuric acid because this acid is an oxidizing agent capable of
oxidizing both bromide and iodide. However, it is possible to prepare both hydrogen bromide and hydrogen iodide
using an acid such as phosphoric acid because it is a weaker oxidizing agent. For example:
H3 PO4(l) + Br−(aq) ⟶ HBr(g) + H2 PO4 −(aq)
All of the hydrogen halides are very soluble in water, forming hydrohalic acids. With the exception of hydrogen
fluoride, which has a strong hydrogen-fluoride bond, they are strong acids. Reactions of hydrohalic acids with metals,
metal hydroxides, oxides, or carbonates produce salts of the halides. Most chloride salts are soluble in water. AgCl,
PbCl2, and Hg2Cl2 are the commonly encountered exceptions.
The halide ions give the substances the properties associated with X−(aq). The heavier halide ions (Cl−, Br−, and I−)
can act as reducing agents, and the lighter halogens or other oxidizing agents will oxidize them:
978 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Cl2(aq) + 2e− ⟶ 2Cl−(aq) E° = 1.36 V
Br2(aq) + 2e− ⟶ 2Br−(aq) E° = 1.09 V
I2(aq) + 2e− ⟶ 2I−(aq) E° = 0.54 V
For example, bromine oxidizes iodine:
Br2(aq) + 2HI(aq) ⟶ 2HBr(aq) + I2(aq) E° = 0.55 V
Hydrofluoric acid is unique in its reactions with sand (silicon dioxide) and with glass, which is a mixture of silicates:
SiO2(s) + 4HF(aq) ⟶ SiF4(g) + 2H2 O(l)
CaSiO3(s) + 6HF(aq) ⟶ CaF2(s) + SiF4(g) + 3H2 O(l)
The volatile silicon tetrafluoride escapes from these reactions. Because hydrogen fluoride attacks glass, it can frost or
etch glass and is used to etch markings on thermometers, burets, and other glassware.
The largest use for hydrogen fluoride is in production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons for refrigerants, in plastics, and in
propellants. The second largest use is in the manufacture of cryolite, Na3AlF6, which is important in the production
of aluminum. The acid is also important in the production of other inorganic fluorides (such as BF3), which serve as
catalysts in the industrial synthesis of certain organic compounds.
Hydrochloric acid is relatively inexpensive. It is an important and versatile acid in industry and is important for
the manufacture of metal chlorides, dyes, glue, glucose, and various other chemicals. A considerable amount is
also important for the activation of oil wells and as pickle liquor—an acid used to remove oxide coating from iron
or steel that is to be galvanized, tinned, or enameled. The amounts of hydrobromic acid and hydroiodic acid used
commercially are insignificant by comparison.
18.6 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of
Carbonates
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the preparation, properties, and uses of some representative metal carbonates
The chemistry of carbon is extensive; however, most of this chemistry is not relevant to this chapter. The other aspects
of the chemistry of carbon will appear in the chapter covering organic chemistry. In this chapter, we will focus on the
carbonate ion and related substances. The metals of groups 1 and 2, as well as zinc, cadmium, mercury, and lead(II),
form ionic carbonates—compounds that contain the carbonate anions, CO3 2−. The metals of group 1, magnesium,
calcium, strontium, and barium also form hydrogen carbonates—compounds that contain the hydrogen carbonate
anion, HCO3 − , also known as the bicarbonate anion.
With the exception of magnesium carbonate, it is possible to prepare carbonates of the metals of groups 1 and 2 by
the reaction of carbon dioxide with the respective oxide or hydroxide. Examples of such reactions include:
Na2 O(s) + CO2(g) ⟶ Na2 CO3(s)
Ca(OH)2(s) + CO2(g) ⟶ CaCO3(s) + H2 O(l)
The carbonates of the alkaline earth metals of group 12 and lead(II) are not soluble. These carbonates precipitate upon
mixing a solution of soluble alkali metal carbonate with a solution of soluble salts of these metals. Examples of net
ionic equations for the reactions are:
Ca2+(aq) + CO3 2−(aq) ⟶ CaCO3(s)
Pb2+(aq) + CO3 2−(aq) ⟶ PbCO3(s)
Pearls and the shells of most mollusks are calcium carbonate. Tin(II) or one of the trivalent or tetravalent ions such
as Al3+ or Sn4+ behave differently in this reaction as carbon dioxide and the corresponding oxide form instead of the
carbonate.
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 979
Alkali metal hydrogen carbonates such as NaHCO3 and CsHCO3 form by saturating a solution of the hydroxides with
carbon dioxide. The net ionic reaction involves hydroxide ion and carbon dioxide:
OH−(aq) + CO2(aq) ⟶ HCO3 −(aq)
It is possible to isolate the solids by evaporation of the water from the solution.
Although they are insoluble in pure water, alkaline earth carbonates dissolve readily in water containing carbon
dioxide because hydrogen carbonate salts form. For example, caves and sinkholes form in limestone when CaCO3
dissolves in water containing dissolved carbon dioxide:
CaCO3(s) + CO2(aq) + H2 O(l) ⟶ Ca2+(aq) + 2HCO3 −(aq)
Hydrogen carbonates of the alkaline earth metals remain stable only in solution; evaporation of the solution produces
the carbonate. Stalactites and stalagmites, like those shown in Figure 18.30, form in caves when drops of water
containing dissolved calcium hydrogen carbonate evaporate to leave a deposit of calcium carbonate.
Figure 18.30 (a) Stalactites and (b) stalagmites are cave formations of calcium carbonate. (credit a: modification of
work by Arvind Govindaraj; credit b: modification of work by the National Park Service.)
The two carbonates used commercially in the largest quantities are sodium carbonate and calcium carbonate.
In the United States, sodium carbonate is extracted from the mineral trona, Na3(CO3)(HCO3)(H2O)2. Following
recrystallization to remove clay and other impurities, heating the recrystallized trona produces Na2CO3:
2Na3(CO3)(HCO3)(H2 O)2(s) ⟶ 3Na2 CO3(s) + 5H2 O(l) + CO2(g)
Carbonates are moderately strong bases. Aqueous solutions are basic because the carbonate ion accepts hydrogen ion
from water in this reversible reaction:
CO3 2−(aq) + H2 O(l) ⇌ HCO3 −(aq) + OH−(aq)
Carbonates react with acids to form salts of the metal, gaseous carbon dioxide, and water. The reaction of calcium
carbonate, the active ingredient of the antacid Tums, with hydrochloric acid (stomach acid), as shown in Figure
18.31, illustrates the reaction:
980 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals

CaCO3(s) + 2HCl(aq) ⟶ CaCl2(aq) + CO2(g) + H2 O(l)
Figure 18.31 The reaction of calcium carbonate with hydrochloric acid is shown. (credit: Mark Ott)
Other applications of carbonates include glass making—where carbonate ions serve as a source of oxide ions—and
synthesis of oxides.
Hydrogen carbonates are amphoteric because they act as both weak acids and weak bases. Hydrogen carbonate ions
act as acids and react with solutions of soluble hydroxides to form a carbonate and water:
KHCO3(aq) + KOH(aq) ⟶ K2 CO3(aq) + H2 O(l)
With acids, hydrogen carbonates form a salt, carbon dioxide, and water. Baking soda (bicarbonate of soda or sodium
bicarbonate) is sodium hydrogen carbonate. Baking powder contains baking soda and a solid acid such as potassium
hydrogen tartrate (cream of tartar), KHC4H4O6. As long as the powder is dry, no reaction occurs; immediately after
the addition of water, the acid reacts with the hydrogen carbonate ions to form carbon dioxide:
HC4 H4 O6 −(aq) + HCO3 −(aq) ⟶ C4 H4 O6 2−(aq) + CO2(g) + H2 O(l)
Dough will trap the carbon dioxide, causing it to expand during baking, producing the characteristic texture of baked
goods.
18.7 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Nitrogen
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the properties, preparation, and uses of nitrogen
Most pure nitrogen comes from the fractional distillation of liquid air. The atmosphere consists of 78% nitrogen by
volume. This means there are more than 20 million tons of nitrogen over every square mile of the earth’s surface.
Nitrogen is a component of proteins and of the genetic material (DNA/RNA) of all plants and animals.
Under ordinary conditions, nitrogen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas. It boils at 77 K and freezes at 63 K.
Liquid nitrogen is a useful coolant because it is inexpensive and has a low boiling point. Nitrogen is very unreactive
because of the very strong triple bond between the nitrogen atoms. The only common reactions at room temperature
occur with lithium to form Li3N, with certain transition metal complexes, and with hydrogen or oxygen in nitrogen-
fixing bacteria. The general lack of reactivity of nitrogen makes the remarkable ability of some bacteria to synthesize
nitrogen compounds using atmospheric nitrogen gas as the source one of the most exciting chemical events on our
planet. This process is one type of nitrogen fixation. In this case, nitrogen fixation is the process where organisms
convert atmospheric nitrogen into biologically useful chemicals. Nitrogen fixation also occurs when lightning passes
through air, causing molecular nitrogen to react with oxygen to form nitrogen oxides, which are then carried down to
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 981
the soil.
Nitrogen Fixation
All living organisms require nitrogen compounds for survival. Unfortunately, most of these organisms cannot
absorb nitrogen from its most abundant source—the atmosphere. Atmospheric nitrogen consists of N2
molecules, which are very unreactive due to the strong nitrogen-nitrogen triple bond. However, a few
organisms can overcome this problem through a process known as nitrogen fixation, illustrated in Figure
18.32.
Figure 18.32 All living organisms require nitrogen. A few microorganisms are able to process atmospheric
nitrogen using nitrogen fixation. (credit “roots”: modification of work by the United States Department of
Agriculture; credit “root nodules”: modification of work by Louisa Howard)
Nitrogen fixation is the process where organisms convert atmospheric nitrogen into biologically useful
chemicals. To date, the only known kind of biological organisms capable of nitrogen fixation are

microorganisms. These organisms employ enzymes called nitrogenases, which contain iron and molybdenum.
Many of these microorganisms live in a symbiotic relationship with plants, with the best-known example being
the presence of rhizobia in the root nodules of legumes.
Large volumes of atmospheric nitrogen are necessary for making ammonia—the principal starting material used
for preparation of large quantities of other nitrogen-containing compounds. Most other uses for elemental nitrogen
depend on its inactivity. It is helpful when a chemical process requires an inert atmosphere. Canned foods and
luncheon meats cannot oxidize in a pure nitrogen atmosphere, so they retain a better flavor and color, and spoil less
rapidly, when sealed in nitrogen instead of air. This technology allows fresh produce to be available year-round,
regardless of growing season.
There are compounds with nitrogen in all of its oxidation states from 3− to 5+. Much of the chemistry of nitrogen
involves oxidation-reduction reactions. Some active metals (such as alkali metals and alkaline earth metals) can
reduce nitrogen to form metal nitrides. In the remainder of this section, we will examine nitrogen-oxygen chemistry.
There are well-characterized nitrogen oxides in which nitrogen exhibits each of its positive oxidation numbers from
1+ to 5+. When ammonium nitrate is carefully heated, nitrous oxide (dinitrogen oxide) and water vapor form.
Stronger heating generates nitrogen gas, oxygen gas, and water vapor. No one should ever attempt this reaction—it
can be very explosive. In 1947, there was a major ammonium nitrate explosion in Texas City, Texas, and, in 2013,
there was another major explosion in West, Texas. In the last 100 years, there were nearly 30 similar disasters
worldwide, resulting in the loss of numerous lives. In this oxidation-reduction reaction, the nitrogen in the nitrate ion
oxidizes the nitrogen in the ammonium ion. Nitrous oxide, shown in Figure 18.33, is a colorless gas possessing a
mild, pleasing odor and a sweet taste. It finds application as an anesthetic for minor operations, especially in dentistry,
under the name “laughing gas.”
Figure 18.33 Nitrous oxide, N2O, is an anesthetic that has these molecular (left) and resonance (right) structures.
Low yields of nitric oxide, NO, form when heating nitrogen and oxygen together. NO also forms when lightning
passes through air during thunderstorms. Burning ammonia is the commercial method of preparing nitric oxide. In the
laboratory, the reduction of nitric acid is the best method for preparing nitric oxide. When copper reacts with dilute
nitric acid, nitric oxide is the principal reduction product:
3Cu(s) + 8HNO3(aq) ⟶ 2NO(g) + 3Cu(NO3)2(aq) + 4H2 O(l)
Gaseous nitric oxide is the most thermally stable of the nitrogen oxides and is the simplest known thermally stable
molecule with an unpaired electron. It is one of the air pollutants generated by internal combustion engines, resulting
from the reaction of atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen during the combustion process.
At room temperature, nitric oxide is a colorless gas consisting of diatomic molecules. As is often the case with
molecules that contain an unpaired electron, two molecules combine to form a dimer by pairing their unpaired
electrons to form a bond. Liquid and solid NO both contain N2O2 dimers, like that shown in Figure 18.34. Most
substances with unpaired electrons exhibit color by absorbing visible light; however, NO is colorless because the
absorption of light is not in the visible region of the spectrum.
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 983
Figure 18.34 This shows the equilibrium between NO and N2O2. The molecule, N2O2, absorbs light.
Cooling a mixture of equal parts nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide to −21 °C produces dinitrogen trioxide, a blue
liquid consisting of N2O3 molecules (shown in Figure 18.35). Dinitrogen trioxide exists only in the liquid and solid
states. When heated, it reverts to a mixture of NO and NO2.
Figure 18.35 Dinitrogen trioxide, N2O3, only exists in liquid or solid states and has these molecular (left) and
resonance (right) structures.
It is possible to prepare nitrogen dioxide in the laboratory by heating the nitrate of a heavy metal, or by the reduction
of concentrated nitric acid with copper metal, as shown in Figure 18.36. Commercially, it is possible to prepare
nitrogen dioxide by oxidizing nitric oxide with air.
Figure 18.36 The reaction of copper metal with concentrated HNO3 produces a solution of Cu(NO3)2 and brown
fumes of NO2. (credit: modification of work by Mark Ott)
The nitrogen dioxide molecule (illustrated in Figure 18.37) contains an unpaired electron, which is responsible
for its color and paramagnetism. It is also responsible for the dimerization of NO2. At low pressures or at high
temperatures, nitrogen dioxide has a deep brown color that is due to the presence of the NO2 molecule. At low
temperatures, the color almost entirely disappears as dinitrogen tetraoxide, N2O4, forms. At room temperature, an
equilibrium exists:
984 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
2NO2(g) ⇌ N2 O4(g) KP = 6.86
Figure 18.37 The molecular and resonance structures for nitrogen dioxide (NO2, left) and dinitrogen tetraoxide
(N2O4, right) are shown.
Dinitrogen pentaoxide, N2O5 (illustrated in Figure 18.38), is a white solid that is formed by the dehydration of nitric
acid by phosphorus(V) oxide (tetraphosphorus decoxide):
P4 O10(s) + 4HNO3(l) ⟶ 4HPO3(s) + 2N2 O5(s)
It is unstable above room temperature, decomposing to N2O4 and O2.
Figure 18.38 This image shows the molecular structure and one resonance structure of a molecule of dinitrogen
pentaoxide, N2O5.
The oxides of nitrogen(III), nitrogen(IV), and nitrogen(V) react with water and form nitrogen-containing oxyacids.
Nitrogen(III) oxide, N2O3, is the anhydride of nitrous acid; HNO2 forms when N2O3 reacts with water. There
are no stable oxyacids containing nitrogen with an oxidation state of 4+; therefore, nitrogen(IV) oxide, NO2,
disproportionates in one of two ways when it reacts with water. In cold water, a mixture of HNO2 and HNO3 forms.
At higher temperatures, HNO3 and NO will form. Nitrogen(V) oxide, N2O5, is the anhydride of nitric acid; HNO3 is
produced when N2O5 reacts with water:
N2 O5(s) + H2 O(l) ⟶ 2HNO3(aq)
The nitrogen oxides exhibit extensive oxidation-reduction behavior. Nitrous oxide resembles oxygen in its behavior
when heated with combustible substances. N2O is a strong oxidizing agent that decomposes when heated to form
nitrogen and oxygen. Because one-third of the gas liberated is oxygen, nitrous oxide supports combustion better than
air (one-fifth oxygen). A glowing splinter bursts into flame when thrust into a bottle of this gas. Nitric oxide acts both
as an oxidizing agent and as a reducing agent. For example:
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 985
oxidizing agent: P4(s) + 6NO(g) ⟶ P4 O6(s) + 3N2(g)
reducing agent: Cl2(g) + 2NO(g) ⟶ 2ClNO(g)
Nitrogen dioxide (or dinitrogen tetraoxide) is a good oxidizing agent. For example:
NO2(g) + CO(g) ⟶ NO(g) + CO2(g)
NO2(g) + 2HCl(aq) ⟶ NO(g) + Cl2(g) + H2 O(l)
18.8 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of
Phosphorus
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the properties, preparation, and uses of phosphorus
The industrial preparation of phosphorus is by heating calcium phosphate, obtained from phosphate rock, with sand
and coke:
2Ca3 (PO4)2(s) + 6SiO2(s) + 10C(s) →⎯⎯
Δ 6CaSiO3(l) + 10CO(g) + P4(g)
The phosphorus distills out of the furnace and is condensed into a solid or burned to form P4O10. The preparation of
many other phosphorus compounds begins with P4O10. The acids and phosphates are useful as fertilizers and in the
chemical industry. Other uses are in the manufacture of special alloys such as ferrophosphorus and phosphor bronze.
Phosphorus is important in making pesticides, matches, and some plastics. Phosphorus is an active nonmetal. In
compounds, phosphorus usually occurs in oxidation states of 3−, 3+, and 5+. Phosphorus exhibits oxidation numbers
that are unusual for a group 15 element in compounds that contain phosphorus-phosphorus bonds; examples include
diphosphorus tetrahydride, H2P-PH2, and tetraphosphorus trisulfide, P4S3, illustrated in Figure 18.39.
Figure 18.39 P4S3 is a component of the heads of strike-anywhere matches.
Phosphorus Oxygen Compounds
Phosphorus forms two common oxides, phosphorus(III) oxide (or tetraphosphorus hexaoxide), P4O6, and
phosphorus(V) oxide (or tetraphosphorus decaoxide), P4O10, both shown in Figure 18.40. Phosphorus(III) oxide is
a white crystalline solid with a garlic-like odor. Its vapor is very poisonous. It oxidizes slowly in air and inflames
when heated to 70 °C, forming P4O10. Phosphorus(III) oxide dissolves slowly in cold water to form phosphorous acid,
H3PO3.
986 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Figure 18.40 This image shows the molecular structures of P4O6 (left) and P4O10 (right).
Phosphorus(V) oxide, P4O10, is a white powder that is prepared by burning phosphorus in excess oxygen. Its enthalpy
of formation is very high (−2984 kJ), and it is quite stable and a very poor oxidizing agent. Dropping P4O10 into water
produces a hissing sound, heat, and orthophosphoric acid:
P4 O10(s) + 6H2 O(l) ⟶ 4H3 PO4(aq)
Because of its great affinity for water, phosphorus(V) oxide is an excellent drying agent for gases and solvents, and
for removing water from many compounds.
Phosphorus Halogen Compounds
Phosphorus will react directly with the halogens, forming trihalides, PX3, and pentahalides, PX5. The trihalides are
much more stable than the corresponding nitrogen trihalides; nitrogen pentahalides do not form because of nitrogen’s
inability to form more than four bonds.
The chlorides PCl3 and PCl5, both shown in Figure 18.41, are the most important halides of phosphorus. Phosphorus
trichloride is a colorless liquid that is prepared by passing chlorine over molten phosphorus. Phosphorus pentachloride
is an off-white solid that is prepared by oxidizing the trichloride with excess chlorine. The pentachloride sublimes
when warmed and forms an equilibrium with the trichloride and chlorine when heated.
Figure 18.41 This image shows the molecular structure of PCl3 (left) and PCl5 (right) in the gas phase.
Like most other nonmetal halides, both phosphorus chlorides react with an excess of water and yield hydrogen
chloride and an oxyacid: PCl3 yields phosphorous acid H3PO3 and PCl5 yields phosphoric acid, H3PO4.
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 987
The pentahalides of phosphorus are Lewis acids because of the empty valence d orbitals of phosphorus. These
compounds readily react with halide ions (Lewis bases) to give the anion PX6 −. Whereas phosphorus pentafluoride
is a molecular compound in all states, X-ray studies show that solid phosphorus pentachloride is an ionic compound,
[PCl4 +][PCl6 −], as are phosphorus pentabromide, [PBr4 +] [Br−], and phosphorus pentaiodide, [PI4 +] [I−].
18.9 Occurrence, Preparation, and Compounds of Oxygen
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the properties, preparation, and compounds of oxygen
• Describe the preparation, properties, and uses of some representative metal oxides, peroxides, and
hydroxides
Oxygen is the most abundant element on the earth’s crust. The earth’s surface is composed of the crust, atmosphere,
and hydrosphere. About 50% of the mass of the earth’s crust consists of oxygen (combined with other elements,
principally silicon). Oxygen occurs as O2 molecules and, to a limited extent, as O3 (ozone) molecules in air. It forms
about 20% of the mass of the air. About 89% of water by mass consists of combined oxygen. In combination with
carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, oxygen is a large part of plants and animals.
Oxygen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas at ordinary temperatures. It is slightly denser than air. Although it is
only slightly soluble in water (49 mL of gas dissolves in 1 L at STP), oxygen’s solubility is very important to aquatic
life.
Most of the oxygen isolated commercially comes from air and the remainder from the electrolysis of water. The
separation of oxygen from air begins with cooling and compressing the air until it liquefies. As liquid air warms,
oxygen with its higher boiling point (90 K) separates from nitrogen, which has a lower boiling point (77 K). It is
possible to separate the other components of air at the same time based on differences in their boiling points.
Oxygen is essential in combustion processes such as the burning of fuels. Plants and animals use the oxygen from
the air in respiration. The administration of oxygen-enriched air is an important medical practice when a patient is
receiving an inadequate supply of oxygen because of shock, pneumonia, or some other illness.
The chemical industry employs oxygen for oxidizing many substances. A significant amount of oxygen produced
commercially is important in the removal of carbon from iron during steel production. Large quantities of pure oxygen
are also necessary in metal fabrication and in the cutting and welding of metals with oxyhydrogen and oxyacetylene
torches.
Liquid oxygen is important to the space industry. It is an oxidizing agent in rocket engines. It is also the source of
gaseous oxygen for life support in space.
As we know, oxygen is very important to life. The energy required for the maintenance of normal body functions in
human beings and in other organisms comes from the slow oxidation of chemical compounds. Oxygen is the final
oxidizing agent in these reactions. In humans, oxygen passes from the lungs into the blood, where it combines with
hemoglobin, producing oxyhemoglobin. In this form, blood transports the oxygen to tissues, where it is transferred
to the tissues. The ultimate products are carbon dioxide and water. The blood carries the carbon dioxide through the
veins to the lungs, where the blood releases the carbon dioxide and collects another supply of oxygen. Digestion and
assimilation of food regenerate the materials consumed by oxidation in the body; the energy liberated is the same as
if the food burned outside the body.
Green plants continually replenish the oxygen in the atmosphere by a process called photosynthesis. The products
of photosynthesis may vary, but, in general, the process converts carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a sugar) and
oxygen using the energy of light:
988 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals

6CO2(g) + 6H2 O(l) →⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯
light
chlorophyll C6 H12 O6(aq) + 6O2(g)
carbon water glucose oxygen
dioxide
Thus, the oxygen that became carbon dioxide and water by the metabolic processes in plants and animals returns to
the atmosphere by photosynthesis.
When dry oxygen is passed between two electrically charged plates, ozone (O3, illustrated in Figure 18.42), an
allotrope of oxygen possessing a distinctive odor, forms. The formation of ozone from oxygen is an endothermic
reaction, in which the energy comes from an electrical discharge, heat, or ultraviolet light:
3O2(g) →⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯
electric discharge 2O3(g) ΔH° = 287 kJ
The sharp odor associated with sparking electrical equipment is due, in part, to ozone.
Figure 18.42 The image shows the bent ozone (O3) molecule and the resonance structures necessary to describe
its bonding.
Ozone forms naturally in the upper atmosphere by the action of ultraviolet light from the sun on the oxygen there.
Most atmospheric ozone occurs in the stratosphere, a layer of the atmosphere extending from about 10 to 50
kilometers above the earth’s surface. This ozone acts as a barrier to harmful ultraviolet light from the sun by absorbing
it via a chemical decomposition reaction:
O3(g) →⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯
ultraviolet light O(g) + O2(g)
The reactive oxygen atoms recombine with molecular oxygen to complete the ozone cycle. The presence of
stratospheric ozone decreases the frequency of skin cancer and other damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation. It has
been clearly demonstrated that chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs (known commercially as Freons), which were present as
aerosol propellants in spray cans and as refrigerants, caused depletion of ozone in the stratosphere. This occurred
because ultraviolet light also causes CFCs to decompose, producing atomic chlorine. The chlorine atoms react with
ozone molecules, resulting in a net removal of O3 molecules from stratosphere. This process is explored in detail in
our coverage of chemical kinetics. There is a worldwide effort to reduce the amount of CFCs used commercially, and
the ozone hole is already beginning to decrease in size as atmospheric concentrations of atomic chlorine decrease.
While ozone in the stratosphere helps protect us, ozone in the troposphere is a problem. This ozone is a toxic
component of photochemical smog.
The uses of ozone depend on its reactivity with other substances. It can be used as a bleaching agent for oils, waxes,
fabrics, and starch: It oxidizes the colored compounds in these substances to colorless compounds. It is an alternative
to chlorine as a disinfectant for water.
Reactions
Elemental oxygen is a strong oxidizing agent. It reacts with most other elements and many compounds.
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 989
Reaction with Elements
Oxygen reacts directly at room temperature or at elevated temperatures with all other elements except the noble gases,
the halogens, and few second- and third-row transition metals of low reactivity (those with higher reduction potentials
than copper). Rust is an example of the reaction of oxygen with iron. The more active metals form peroxides or
superoxides. Less active metals and the nonmetals give oxides. Two examples of these reactions are:
2Mg(s) + O2(g) ⟶ 2MgO(s)
P4(s) + 5O2(g) ⟶ P4 O10(s)
The oxides of halogens, at least one of the noble gases, and metals with higher reduction potentials than copper do
not form by the direct action of the elements with oxygen.
Reaction with Compounds
Elemental oxygen also reacts with some compounds. If it is possible to oxidize any of the elements in a given
compound, further oxidation by oxygen can occur. For example, hydrogen sulfide, H2S, contains sulfur with an
oxidation state of 2−. Because the sulfur does not exhibit its maximum oxidation state, we would expect H2S to react
with oxygen. It does, yielding water and sulfur dioxide. The reaction is:
2H2 S(g) + 3O2(g) ⟶ 2H2 O(l) + 2SO2(g)
It is also possible to oxidize oxides such as CO and P4O6 that contain an element with a lower oxidation state. The
ease with which elemental oxygen picks up electrons is mirrored by the difficulty of removing electrons from oxygen
in most oxides. Of the elements, only the very reactive fluorine can oxidize oxides to form oxygen gas.
Oxides, Peroxides, and Hydroxides
Compounds of the representative metals with oxygen fall into three categories: (1) oxides, containing oxide ions,
O2−; (2) peroxides, containing peroxides ions, O2 2−, with oxygen-oxygen covalent single bonds and a very limited
number of superoxides, containing superoxide ions, O2 −, with oxygen-oxygen covalent bonds that have a bond
order of 1 1
2, In addition, there are (3) hydroxides, containing hydroxide ions, OH−. All representative metals form
oxides. Some of the metals of group 2 also form peroxides, MO2, and the metals of group 1 also form peroxides,
M2O2, and superoxides, MO2.
Oxides
It is possible to produce the oxides of most representative metals by heating the corresponding hydroxides (forming
the oxide and gaseous water) or carbonates (forming the oxide and gaseous CO2). Equations for example reactions
are:
2Al(OH)3(s) →⎯⎯
Δ Al2 O3(s) + 3H2 O(g)
CaCO3(s) →⎯⎯
Δ CaO(s) + CO2(g)
However, alkali metal salts generally are very stable and do not decompose easily when heated. Alkali metal oxides
result from the oxidation-reduction reactions created by heating nitrates or hydroxides with the metals. Equations for
sample reactions are:
2KNO3(s) + 10K(s) →⎯⎯
Δ 6K2 O(s) + N2(g)
2LiOH(s) + 2Li(s) →⎯⎯
Δ 2Li2 O(s) + H2(g)
With the exception of mercury(II) oxide, it is possible to produce the oxides of the metals of groups 2–15 by burning
the corresponding metal in air. The heaviest member of each group, the member for which the inert pair effect is
most pronounced, forms an oxide in which the oxidation state of the metal ion is two less than the group oxidation
state (inert pair effect). Thus, Tl2O, PbO, and Bi2O3 form when burning thallium, lead, and bismuth, respectively.
990 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
The oxides of the lighter members of each group exhibit the group oxidation state. For example, SnO2 forms from
burning tin. Mercury(II) oxide, HgO, forms slowly when mercury is warmed below 500 °C; it decomposes at higher
temperatures.
Burning the members of groups 1 and 2 in air is not a suitable way to form the oxides of these elements. These metals
are reactive enough to combine with nitrogen in the air, so they form mixtures of oxides and ionic nitrides. Several
also form peroxides or superoxides when heated in air.
Ionic oxides all contain the oxide ion, a very powerful hydrogen ion acceptor. With the exception of the very insoluble
aluminum oxide, Al2O3, tin(IV), SnO2, and lead(IV), PbO2, the oxides of the representative metals react with acids
to form salts. Some equations for these reactions are:
Na2 O + 2HNO3(aq) ⟶ 2NaNO3(aq) + H2 O(l)
CaO(s) + 2HCL(aq) ⟶ CaCl2(aq) + H2 O(l)
SnO(s) + 2HClO4(aq) ⟶ Sn(ClO4)2(aq) + H2 O(l)
The oxides of the metals of groups 1 and 2 and of thallium(I) oxide react with water and form hydroxides. Examples
of such reactions are:
Na2 O(s) + H2 O(l) ⟶ NaOH(aq)
CaO(s) + H2 O(l) ⟶ Ca(OH)2(aq)
Tl2 O(s) + H2 O(aq) ⟶ 2TlOH(aq)
The oxides of the alkali metals have little industrial utility, unlike magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, and aluminum
oxide. Magnesium oxide is important in making firebrick, crucibles, furnace linings, and thermal
insulation—applications that require chemical and thermal stability. Calcium oxide, sometimes called quicklime or
lime in the industrial market, is very reactive, and its principal uses reflect its reactivity. Pure calcium oxide emits
an intense white light when heated to a high temperature (as illustrated in Figure 18.43). Blocks of calcium oxide
heated by gas flames were the stage lights in theaters before electricity was available. This is the source of the phrase
“in the limelight.”
Figure 18.43 Calcium oxide has many industrial uses. When it is heated at high temperatures, it emits an intense
white light.
Calcium oxide and calcium hydroxide are inexpensive bases used extensively in chemical processing, although most
of the useful products prepared from them do not contain calcium. Calcium oxide, CaO, is made by heating calcium
carbonate, CaCO3, which is widely and inexpensively available as limestone or oyster shells:
CaCO3(s) ⟶ CaO(s) + CO2(g)
Although this decomposition reaction is reversible, it is possible to obtain a 100% yield of CaO by allowing the CO2
to escape. It is possible to prepare calcium hydroxide by the familiar acid-base reaction of a soluble metal oxide with
water:
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 991
CaO(s) + H2 O(l) ⟶ Ca(OH)2(s)
Both CaO and Ca(OH)2 are useful as bases; they accept protons and neutralize acids.
Alumina (Al2O3) occurs in nature as the mineral corundum, a very hard substance used as an abrasive for grinding and
polishing. Corundum is important to the jewelry trade as ruby and sapphire. The color of ruby is due to the presence
of a small amount of chromium; other impurities produce the wide variety of colors possible for sapphires. Artificial
rubies and sapphires are now manufactured by melting aluminum oxide (melting point = 2050 °C) with small amounts
of oxides to produce the desired colors and cooling the melt in such a way as to produce large crystals. Ruby lasers
use synthetic ruby crystals.
Zinc oxide, ZnO, was a useful white paint pigment; however, pollutants tend to discolor the compound. The
compound is also important in the manufacture of automobile tires and other rubber goods, and in the preparation of
medicinal ointments. For example, zinc-oxide-based sunscreens, as shown in Figure 18.44, help prevent sunburn.
The zinc oxide in these sunscreens is present in the form of very small grains known as nanoparticles. Lead dioxide
is a constituent of charged lead storage batteries. Lead(IV) tends to revert to the more stable lead(II) ion by gaining
two electrons, so lead dioxide is a powerful oxidizing agent.
Figure 18.44 Zinc oxide protects exposed skin from sunburn. (credit: modification of work by "osseous"/Flickr)
Peroxides and Superoxides
Peroxides and superoxides are strong oxidizers and are important in chemical processes. Hydrogen peroxide, H2O2,
prepared from metal peroxides, is an important bleach and disinfectant. Peroxides and superoxides form when the
metal or metal oxides of groups 1 and 2 react with pure oxygen at elevated temperatures. Sodium peroxide and the
peroxides of calcium, strontium, and barium form by heating the corresponding metal or metal oxide in pure oxygen:
2Na(s) + O2(g) →⎯⎯
Δ Na2 O2(s)
2Na2 O(s) + O2(g) →⎯⎯
Δ 2Na2 O2(s)
2SrO(s) + O2(g) →⎯⎯
Δ 2SrO2(s)
The peroxides of potassium, rubidium, and cesium can be prepared by heating the metal or its oxide in a carefully
controlled amount of oxygen:
2K(s) + O2(g) ⟶ K2 O2(s) (2 mol K per mol O2)
With an excess of oxygen, the superoxides KO2, RbO2, and CsO2 form. For example:
K(s) + O2(g) ⟶ KO2(s) (1 mol K per mol O2)
The stability of the peroxides and superoxides of the alkali metals increases as the size of the cation increases.
Hydroxides
Hydroxides are compounds that contain the OH− ion. It is possible to prepare these compounds by two general types
of reactions. Soluble metal hydroxides can be produced by the reaction of the metal or metal oxide with water.
992 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Insoluble metal hydroxides form when a solution of a soluble salt of the metal combines with a solution containing
hydroxide ions.
With the exception of beryllium and magnesium, the metals of groups 1 and 2 react with water to form hydroxides
and hydrogen gas. Examples of such reactions include:
2Li(s) + 2H2 O(l) ⟶ 2LiOH(aq) + H2(g)
Ca(s) + 2H2 O(l) ⟶ Ca(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)
However, these reactions can be violent and dangerous; therefore, it is preferable to produce soluble metal hydroxides
by the reaction of the respective oxide with water:
Li2 O(s) + H2 O(l) ⟶ 2LiOH(aq)
CaO(s) + H2 O(l) ⟶ Ca(OH)2(aq)
Most metal oxides are base anhydrides. This is obvious for the soluble oxides because they form metal hydroxides.
Most other metal oxides are insoluble and do not form hydroxides in water; however, they are still base anhydrides
because they will react with acids.
It is possible to prepare the insoluble hydroxides of beryllium, magnesium, and other representative metals by the
addition of sodium hydroxide to a solution of a salt of the respective metal. The net ionic equations for the reactions
involving a magnesium salt, an aluminum salt, and a zinc salt are:
Mg2+(aq) + 2OH−(aq) ⟶ Mg(OH)2(s)
Al3+(aq) + 3OH−(aq) ⟶ Al(OH)3(s)
Zn2+(aq) + 2OH−(aq) ⟶ Zn(OH)2(s)
An excess of hydroxide must be avoided when preparing aluminum, gallium, zinc, and tin(II) hydroxides, or
the hydroxides will dissolve with the formation of the corresponding complex ions: Al(OH)4 −, Ga(OH)4 −,
Zn(OH)4 2−, and Sn(OH)3 − (see Figure 18.45). The important aspect of complex ions for this chapter is that
they form by a Lewis acid-base reaction with the metal being the Lewis acid.
Figure 18.45 (a) Mixing solutions of NaOH and Zn(NO3)2 produces a white precipitate of Zn(OH)2. (b) Addition of an
excess of NaOH results in dissolution of the precipitate. (credit: modification of work by Mark Ott)
Industry uses large quantities of sodium hydroxide as a cheap, strong base. Sodium chloride is the starting material
for the production of NaOH because NaCl is a less expensive starting material than the oxide. Sodium hydroxide is
among the top 10 chemicals in production in the United States, and this production was almost entirely by electrolysis
of solutions of sodium chloride. This process is the chlor-alkali process, and it is the primary method for producing
chlorine.
Sodium hydroxide is an ionic compound and melts without decomposition. It is very soluble in water, giving off a
great deal of heat and forming very basic solutions: 40 grams of sodium hydroxide dissolves in only 60 grams of
water at 25 °C. Sodium hydroxide is employed in the production of other sodium compounds and is used to neutralize
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 993
acidic solutions during the production of other chemicals such as petrochemicals and polymers.
Many of the applications of hydroxides are for the neutralization of acids (such as the antacid shown in Figure
18.46) and for the preparation of oxides by thermal decomposition. An aqueous suspension of magnesium hydroxide
constitutes the antacid milk of magnesia. Because of its ready availability (from the reaction of water with calcium
oxide prepared by the decomposition of limestone, CaCO3), low cost, and activity, calcium hydroxide is used
extensively in commercial applications needing a cheap, strong base. The reaction of hydroxides with appropriate
acids is also used to prepare salts.

in your stomach. (credit: “Midnightcomm”/Wikimedia Commons)
The Chlor-Alkali Process
Although they are very different chemically, there is a link between chlorine and sodium hydroxide because
there is an important electrochemical process that produces the two chemicals simultaneously. The process
known as the chlor-alkali process, utilizes sodium chloride, which occurs in large deposits in many parts of the
world. This is an electrochemical process to oxidize chloride ion to chlorine and generate sodium hydroxide.
Passing a direct current of electricity through a solution of NaCl causes the chloride ions to migrate to the
positive electrode where oxidation to gaseous chlorine occurs when the ion gives up an electron to the
electrode:
2Cl−(aq) ⟶ Cl2(g) + 2e− (at the positive electrode)
The electrons produced travel through the outside electrical circuit to the negative electrode. Although the
positive sodium ions migrate toward this negative electrode, metallic sodium does not form because sodium
ions are too difficult to reduce under the conditions used. (Recall that metallic sodium is active enough to react
with water and hence, even if produced, would immediately react with water to produce sodium ions again.)
Instead, water molecules pick up electrons from the electrode and undergo reduction to form hydrogen gas
and hydroxide ions:

2H2 O(l) + 2e− (from the negative electrode) ⟶ H2(g) + 2OH−(aq)
The overall result is the conversion of the aqueous solution of NaCl to an aqueous solution of NaOH, gaseous
Cl2, and gaseous H2:
2Na+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq) + 2H2 O(l) →⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯
electrolysis 2Na+(aq) + 2OH−(aq) + Cl2(g) + H2(g)
Nonmetal Oxygen Compounds
Most nonmetals react with oxygen to form nonmetal oxides. Depending on the available oxidation states for the
element, a variety of oxides might form. Fluorine will combine with oxygen to form fluorides such as OF2, where the
oxygen has a 2+-oxidation state.
Sulfur Oxygen Compounds
The two common oxides of sulfur are sulfur dioxide, SO2, and sulfur trioxide, SO3. The odor of burning sulfur comes
from sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide, shown in Figure 18.47, occurs in volcanic gases and in the atmosphere near
industrial plants that burn fuel containing sulfur compounds.
Figure 18.47 This image shows the molecular structure (left) and resonance forms (right) of sulfur dioxide.
Commercial production of sulfur dioxide is from either burning sulfur or roasting sulfide ores such as ZnS, FeS2, and
Cu2S in air. (Roasting, which forms the metal oxide, is the first step in the separation of many metals from their ores.)
A convenient method for preparing sulfur dioxide in the laboratory is by the action of a strong acid on either sulfite
salts containing the SO3 2− ion or hydrogen sulfite salts containing HSO3 −. Sulfurous acid, H2SO3, forms first, but
quickly decomposes into sulfur dioxide and water. Sulfur dioxide also forms when many reducing agents react with
hot, concentrated sulfuric acid. Sulfur trioxide forms slowly when heating sulfur dioxide and oxygen together, and
the reaction is exothermic:
2SO2(g) + O2(g) ⟶ 2SO3(g) ΔH° = −197.8 kJ
Sulfur dioxide is a gas at room temperature, and the SO2 molecule is bent. Sulfur trioxide melts at 17 °C and boils
at 43 °C. In the vapor state, its molecules are single SO3 units (shown in Figure 18.48), but in the solid state, SO3
exists in several polymeric forms.
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 995
Figure 18.48 This image shows the structure (top) of sulfur trioxide in the gas phase and its resonance forms
(bottom).
The sulfur oxides react as Lewis acids with many oxides and hydroxides in Lewis acid-base reactions, with the
formation of sulfites or hydrogen sulfites, and sulfates or hydrogen sulfates, respectively.
Halogen Oxygen Compounds
The halogens do not react directly with oxygen, but it is possible to prepare binary oxygen-halogen compounds by
the reactions of the halogens with oxygen-containing compounds. Oxygen compounds with chlorine, bromine, and
iodine are oxides because oxygen is the more electronegative element in these compounds. On the other hand, fluorine
compounds with oxygen are fluorides because fluorine is the more electronegative element.
As a class, the oxides are extremely reactive and unstable, and their chemistry has little practical importance.
Dichlorine oxide, formally called dichlorine monoxide, and chlorine dioxide, both shown in Figure 18.49, are the
only commercially important compounds. They are important as bleaching agents (for use with pulp and flour) and
for water treatment.
Figure 18.49 This image shows the structures of the (a) Cl2O and (b) ClO2 molecules.
Nonmetal Oxyacids and Their Salts
Nonmetal oxides form acids when allowed to react with water; these are acid anhydrides. The resulting oxyanions
can form salts with various metal ions.
Nitrogen Oxyacids and Salts
Nitrogen pentaoxide, N2O5, and NO2 react with water to form nitric acid, HNO3. Alchemists, as early as the eighth
century, knew nitric acid (shown in Figure 18.50) as aqua fortis (meaning "strong water"). The acid was useful in
the separation of gold from silver because it dissolves silver but not gold. Traces of nitric acid occur in the atmosphere
after thunderstorms, and its salts are widely distributed in nature. There are tremendous deposits of Chile saltpeter,
996 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
NaNO3, in the desert region near the boundary of Chile and Peru. Bengal saltpeter, KNO3, occurs in India and in other
countries of the Far East.
Figure 18.50 This image shows the molecular structure (left) of nitric acid, HNO3 and its resonance forms (right).
In the laboratory, it is possible to produce nitric acid by heating a nitrate salt (such as sodium or potassium nitrate)
with concentrated sulfuric acid:
NaNO3(s) + H2 SO4(l) →⎯⎯
Δ NaHSO4(s) + HNO3(g)
The Ostwald process is the commercial method for producing nitric acid. This process involves the oxidation of
ammonia to nitric oxide, NO; oxidation of nitric oxide to nitrogen dioxide, NO2; and further oxidation and hydration
of nitrogen dioxide to form nitric acid:
4NH3(g) + 5O2(g) ⟶ 4NO(g) + 6H2 O(g)
2NO(g) + O2(g) ⟶ 2NO2(g)
3NO2(g) + H2 O(l) ⟶ 2HNO3(aq) + NO(g)
Or
4NO2(g) + O2(g) + 2H2 O(g) ⟶ 4HNO3(l)
Pure nitric acid is a colorless liquid. However, it is often yellow or brown in color because NO2 forms as the acid
decomposes. Nitric acid is stable in aqueous solution; solutions containing 68% of the acid are commercially available
concentrated nitric acid. It is both a strong oxidizing agent and a strong acid.
The action of nitric acid on a metal rarely produces H2 (by reduction of H+) in more than small amounts. Instead,
the reduction of nitrogen occurs. The products formed depend on the concentration of the acid, the activity of the
metal, and the temperature. Normally, a mixture of nitrates, nitrogen oxides, and various reduction products form.
Less active metals such as copper, silver, and lead reduce concentrated nitric acid primarily to nitrogen dioxide. The
reaction of dilute nitric acid with copper produces NO. In each case, the nitrate salts of the metals crystallize upon
evaporation of the resultant solutions.
Nonmetallic elements, such as sulfur, carbon, iodine, and phosphorus, undergo oxidation by concentrated nitric acid
to their oxides or oxyacids, with the formation of NO2:
S(s) + 6HNO3(aq) ⟶ H2 SO4(aq) + 6NO2(g) + 2H2 O(l)
C(s) + 4HNO3(aq) ⟶ CO2(g) + 4NO2(g) + 2H2 O(l)
Nitric acid oxidizes many compounds; for example, concentrated nitric acid readily oxidizes hydrochloric acid to
chlorine and chlorine dioxide. A mixture of one part concentrated nitric acid and three parts concentrated hydrochloric
acid (called aqua regia, which means royal water) reacts vigorously with metals. This mixture is particularly useful
in dissolving gold, platinum, and other metals that are more difficult to oxidize than hydrogen. A simplified equation
to represent the action of aqua regia on gold is:
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 997
Au(s) + 4HCl(aq) + 3HNO3(aq) ⟶ HAuCl4(aq) + 3NO2(g) + 3H2 O(l)
Although gold is generally unreactive, you can watch a video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16gold) of
the complex mixture of compounds present in aqua regia dissolving it into solution.
Nitrates, salts of nitric acid, form when metals, oxides, hydroxides, or carbonates react with nitric acid. Most nitrates
are soluble in water; indeed, one of the significant uses of nitric acid is to prepare soluble metal nitrates.
Nitric acid finds extensive use in the laboratory and in chemical industries as a strong acid and strong oxidizing agent.
It is important in the manufacture of explosives, dyes, plastics, and drugs. Salts of nitric acid (nitrates) are valuable as
fertilizers. Gunpowder is a mixture of potassium nitrate, sulfur, and charcoal.
The reaction of N2O3 with water gives a pale blue solution of nitrous acid, HNO2. However, HNO2 (shown in Figure
18.51) is easier to prepare by the addition of an acid to a solution of nitrite; nitrous acid is a weak acid, so the nitrite
ion is basic in aqueous solution:
NO2 −(aq) + H3 O+(aq) ⟶ HNO2(aq) + H2 O(l)
Nitrous acid is very unstable and exists only in solution. It disproportionates slowly at room temperature (rapidly
when heated) into nitric acid and nitric oxide. Nitrous acid is an active oxidizing agent with strong reducing agents,
and strong oxidizing agents oxidize it to nitric acid.
Figure 18.51 This image shows the molecular structure of a molecule of nitrous acid, HNO2.
Sodium nitrite, NaNO2, is an additive to meats such as hot dogs and cold cuts. The nitrite ion has two functions.
It limits the growth of bacteria that can cause food poisoning, and it prolongs the meat’s retention of its red color.
The addition of sodium nitrite to meat products is controversial because nitrous acid reacts with certain organic
compounds to form a class of compounds known as nitrosamines. Nitrosamines produce cancer in laboratory animals.
This has prompted the FDA to limit the amount of NaNO2 in foods.
The nitrites are much more stable than the acid, but nitrites, like nitrates, can explode. Nitrites, like nitrates, are also
soluble in water (AgNO2 is only slightly soluble).
Phosphorus Oxyacids and Salts
Pure orthophosphoric acid, H3PO4 (shown in Figure 18.52), forms colorless, deliquescent crystals that melt at 42
°C. The common name of this compound is phosphoric acid, and is commercially available as a viscous 82% solution
known as syrupy phosphoric acid. One use of phosphoric acid is as an additive to many soft drinks.
One commercial method of preparing orthophosphoric acid is to treat calcium phosphate rock with concentrated
sulfuric acid:
Link to Learning

Ca3 (PO4)2(s) + 3H2 SO4(aq) ⟶ 2H3 PO4(aq) + 3CaSO4(s)
Figure 18.52 Orthophosphoric acid, H3PO4, is colorless when pure and has this molecular (left) and Lewis structure
(right).
Dilution of the products with water, followed by filtration to remove calcium sulfate, gives a dilute acid solution
contaminated with calcium dihydrogen phosphate, Ca(H2PO4)2, and other compounds associated with calcium
phosphate rock. It is possible to prepare pure orthophosphoric acid by dissolving P4O10 in water.
The action of water on P4O6, PCl3, PBr3, or PI3 forms phosphorous acid, H3PO3 (shown in Figure 18.53). The best
method for preparing pure phosphorous acid is by hydrolyzing phosphorus trichloride:
PCl3(l) + 3H2 O(l) ⟶ H3 PO3(aq) + 3HCl(g)
Heating the resulting solution expels the hydrogen chloride and leads to the evaporation of water. When sufficient
water evaporates, white crystals of phosphorous acid will appear upon cooling. The crystals are deliquescent, very
soluble in water, and have an odor like that of garlic. The solid melts at 70.1 °C and decomposes at about 200 °C by
disproportionation into phosphine and orthophosphoric acid:
4H3 PO3(l) ⟶ PH3(g) + 3H3 PO4(l)
Figure 18.53 In a molecule of phosphorous acid, H3PO3, only the two hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen atom
are acidic.
Phosphorous acid forms only two series of salts, which contain the dihydrogen phosphite ion, H2 PO3 −, or the
hydrogen phosphate ion, HPO3 2−, respectively. It is not possible to replace the third atom of hydrogen because it
is not very acidic, as it is not easy to ionize the P-H bond.
Sulfur Oxyacids and Salts
The preparation of sulfuric acid, H2SO4 (shown in Figure 18.54), begins with the oxidation of sulfur to sulfur
trioxide and then converting the trioxide to sulfuric acid. Pure sulfuric acid is a colorless, oily liquid that freezes at
10.5 °C. It fumes when heated because the acid decomposes to water and sulfur trioxide. The heating process causes
the loss of more sulfur trioxide than water, until reaching a concentration of 98.33% acid. Acid of this concentration
boils at 338 °C without further change in concentration (a constant boiling solution) and is commercially concentrated
H2SO4. The amount of sulfuric acid used in industry exceeds that of any other manufactured compound.
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 999
Figure 18.54 Sulfuric acid has a tetrahedral molecular structure.
The strong affinity of concentrated sulfuric acid for water makes it a good dehydrating agent. It is possible to dry
gases and immiscible liquids that do not react with the acid by passing them through the acid.
Sulfuric acid is a strong diprotic acid that ionizes in two stages. In aqueous solution, the first stage is essentially
complete. The secondary ionization is not nearly so complete, and HSO4 − is a moderately strong acid (about 25%
ionized in solution of a HSO4 − salt: Ka = 1.2 × 10−2).
Being a diprotic acid, sulfuric acid forms both sulfates, such as Na2SO4, and hydrogen sulfates, such as NaHSO4.
Most sulfates are soluble in water; however, the sulfates of barium, strontium, calcium, and lead are only slightly
soluble in water.
Among the important sulfates are Na2SO4⋅10H2O and Epsom salts, MgSO4⋅7H2O. Because the HSO4 − ion is an
acid, hydrogen sulfates, such as NaHSO4, exhibit acidic behavior, and this compound is the primary ingredient in
some household cleansers.
Hot, concentrated sulfuric acid is an oxidizing agent. Depending on its concentration, the temperature, and the
strength of the reducing agent, sulfuric acid oxidizes many compounds and, in the process, undergoes reduction to
SO2, HSO3 −, SO3 2−, S, H2S, or S2−.
Sulfur dioxide dissolves in water to form a solution of sulfurous acid, as expected for the oxide of a nonmetal.
Sulfurous acid is unstable, and it is not possible to isolate anhydrous H2SO3. Heating a solution of sulfurous acid
expels the sulfur dioxide. Like other diprotic acids, sulfurous acid ionizes in two steps: The hydrogen sulfite ion,
HSO3 −, and the sulfite ion, SO3 2−, form. Sulfurous acid is a moderately strong acid. Ionization is about 25% in
the first stage, but it is much less in the second (Ka1 = 1.2 × 10−2 and Ka2 = 6.2 × 10−8).
In order to prepare solid sulfite and hydrogen sulfite salts, it is necessary to add a stoichiometric amount of a base to a
sulfurous acid solution and then evaporate the water. These salts also form from the reaction of SO2 with oxides and
hydroxides. Heating solid sodium hydrogen sulfite forms sodium sulfite, sulfur dioxide, and water:
2NaHSO3(s) →⎯⎯
Δ Na2 SO3(s) + SO2(g) + H2 O(l)
Strong oxidizing agents can oxidize sulfurous acid. Oxygen in the air oxidizes it slowly to the more stable sulfuric
acid:
2H2 SO3(aq) + O2(g) + 2H2 O(l) →⎯⎯
Δ 2H3 O+(aq) + 2HSO4 −(aq)
Solutions of sulfites are also very susceptible to air oxidation to produce sulfates. Thus, solutions of sulfites always
contain sulfates after exposure to air.

Halogen Oxyacids and Their Salts
The compounds HXO, HXO2, HXO3, and HXO4, where X represents Cl, Br, or I, are the hypohalous, halous, halic,
and perhalic acids, respectively. The strengths of these acids increase from the hypohalous acids, which are very weak
acids, to the perhalic acids, which are very strong. Table 18.2 lists the known acids, and, where known, their pKa
values are given in parentheses.
Oxyacids of the Halogens
Name Fluorine Chlorine Bromine Iodine
hypohalous HOF HOCl (7.5) HOBr (8.7) HOI (11)
halous HClO2 (2.0)
halic HClO3 HBrO3 HIO3 (0.8)
perhalic HClO4 HBrO4 HIO4 (1.6)
paraperhalic H5IO6 (1.6)
Table 18.2
The only known oxyacid of fluorine is the very unstable hypofluorous acid, HOF, which is prepared by the reaction
of gaseous fluorine with ice:
F2(g) + H2 O(s) ⟶ HOF(g) + HF(g)
The compound is very unstable and decomposes above −40 °C. This compound does not ionize in water, and there are
no known salts. It is uncertain whether the name hypofluorous acid is even appropriate for HOF; a more appropriate
name might be hydrogen hypofluorite.
The reactions of chlorine and bromine with water are analogous to that of fluorine with ice, but these reactions do not
go to completion, and mixtures of the halogen and the respective hypohalous and hydrohalic acids result. Other than
HOF, the hypohalous acids only exist in solution. The hypohalous acids are all very weak acids; however, HOCl is a
stronger acid than HOBr, which, in turn, is stronger than HOI.
The addition of base to solutions of the hypohalous acids produces solutions of salts containing the basic hypohalite
ions, OX−. It is possible to isolate these salts as solids. All of the hypohalites are unstable with respect to
disproportionation in solution, but the reaction is slow for hypochlorite. Hypobromite and hypoiodite disproportionate
rapidly, even in the cold:
3XO −(aq) ⟶ 2X−(aq) + XO 3 −(aq)
Sodium hypochlorite is an inexpensive bleach (Clorox) and germicide. The commercial preparation involves the
electrolysis of cold, dilute, aqueous sodium chloride solutions under conditions where the resulting chlorine and
hydroxide ion can react. The net reaction is:
Cl−(aq) + H2 O(l) →⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯
electrical energy ClO−(aq) + H2(g)
The only definitely known halous acid is chlorous acid, HClO2, obtained by the reaction of barium chlorite with dilute
sulfuric acid:
Ba(ClO2)2(aq) + H2 SO4(aq) ⟶ BaSO4(s) + 2HClO2(aq)
Filtering the insoluble barium sulfate leaves a solution of HClO2. Chlorous acid is not stable; it slowly decomposes
in solution to yield chlorine dioxide, hydrochloric acid, and water. Chlorous acid reacts with bases to give salts
containing the chlorite ion (shown in Figure 18.55). Sodium chlorite finds an extensive application in the bleaching
of paper because it is a strong oxidizing agent and does not damage the paper.
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1001
Figure 18.55 Chlorite ions, ClO2 −, are produced when chlorous acid reacts with bases.
Chloric acid, HClO3, and bromic acid, HBrO3, are stable only in solution. The reaction of iodine with concentrated
nitric acid produces stable white iodic acid, HIO3:
I2(s) + 10HNO3(aq) ⟶ 2HIO3(s) + 10NO2(g) + 4H2 O(l)
It is possible to obtain the lighter halic acids from their barium salts by reaction with dilute sulfuric acid. The
reaction is analogous to that used to prepare chlorous acid. All of the halic acids are strong acids and very active
oxidizing agents. The acids react with bases to form salts containing chlorate ions (shown in Figure 18.56). Another
preparative method is the electrochemical oxidation of a hot solution of a metal halide to form the appropriate metal
chlorates. Sodium chlorate is a weed killer; potassium chlorate is used as an oxidizing agent.
Figure 18.56 Chlorate ions, ClO3 −, are produced when halic acids react with bases.
Perchloric acid, HClO4, forms when treating a perchlorate, such as potassium perchlorate, with sulfuric acid under
reduced pressure. The HClO4 can be distilled from the mixture:
KClO4(s) + H2 SO4(aq) ⟶ HClO4(g) + KHSO4(s)
Dilute aqueous solutions of perchloric acid are quite stable thermally, but concentrations above 60% are unstable
and dangerous. Perchloric acid and its salts are powerful oxidizing agents, as the very electronegative chlorine is
more stable in a lower oxidation state than 7+. Serious explosions have occurred when heating concentrated solutions
with easily oxidized substances. However, its reactions as an oxidizing agent are slow when perchloric acid is cold
and dilute. The acid is among the strongest of all acids. Most salts containing the perchlorate ion (shown in Figure
18.57) are soluble. It is possible to prepare them from reactions of bases with perchloric acid and, commercially, by
the electrolysis of hot solutions of their chlorides.

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Figure 18.57 Perchlorate ions, ClO4 −, can be produced when perchloric acid reacts with a base or by electrolysis
of hot solutions of their chlorides.
Perbromate salts are difficult to prepare, and the best syntheses currently involve the oxidation of bromates in basic
solution with fluorine gas followed by acidification. There are few, if any, commercial uses of this acid or its salts.
There are several different acids containing iodine in the 7+-oxidation state; they include metaperiodic acid, HIO4,
and paraperiodic acid, H5IO6. These acids are strong oxidizing agents and react with bases to form the appropriate
salts.
18.10 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Sulfur
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the properties, preparation, and uses of sulfur
Sulfur exists in nature as elemental deposits as well as sulfides of iron, zinc, lead, and copper, and sulfates of sodium,
calcium, barium, and magnesium. Hydrogen sulfide is often a component of natural gas and occurs in many volcanic
gases, like those shown in Figure 18.58. Sulfur is a constituent of many proteins and is essential for life.
Figure 18.58 Volcanic gases contain hydrogen sulfide. (credit: Daniel Julie/Wikimedia Commons)
The Frasch process, illustrated in Figure 18.59, is important in the mining of free sulfur from enormous
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1003
underground deposits in Texas and Louisiana. Superheated water (170 °C and 10 atm pressure) is forced down the
outermost of three concentric pipes to the underground deposit. The hot water melts the sulfur. The innermost pipe
conducts compressed air into the liquid sulfur. The air forces the liquid sulfur, mixed with air, to flow up through the
outlet pipe. Transferring the mixture to large settling vats allows the solid sulfur to separate upon cooling. This sulfur
is 99.5% to 99.9% pure and requires no purification for most uses.
Figure 18.59 The Frasch process is used to mine sulfur from underground deposits.
Larger amounts of sulfur also come from hydrogen sulfide recovered during the purification of natural gas.
Sulfur exists in several allotropic forms. The stable form at room temperature contains eight-membered rings, and so
the true formula is S8. However, chemists commonly use S to simplify the coefficients in chemical equations; we will
follow this practice in this book.
Like oxygen, which is also a member of group 16, sulfur exhibits a distinctly nonmetallic behavior. It oxidizes metals,
1004 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
giving a variety of binary sulfides in which sulfur exhibits a negative oxidation state (2−). Elemental sulfur oxidizes
less electronegative nonmetals, and more electronegative nonmetals, such as oxygen and the halogens, will oxidize it.
Other strong oxidizing agents also oxidize sulfur. For example, concentrated nitric acid oxidizes sulfur to the sulfate
ion, with the concurrent formation of nitrogen(IV) oxide:
S(s) + 6HNO3(aq) ⟶ 2H3 O+(aq) + SO4 2−(aq) + 6NO2(g)
The chemistry of sulfur with an oxidation state of 2− is similar to that of oxygen. Unlike oxygen, however, sulfur
forms many compounds in which it exhibits positive oxidation states.
18.11 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of
Halogens
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the preparation, properties, and uses of halogens
• Describe the properties, preparation, and uses of halogen compounds
The elements in group 17 are the halogens. These are the elements fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine.
These elements are too reactive to occur freely in nature, but their compounds are widely distributed. Chlorides
are the most abundant; although fluorides, bromides, and iodides are less common, they are reasonably available.
In this section, we will examine the occurrence, preparation, and properties of halogens. Next, we will examine
halogen compounds with the representative metals followed by an examination of the interhalogens. This section will
conclude with some applications of halogens.
Occurrence and Preparation
All of the halogens occur in seawater as halide ions. The concentration of the chloride ion is 0.54 M; that of the other
halides is less than 10–4 M. Fluoride also occurs in minerals such as CaF2, Ca(PO4)3F, and Na3AlF6. Chloride also
occurs in the Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea, and in extensive salt beds that contain NaCl, KCl, or MgCl2. Part of
the chlorine in your body is present as hydrochloric acid, which is a component of stomach acid. Bromine compounds
occur in the Dead Sea and underground brines. Iodine compounds are found in small quantities in Chile saltpeter,
underground brines, and sea kelp. Iodine is essential to the function of the thyroid gland.
The best sources of halogens (except iodine) are halide salts. It is possible to oxidize the halide ions to free diatomic
halogen molecules by various methods, depending on the ease of oxidation of the halide ion. Fluoride is the most
difficult to oxidize, whereas iodide is the easiest.
The major method for preparing fluorine is electrolytic oxidation. The most common electrolysis procedure is to use
a molten mixture of potassium hydrogen fluoride, KHF2, and anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Electrolysis causes HF
to decompose, forming fluorine gas at the anode and hydrogen at the cathode. It is necessary to keep the two gases
separated to prevent their explosive recombination to reform hydrogen fluoride.
Most commercial chlorine comes from the electrolysis of the chloride ion in aqueous solutions of sodium chloride;
this is the chlor-alkali process discussed previously. Chlorine is also a product of the electrolytic production of metals
such as sodium, calcium, and magnesium from their fused chlorides. It is also possible to prepare chlorine by the
chemical oxidation of the chloride ion in acid solution with strong oxidizing agents such as manganese dioxide
(MnO2) or sodium dichromate (Na2Cr2O7). The reaction with manganese dioxide is:
MnO2(s) + 2Cl−(aq) + 4H3 O+(aq) ⟶ Mn2+(aq) + Cl2(g) + 6H2 O(l)
The commercial preparation of bromine involves the oxidation of bromide ion by chlorine:
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1005
2Br−(aq) + Cl2(g) ⟶ Br2(l) + 2Cl−(aq)
Chlorine is a stronger oxidizing agent than bromine. This method is important for the production of essentially all
domestic bromine.
Some iodine comes from the oxidation of iodine chloride, ICl, or iodic acid, HlO3. The commercial preparation of
iodine utilizes the reduction of sodium iodate, NaIO3, an impurity in deposits of Chile saltpeter, with sodium hydrogen
sulfite:
2IO3 −(aq) + 5HSO3 −(aq) ⟶ 3HSO4 −(aq) + 2SO4 2−(aq) + H2 O(l) + I2(s)
Properties of the Halogens
Fluorine is a pale yellow gas, chlorine is a greenish-yellow gas, bromine is a deep reddish-brown liquid, and iodine
is a grayish-black crystalline solid. Liquid bromine has a high vapor pressure, and the reddish vapor is readily visible
in Figure 18.60. Iodine crystals have a noticeable vapor pressure. When gently heated, these crystals sublime and
form a beautiful deep violet vapor.
Figure 18.60 Chlorine is a pale yellow-green gas (left), gaseous bromine is deep orange (center), and gaseous
iodine is purple (right). (Fluorine is so reactive that it is too dangerous to handle.) (credit: Sahar Atwa)
Bromine is only slightly soluble in water, but it is miscible in all proportions in less polar (or nonpolar) solvents such
as chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, and carbon disulfide, forming solutions that vary from yellow to reddish-brown,
depending on the concentration.
Iodine is soluble in chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, carbon disulfide, and many hydrocarbons, giving violet
solutions of I2 molecules. Iodine dissolves only slightly in water, giving brown solutions. It is quite soluble in aqueous
solutions of iodides, with which it forms brown solutions. These brown solutions result because iodine molecules
have empty valence d orbitals and can act as weak Lewis acids towards the iodide ion. The equation for the reversible
reaction of iodine (Lewis acid) with the iodide ion (Lewis base) to form triiodide ion, I3 −, is:
I2(s) + I−(aq) ⟶ I3 −(aq)
The easier it is to oxidize the halide ion, the more difficult it is for the halogen to act as an oxidizing agent. Fluorine
generally oxidizes an element to its highest oxidation state, whereas the heavier halogens may not. For example, when
excess fluorine reacts with sulfur, SF6 forms. Chlorine gives SCl2 and bromine, S2Br2. Iodine does not react with
sulfur.
Fluorine is the most powerful oxidizing agent of the known elements. It spontaneously oxidizes most other elements;
therefore, the reverse reaction, the oxidation of fluorides, is very difficult to accomplish. Fluorine reacts directly and
forms binary fluorides with all of the elements except the lighter noble gases (He, Ne, and Ar). Fluorine is such a
strong oxidizing agent that many substances ignite on contact with it. Drops of water inflame in fluorine and form
1006 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals

O2, OF2, H2O2, O3, and HF. Wood and asbestos ignite and burn in fluorine gas. Most hot metals burn vigorously in
fluorine. However, it is possible to handle fluorine in copper, iron, or nickel containers because an adherent film of
the fluoride salt passivates their surfaces. Fluorine is the only element that reacts directly with the noble gas xenon.
Although it is a strong oxidizing agent, chlorine is less active than fluorine. Mixing chlorine and hydrogen in the
dark makes the reaction between them to be imperceptibly slow. Exposure of the mixture to light causes the two to
react explosively. Chlorine is also less active towards metals than fluorine, and oxidation reactions usually require
higher temperatures. Molten sodium ignites in chlorine. Chlorine attacks most nonmetals (C, N2, and O2 are notable
exceptions), forming covalent molecular compounds. Chlorine generally reacts with compounds that contain only
carbon and hydrogen (hydrocarbons) by adding to multiple bonds or by substitution.
In cold water, chlorine undergoes a disproportionation reaction:
Cl2(aq) + 2H2 O(l) ⟶ HOCl(aq) + H3 O+(aq) + Cl−(aq)
Half the chlorine atoms oxidize to the 1+ oxidation state (hypochlorous acid), and the other half reduce to the 1−
oxidation state (chloride ion). This disproportionation is incomplete, so chlorine water is an equilibrium mixture of
chlorine molecules, hypochlorous acid molecules, hydronium ions, and chloride ions. When exposed to light, this
solution undergoes a photochemical decomposition:
2HOCl(aq) + 2H2 O(l) →⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯
sunlight 2H3 O+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq) + O2(g)
The nonmetal chlorine is more electronegative than any other element except fluorine, oxygen, and nitrogen. In
general, very electronegative elements are good oxidizing agents; therefore, we would expect elemental chlorine to
oxidize all of the other elements except for these three (and the nonreactive noble gases). Its oxidizing property,
in fact, is responsible for its principal use. For example, phosphorus(V) chloride, an important intermediate in the
preparation of insecticides and chemical weapons, is manufactured by oxidizing the phosphorus with chlorine:
P4(s) + 10Cl2(g) ⟶ 4PCl5(l)
A great deal of chlorine is also used to oxidize, and thus to destroy, organic or biological materials in water
purification and in bleaching.
The chemical properties of bromine are similar to those of chlorine, although bromine is the weaker oxidizing agent
and its reactivity is less than that of chlorine.
Iodine is the least reactive of the halogens. It is the weakest oxidizing agent, and the iodide ion is the most easily
oxidized halide ion. Iodine reacts with metals, but heating is often required. It does not oxidize other halide ions.
Compared with the other halogens, iodine reacts only slightly with water. Traces of iodine in water react with a
mixture of starch and iodide ion, forming a deep blue color. This reaction is a very sensitive test for the presence of
iodine in water.
Halides of the Representative Metals
Thousands of salts of the representative metals have been prepared. The binary halides are an important subclass of
salts. A salt is an ionic compound composed of cations and anions, other than hydroxide or oxide ions. In general,
it is possible to prepare these salts from the metals or from oxides, hydroxides, or carbonates. We will illustrate the
general types of reactions for preparing salts through reactions used to prepare binary halides.
The binary compounds of a metal with the halogens are the halides. Most binary halides are ionic. However, mercury,
the elements of group 13 with oxidation states of 3+, tin(IV), and lead(IV) form covalent binary halides.
The direct reaction of a metal and a halogen produce the halide of the metal. Examples of these oxidation-reduction
reactions include:
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1007
Cd(s) + Cl2(g) ⟶ CdCl2(s)
2Ga(l) + 3Br2(l) ⟶ 2GaBr3(s)
Reactions of the alkali metals with elemental halogens are very exothermic and often quite violent. Under
controlled conditions, they provide exciting demonstrations for budding students of chemistry. You can
view the initial heating (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16sodium) of the sodium that removes the
coating of sodium hydroxide, sodium peroxide, and residual mineral oil to expose the reactive surface.
The reaction with chlorine gas then proceeds very nicely.
If a metal can exhibit two oxidation states, it may be necessary to control the stoichiometry in order to obtain the
halide with the lower oxidation state. For example, preparation of tin(II) chloride requires a 1:1 ratio of Sn to Cl2,
whereas preparation of tin(IV) chloride requires a 1:2 ratio:
Sn(s) + Cl2(g) ⟶ SnCl2(s)
Sn(s) + 2Cl2(g) ⟶ SnCl4(l)
The active representative metals—those that are easier to oxidize than hydrogen—react with gaseous hydrogen
halides to produce metal halides and hydrogen. The reaction of zinc with hydrogen fluoride is:
Zn(s) + 2HF(g) ⟶ ZnF2(s) + H2(g)
The active representative metals also react with solutions of hydrogen halides to form hydrogen and solutions of the
corresponding halides. Examples of such reactions include:
Cd(s) + 2HBr(aq) ⟶ CdBr2(aq) + H2(g)
Sn(s) + 2HI(aq) ⟶ SnI2(aq) + H2(g)
Hydroxides, carbonates, and some oxides react with solutions of the hydrogen halides to form solutions of halide
salts. It is possible to prepare additional salts by the reaction of these hydroxides, carbonates, and oxides with aqueous
solution of other acids:
CaCo3(s) + 2HCl(aq) ⟶ CaCl2(aq) + CO2(g) + H2 O(l)
TlOH(aq) + HF(aq) ⟶ TlF(aq) + H2 O(l)
A few halides and many of the other salts of the representative metals are insoluble. It is possible to prepare these
soluble salts by metathesis reactions that occur when solutions of soluble salts are mixed (see Figure 18.61).
Metathesis reactions are examined in the chapter on the stoichiometry of chemical reactions.

Several halides occur in large quantities in nature. The ocean and underground brines contain many halides. For
example, magnesium chloride in the ocean is the source of magnesium ions used in the production of magnesium.
Large underground deposits of sodium chloride, like the salt mine shown in Figure 18.62, occur in many parts of
the world. These deposits serve as the source of sodium and chlorine in almost all other compounds containing these
elements. The chlor-alkali process is one example.

Interhalogens
Compounds formed from two or more different halogens are interhalogens. Interhalogen molecules consist of one
atom of the heavier halogen bonded by single bonds to an odd number of atoms of the lighter halogen. The structures
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1009
of IF3, IF5, and IF7 are illustrated in Figure 18.63. Formulas for other interhalogens, each of which comes from the
reaction of the respective halogens, are in Table 18.3.
Figure 18.63 The structure of IF3 is T-shaped (left), IF5 is square pyramidal (center), and IF7 is pentagonal
bipyramidal (right).
Note from Table 18.3 that fluorine is able to oxidize iodine to its maximum oxidation state, 7+, whereas bromine
and chlorine, which are more difficult to oxidize, achieve only the 5+-oxidation state. A 7+-oxidation state is the limit
for the halogens. Because smaller halogens are grouped about a larger one, the maximum number of smaller atoms
possible increases as the radius of the larger atom increases. Many of these compounds are unstable, and most are
extremely reactive. The interhalogens react like their component halides; halogen fluorides, for example, are stronger
oxidizing agents than are halogen chlorides.
The ionic polyhalides of the alkali metals, such as KI3, KICl2, KICl4, CsIBr2, and CsBrCl2, which contain an anion
composed of at least three halogen atoms, are closely related to the interhalogens. As seen previously, the formation
of the polyhalide anion I3 − is responsible for the solubility of iodine in aqueous solutions containing an iodide ion.

–CF2CF2– units. Fluoride ion is added to water supplies and to some toothpastes as SnF2 or NaF to fight tooth decay.
Fluoride partially converts teeth from Ca5(PO4)3(OH) into Ca5(PO4)3F.

Chlorine is important to bleach wood pulp and cotton cloth. The chlorine reacts with water to form hypochlorous
acid, which oxidizes colored substances to colorless ones. Large quantities of chlorine are important in chlorinating
hydrocarbons (replacing hydrogen with chlorine) to produce compounds such as tetrachloride (CCl4), chloroform
(CHCl3), and ethyl chloride (C2H5Cl), and in the production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and other polymers.
Chlorine is also important to kill the bacteria in community water supplies.
Bromine is important in the production of certain dyes, and sodium and potassium bromides are used as sedatives. At
one time, light-sensitive silver bromide was a component of photographic film.
Iodine in alcohol solution with potassium iodide is an antiseptic (tincture of iodine). Iodide salts are essential for the
proper functioning of the thyroid gland; an iodine deficiency may lead to the development of a goiter. Iodized table
salt contains 0.023% potassium iodide. Silver iodide is useful in the seeding of clouds to induce rain; it was important
in the production of photographic film and iodoform, CHI3, is an antiseptic.
18.12 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of the
Noble Gases
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the properties, preparation, and uses of the noble gases
The elements in group 18 are the noble gases (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon). They earned the name
“noble” because they were assumed to be nonreactive since they have filled valence shells. In 1962, Dr. Neil Bartlett
at the University of British Columbia proved this assumption to be false.
These elements are present in the atmosphere in small amounts. Some natural gas contains 1–2% helium by mass.
Helium is isolated from natural gas by liquefying the condensable components, leaving only helium as a gas. The
United States possesses most of the world’s commercial supply of this element in its helium-bearing gas fields. Argon,
neon, krypton, and xenon come from the fractional distillation of liquid air. Radon comes from other radioactive
elements. More recently, it was observed that this radioactive gas is present in very small amounts in soils and
minerals. Its accumulation in well-insulated, tightly sealed buildings, however, constitutes a health hazard, primarily
lung cancer.
The boiling points and melting points of the noble gases are extremely low relative to those of other substances of
comparable atomic or molecular masses. This is because only weak London dispersion forces are present, and these
forces can hold the atoms together only when molecular motion is very slight, as it is at very low temperatures.
Helium is the only substance known that does not solidify on cooling at normal pressure. It remains liquid close to
absolute zero (0.001 K) at ordinary pressures, but it solidifies under elevated pressure.
Helium is used for filling balloons and lighter-than-air craft because it does not burn, making it safer to use than
hydrogen. Helium at high pressures is not a narcotic like nitrogen. Thus, mixtures of oxygen and helium are important
for divers working under high pressures. Using a helium-oxygen mixture avoids the disoriented mental state known
as nitrogen narcosis, the so-called rapture of the deep. Helium is important as an inert atmosphere for the melting and
welding of easily oxidizable metals and for many chemical processes that are sensitive to air.
Liquid helium (boiling point, 4.2 K) is an important coolant to reach the low temperatures necessary for cryogenic
research, and it is essential for achieving the low temperatures necessary to produce superconduction in traditional
superconducting materials used in powerful magnets and other devices. This cooling ability is necessary for the
magnets used for magnetic resonance imaging, a common medical diagnostic procedure. The other common coolant
is liquid nitrogen (boiling point, 77 K), which is significantly cheaper.
Neon is a component of neon lamps and signs. Passing an electric spark through a tube containing neon at low
pressure generates the familiar red glow of neon. It is possible to change the color of the light by mixing argon or
mercury vapor with the neon or by utilizing glass tubes of a special color.
Argon was useful in the manufacture of gas-filled electric light bulbs, where its lower heat conductivity and chemical
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1011
inertness made it preferable to nitrogen for inhibiting the vaporization of the tungsten filament and prolonging the
life of the bulb. Fluorescent tubes commonly contain a mixture of argon and mercury vapor. Argon is the third most
abundant gas in dry air.
Krypton-xenon flash tubes are used to take high-speed photographs. An electric discharge through such a tube gives
a very intense light that lasts only 1
50,000 of a second. Krypton forms a difluoride, KrF2, which is thermally unstable
at room temperature.
Stable compounds of xenon form when xenon reacts with fluorine. Xenon difluoride, XeF2, forms after heating an
excess of xenon gas with fluorine gas and then cooling. The material forms colorless crystals, which are stable at
room temperature in a dry atmosphere. Xenon tetrafluoride, XeF4, and xenon hexafluoride, XeF6, are prepared in an
analogous manner, with a stoichiometric amount of fluorine and an excess of fluorine, respectively. Compounds with
oxygen are prepared by replacing fluorine atoms in the xenon fluorides with oxygen.
When XeF6 reacts with water, a solution of XeO3 results and the xenon remains in the 6+-oxidation state:
XeF6(s) + 3H2 O(l) ⟶ XeO3(aq) + 6HF(aq)
Dry, solid xenon trioxide, XeO3, is extremely explosive—it will spontaneously detonate. Both XeF6 and XeO3
disproportionate in basic solution, producing xenon, oxygen, and salts of the perxenate ion, XeO6 4−, in which
xenon reaches its maximum oxidation sate of 8+.
Radon apparently forms RnF2—evidence of this compound comes from radiochemical tracer techniques.
Unstable compounds of argon form at low temperatures, but stable compounds of helium and neon are not known.

Summary
18.1 Periodicity
This section focuses on the periodicity of the representative elements. These are the elements where the electrons
are entering the s and p orbitals. The representative elements occur in groups 1, 2, and 12–18. These elements are
representative metals, metalloids, and nonmetals. The alkali metals (group 1) are very reactive, readily form ions with
a charge of 1+ to form ionic compounds that are usually soluble in water, and react vigorously with water to form
hydrogen gas and a basic solution of the metal hydroxide. The outermost electrons of the alkaline earth metals (group
2) are more difficult to remove than the outer electron of the alkali metals, leading to the group 2 metals being less
1014 Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
reactive than those in group 1. These elements easily form compounds in which the metals exhibit an oxidation state
of 2+. Zinc, cadmium, and mercury (group 12) commonly exhibit the group oxidation state of 2+ (although mercury
also exhibits an oxidation state of 1+ in compounds that contain Hg2 2+). Aluminum, gallium, indium, and thallium
(group 13) are easier to oxidize than is hydrogen. Aluminum, gallium, and indium occur with an oxidation state 3+
(however, thallium also commonly occurs as the Tl+ ion). Tin and lead form stable divalent cations and covalent
compounds in which the metals exhibit the 4+-oxidation state.
18.2 Occurrence and Preparation of the Representative Metals
Because of their chemical reactivity, it is necessary to produce the representative metals in their pure forms by
reduction from naturally occurring compounds. Electrolysis is important in the production of sodium, potassium,
and aluminum. Chemical reduction is the primary method for the isolation of magnesium, zinc, and tin. Similar
procedures are important for the other representative metals.
18.3 Structure and General Properties of the Metalloids
The elements boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium separate the metals from the nonmetals
in the periodic table. These elements, called metalloids or sometimes semimetals, exhibit properties characteristic of
both metals and nonmetals. The structures of these elements are similar in many ways to those of nonmetals, but the
elements are electrical semiconductors.
18.4 Structure and General Properties of the Nonmetals
Nonmetals have structures that are very different from those of the metals, primarily because they have greater
electronegativity and electrons that are more tightly bound to individual atoms. Most nonmetal oxides are acid
anhydrides, meaning that they react with water to form acidic solutions. Molecular structures are common for most
of the nonmetals, and several have multiple allotropes with varying physical properties.
18.5 Occurrence, Preparation, and Compounds of Hydrogen
Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and its chemistry is truly unique. Although it has some
chemical reactivity that is similar to that of the alkali metals, hydrogen has many of the same chemical properties of
a nonmetal with a relatively low electronegativity. It forms ionic hydrides with active metals, covalent compounds in
which it has an oxidation state of 1− with less electronegative elements, and covalent compounds in which it has an
oxidation state of 1+ with more electronegative nonmetals. It reacts explosively with oxygen, fluorine, and chlorine,
less readily with bromine, and much less readily with iodine, sulfur, and nitrogen. Hydrogen reduces the oxides of
metals with lower reduction potentials than chromium to form the metal and water. The hydrogen halides are all acidic
when dissolved in water.
18.6 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Carbonates
The usual method for the preparation of the carbonates of the alkali and alkaline earth metals is by reaction of
an oxide or hydroxide with carbon dioxide. Other carbonates form by precipitation. Metal carbonates or hydrogen
carbonates such as limestone (CaCO3), the antacid Tums (CaCO3), and baking soda (NaHCO3) are common
examples. Carbonates and hydrogen carbonates decompose in the presence of acids and most decompose on heating.
18.7 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Nitrogen
Nitrogen exhibits oxidation states ranging from 3− to 5+. Because of the stability of the N≡N triple bond, it requires a
great deal of energy to make compounds from molecular nitrogen. Active metals such as the alkali metals and alkaline
earth metals can reduce nitrogen to form metal nitrides. Nitrogen oxides and nitrogen hydrides are also important
substances.
18.8 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Phosphorus
Phosphorus (group 15) commonly exhibits oxidation states of 3− with active metals and of 3+ and 5+ with more
electronegative nonmetals. The halogens and oxygen will oxidize phosphorus. The oxides are phosphorus(V) oxide,
P4O10, and phosphorus(III) oxide, P4O6. The two common methods for preparing orthophosphoric acid, H3PO4,
Chapter 18 | Representative Metals, Metalloids, and Nonmetals 1015
are either the reaction of a phosphate with sulfuric acid or the reaction of water with phosphorus(V) oxide.
Orthophosphoric acid is a triprotic acid that forms three types of salts.
18.9 Occurrence, Preparation, and Compounds of Oxygen
Oxygen is one of the most reactive elements. This reactivity, coupled with its abundance, makes the chemistry of
oxygen very rich and well understood.
Compounds of the representative metals with oxygen exist in three categories (1) oxides, (2) peroxides and
superoxides, and (3) hydroxides. Heating the corresponding hydroxides, nitrates, or carbonates is the most common
method for producing oxides. Heating the metal or metal oxide in oxygen may lead to the formation of peroxides
and superoxides. The soluble oxides dissolve in water to form solutions of hydroxides. Most metals oxides are base
anhydrides and react with acids. The hydroxides of the representative metals react with acids in acid-base reactions
to form salts and water. The hydroxides have many commercial uses.
All nonmetals except fluorine form multiple oxides. Nearly all of the nonmetal oxides are acid anhydrides. The
acidity of oxyacids requires that the hydrogen atoms bond to the oxygen atoms in the molecule rather than to the
other nonmetal atom. Generally, the strength of the oxyacid increases with the number of oxygen atoms bonded to the
nonmetal atom and not to a hydrogen.
18.10 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Sulfur
Sulfur (group 16) reacts with almost all metals and readily forms the sulfide ion, S2−, in which it has as oxidation state
of 2−. Sulfur reacts with most nonmetals.
18.11 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Halogens
The halogens form halides with less electronegative elements. Halides of the metals vary from ionic to covalent;
halides of nonmetals are covalent. Interhalogens form by the combination of two or more different halogens.
All of the representative metals react directly with elemental halogens or with solutions of the hydrohalic acids (HF,
HCl, HBr, and HI) to produce representative metal halides. Other laboratory preparations involve the addition of
aqueous hydrohalic acids to compounds that contain such basic anions, such as hydroxides, oxides, or carbonates.
18.12 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of the Noble Gases
The most significant property of the noble gases (group 18) is their inactivity. They occur in low concentrations in
the atmosphere. They find uses as inert atmospheres, neon signs, and as coolants. The three heaviest noble gases react
with fluorine to form fluorides. The xenon fluorides are the best characterized as the starting materials for a few other
noble gas compounds.

Chapter Outline
19.1 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Transition Metals and Their Compounds
19.2 Coordination Chemistry of Transition Metals
19.3 Spectroscopic and Magnetic Properties of Coordination Compounds
Introduction
We have daily contact with many transition metals. Iron occurs everywhere—from the rings in your spiral notebook
and the cutlery in your kitchen to automobiles, ships, buildings, and in the hemoglobin in your blood. Titanium
is useful in the manufacture of lightweight, durable products such as bicycle frames, artificial hips, and jewelry.
Chromium is useful as a protective plating on plumbing fixtures and automotive detailing.
In addition to being used in their pure elemental forms, many compounds containing transition metals have numerous
other applications. Silver nitrate is used to create mirrors, zirconium silicate provides friction in automotive brakes,
and many important cancer-fighting agents, like the drug cisplatin and related species, are platinum compounds.
The variety of properties exhibited by transition metals is due to their complex valence shells. Unlike most main
group metals where one oxidation state is normally observed, the valence shell structure of transition metals means
that they usually occur in several different stable oxidation states. In addition, electron transitions in these elements
can correspond with absorption of photons in the visible electromagnetic spectrum, leading to colored compounds.
Because of these behaviors, transition metals exhibit a rich and fascinating chemistry.
19.1 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of
Transition Metals and Their Compounds
Transition metals are defined as those elements that have (or readily form) partially filled d orbitals. As shown in
Figure 19.2, the d-block elements in groups 3–11 are transition elements. The f-block elements, also called inner
transition metals (the lanthanides and actinides), also meet this criterion because the d orbital is partially occupied
before the f orbitals. The d orbitals fill with the copper family (group 11); for this reason, the next family (group
Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 1029
12) are technically not transition elements. However, the group 12 elements do display some of the same chemical
properties and are commonly included in discussions of transition metals. Some chemists do treat the group 12
elements as transition metals.
Figure 19.2 The transition metals are located in groups 3–11 of the periodic table. The inner transition metals are in
the two rows below the body of the table.
The d-block elements are divided into the first transition series (the elements Sc through Cu), the second transition
series (the elements Y through Ag), and the third transition series (the element La and the elements Hf through Au).
Actinium, Ac, is the first member of the fourth transition series, which also includes Rf through Rg.
The f-block elements are the elements Ce through Lu, which constitute the lanthanide series (or lanthanoid series),
and the elements Th through Lr, which constitute the actinide series (or actinoid series). Because lanthanum behaves
very much like the lanthanide elements, it is considered a lanthanide element, even though its electron configuration
makes it the first member of the third transition series. Similarly, the behavior of actinium means it is part of the
actinide series, although its electron configuration makes it the first member of the fourth transition series.

properties of elements. Recall that for the transition and inner transition metals, it is necessary to remove
the s electrons before the d or f electrons. Then, for each ion, give the electron configuration:
(a) cerium(III)
(b) lead(II)
(c) Ti2+
(d) Am3+
(e) Pd2+
For the examples that are transition metals, determine to which series they belong.
Solution
For ions, the s-valence electrons are lost prior to the d or f electrons.
(a) Ce3+[Xe]4f1; Ce3+ is an inner transition element in the lanthanide series.
(b) Pb2+[Xe]6s25d104f14; the electrons are lost from the p orbital. This is a main group element.
(c) titanium(II) [Ar]3d2; first transition series
(d) americium(III) [Rn]5f6; actinide
(e) palladium(II) [Kr]4d8; second transition series

Answer: V5+ is one possibility. Other examples include Sc3+, Ti4+, Cr6+, and Mn7+.
Uses of Lanthanides in Devices
Lanthanides (elements 57–71) are fairly abundant in the earth’s crust, despite their historic characterization as
rare earth elements. Thulium, the rarest naturally occurring lanthanoid, is more common in the earth’s crust
than silver (4.5 × 10−5% versus 0.79 × 10−5% by mass). There are 17 rare earth elements, consisting of
the 15 lanthanoids plus scandium and yttrium. They are called rare because they were once difficult to extract
economically, so it was rare to have a pure sample; due to similar chemical properties, it is difficult to separate
any one lanthanide from the others. However, newer separation methods, such as ion exchange resins similar
to those found in home water softeners, make the separation of these elements easier and more economical.
Most ores that contain these elements have low concentrations of all the rare earth elements mixed together.
The commercial applications of lanthanides are growing rapidly. For example, europium is important in flat
screen displays found in computer monitors, cell phones, and televisions. Neodymium is useful in laptop hard
drives and in the processes that convert crude oil into gasoline (Figure 19.3). Holmium is found in dental and
medical equipment. In addition, many alternative energy technologies rely heavily on lanthanoids. Neodymium
and dysprosium are key components of hybrid vehicle engines and the magnets used in wind turbines.

Neodymium magnets are commonly found in computer hard drives. (credit b: modification of work by “KUERT
Datenrettung”/Flickr)
As the demand for lanthanide materials has increased faster than supply, prices have also increased. In 2008,
dysprosium cost $110/kg; by 2014, the price had increased to $470/kg. Increasing the supply of lanthanoid
elements is one of the most significant challenges facing the industries that rely on the optical and magnetic
properties of these materials.
The transition elements have many properties in common with other metals. They are almost all hard, high-melting
solids that conduct heat and electricity well. They readily form alloys and lose electrons to form stable cations. In
addition, transition metals form a wide variety of stable coordination compounds, in which the central metal atom or
ion acts as a Lewis acid and accepts one or more pairs of electrons. Many different molecules and ions can donate lone
pairs to the metal center, serving as Lewis bases. In this chapter, we shall focus primarily on the chemical behavior of
the elements of the first transition series.
Properties of the Transition Elements
Transition metals demonstrate a wide range of chemical behaviors. As can be seen from their reduction potentials
(see Appendix H), some transition metals are strong reducing agents, whereas others have very low reactivity. For
example, the lanthanides all form stable 3+ aqueous cations. The driving force for such oxidations is similar to that of
alkaline earth metals such as Be or Mg, forming Be2+ and Mg2+. On the other hand, materials like platinum and gold
have much higher reduction potentials. Their ability to resist oxidation makes them useful materials for constructing
circuits and jewelry.
Ions of the lighter d-block elements, such as Cr3+, Fe3+, and Co2+, form colorful hydrated ions that are stable in
water. However, ions in the period just below these (Mo3+, Ru3+, and Ir2+) are unstable and react readily with oxygen
from the air. The majority of simple, water-stable ions formed by the heavier d-block elements are oxyanions such as
MoO4 2− and ReO4 −.
Ruthenium, osmium, rhodium, iridium, palladium, and platinum are the platinum metals. With difficulty, they form
simple cations that are stable in water, and, unlike the earlier elements in the second and third transition series, they
do not form stable oxyanions.

Both the d- and f-block elements react with nonmetals to form binary compounds; heating is often required. These
elements react with halogens to form a variety of halides ranging in oxidation state from 1+ to 6+. On heating, oxygen
reacts with all of the transition elements except palladium, platinum, silver, and gold. The oxides of these latter metals
can be formed using other reactants, but they decompose upon heating. The f-block elements, the elements of group
3, and the elements of the first transition series except copper react with aqueous solutions of acids, forming hydrogen
gas and solutions of the corresponding salts.
Transition metals can form compounds with a wide range of oxidation states. Some of the observed oxidation states
of the elements of the first transition series are shown in Figure 19.4. As we move from left to right across the
first transition series, we see that the number of common oxidation states increases at first to a maximum towards
the middle of the table, then decreases. The values in the table are typical values; there are other known values, and
it is possible to synthesize new additions. For example, in 2014, researchers were successful in synthesizing a new
oxidation state of iridium (9+).
Figure 19.4 Transition metals of the first transition series can form compounds with varying oxidation states.
For the elements scandium through manganese (the first half of the first transition series), the highest oxidation state
corresponds to the loss of all of the electrons in both the s and d orbitals of their valence shells. The titanium(IV) ion,
for example, is formed when the titanium atom loses its two 3d and two 4s electrons. These highest oxidation states
are the most stable forms of scandium, titanium, and vanadium. However, it is not possible to continue to remove all
of the valence electrons from metals as we continue through the series. Iron is known to form oxidation states from
2+ to 6+, with iron(II) and iron(III) being the most common. Most of the elements of the first transition series form
ions with a charge of 2+ or 3+ that are stable in water, although those of the early members of the series can be readily
oxidized by air.
The elements of the second and third transition series generally are more stable in higher oxidation states than are
the elements of the first series. In general, the atomic radius increases down a group, which leads to the ions of
the second and third series being larger than are those in the first series. Removing electrons from orbitals that are
located farther from the nucleus is easier than removing electrons close to the nucleus. For example, molybdenum
and tungsten, members of group 6, are limited mostly to an oxidation state of 6+ in aqueous solution. Chromium,
the lightest member of the group, forms stable Cr3+ ions in water and, in the absence of air, less stable Cr2+ ions.
The sulfide with the highest oxidation state for chromium is Cr2S3, which contains the Cr3+ ion. Molybdenum and
tungsten form sulfides in which the metals exhibit oxidation states of 4+ and 6+.
Example 19.2
Activity of the Transition Metals
Which is the strongest oxidizing agent in acidic solution: dichromate ion, which contains chromium(VI),
permanganate ion, which contains manganese(VII), or titanium dioxide, which contains titanium(IV)?
Solution
First, we need to look up the reduction half reactions (in Appendix L) for each oxide in the specified
oxidation state:
Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 1033
Cr2 O7 2− + 14H+ + 6e− ⟶ 2Cr3+ + 7H2 O +1.33 V
MnO4 − + 8H+ + 5e− ⟶ Mn2+ + H2 O +1.51 V
TiO2 + 4H+ + 2e− ⟶ Ti2+ + 2H2 O −0.50 V
A larger reduction potential means that it is easier to reduce the reactant. Permanganate, with the largest
reduction potential, is the strongest oxidizer under these conditions. Dichromate is next, followed by
titanium dioxide as the weakest oxidizing agent (the hardest to reduce) of this set.

Preparation of the Transition Elements
Ancient civilizations knew about iron, copper, silver, and gold. The time periods in human history known as the
Bronze Age and Iron Age mark the advancements in which societies learned to isolate certain metals and use them to
make tools and goods. Naturally occurring ores of copper, silver, and gold can contain high concentrations of these
metals in elemental form (Figure 19.5). Iron, on the other hand, occurs on earth almost exclusively in oxidized
forms, such as rust (Fe2O3). The earliest known iron implements were made from iron meteorites. Surviving iron
artifacts dating from approximately 4000 to 2500 BC are rare, but all known examples contain specific alloys of iron
and nickel that occur only in extraterrestrial objects, not on earth. It took thousands of years of technological advances
before civilizations developed iron smelting, the ability to extract a pure element from its naturally occurring ores
and for iron tools to become common.
Figure 19.5 Transition metals occur in nature in various forms. Examples include (a) a nugget of copper, (b) a
deposit of gold, and (c) an ore containing oxidized iron. (credit a: modification of work by http://images-of-
elements.com/copper-2.jpg; credit c: modification of work by http://images-of-elements.com/iron-ore.jpg)
Generally, the transition elements are extracted from minerals found in a variety of ores. However, the ease of their
recovery varies widely, depending on the concentration of the element in the ore, the identity of the other elements
present, and the difficulty of reducing the element to the free metal.
In general, it is not difficult to reduce ions of the d-block elements to the free element. Carbon is a sufficiently
strong reducing agent in most cases. However, like the ions of the more active main group metals, ions of the f-block
elements must be isolated by electrolysis or by reduction with an active metal such as calcium.
We shall discuss the processes used for the isolation of iron, copper, and silver because these three processes illustrate
1034 Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
the principal means of isolating most of the d-block metals. In general, each of these processes involves three principal
steps: preliminary treatment, smelting, and refining.
1. Preliminary treatment. In general, there is an initial treatment of the ores to make them suitable for the
extraction of the metals. This usually involves crushing or grinding the ore, concentrating the metal-bearing
components, and sometimes treating these substances chemically to convert them into compounds that are
easier to reduce to the metal.
2. Smelting. The next step is the extraction of the metal in the molten state, a process called smelting, which
includes reduction of the metallic compound to the metal. Impurities may be removed by the addition of a
compound that forms a slag—a substance with a low melting point that can be readily separated from the
molten metal.
3. Refining. The final step in the recovery of a metal is refining the metal. Low boiling metals such as zinc and
mercury can be refined by distillation. When fused on an inclined table, low melting metals like tin flow away
from higher-melting impurities. Electrolysis is another common method for refining metals.
Isolation of Iron
The early application of iron to the manufacture of tools and weapons was possible because of the wide distribution
of iron ores and the ease with which iron compounds in the ores could be reduced by carbon. For a long time, charcoal
was the form of carbon used in the reduction process. The production and use of iron became much more widespread
about 1620, when coke was introduced as the reducing agent. Coke is a form of carbon formed by heating coal in the
absence of air to remove impurities.
The first step in the metallurgy of iron is usually roasting the ore (heating the ore in air) to remove water, decomposing
carbonates into oxides, and converting sulfides into oxides. The oxides are then reduced in a blast furnace that is
80–100 feet high and about 25 feet in diameter (Figure 19.6) in which the roasted ore, coke, and limestone (impure
CaCO3) are introduced continuously into the top. Molten iron and slag are withdrawn at the bottom. The entire stock
in a furnace may weigh several hundred tons.
Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 1035
Figure 19.6 Within a blast furnace, different reactions occur in different temperature zones. Carbon monoxide is
generated in the hotter bottom regions and rises upward to reduce the iron oxides to pure iron through a series of
reactions that take place in the upper regions.
Near the bottom of a furnace are nozzles through which preheated air is blown into the furnace. As soon as the air
enters, the coke in the region of the nozzles is oxidized to carbon dioxide with the liberation of a great deal of heat.
The hot carbon dioxide passes upward through the overlying layer of white-hot coke, where it is reduced to carbon
monoxide:
CO2(g) + C(s) ⟶ 2CO(g)
The carbon monoxide serves as the reducing agent in the upper regions of the furnace. The individual reactions are
indicated in Figure 19.6.
The iron oxides are reduced in the upper region of the furnace. In the middle region, limestone (calcium carbonate)
decomposes, and the resulting calcium oxide combines with silica and silicates in the ore to form slag. The slag is
mostly calcium silicate and contains most of the commercially unimportant components of the ore:
CaO(s) + SiO2(s) ⟶ CaSiO3(l)
Just below the middle of the furnace, the temperature is high enough to melt both the iron and the slag. They collect
in layers at the bottom of the furnace; the less dense slag floats on the iron and protects it from oxidation. Several
times a day, the slag and molten iron are withdrawn from the furnace. The iron is transferred to casting machines or
to a steelmaking plant (Figure 19.7).

Figure 19.7 Molten iron is shown being cast as steel. (credit: Clint Budd)
Much of the iron produced is refined and converted into steel. Steel is made from iron by removing impurities
and adding substances such as manganese, chromium, nickel, tungsten, molybdenum, and vanadium to produce
alloys with properties that make the material suitable for specific uses. Most steels also contain small but definite
percentages of carbon (0.04%–2.5%). However, a large part of the carbon contained in iron must be removed in the
manufacture of steel; otherwise, the excess carbon would make the iron brittle.
You can watch an animation of steelmaking (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16steelmaking) that walks
you through the process.
Isolation of Copper
The most important ores of copper contain copper sulfides (such as covellite, CuS), although copper oxides (such
as tenorite, CuO) and copper hydroxycarbonates [such as malachite, Cu2(OH)2CO3] are sometimes found. In the
production of copper metal, the concentrated sulfide ore is roasted to remove part of the sulfur as sulfur dioxide. The
remaining mixture, which consists of Cu2S, FeS, FeO, and SiO2, is mixed with limestone, which serves as a flux (a
material that aids in the removal of impurities), and heated. Molten slag forms as the iron and silica are removed by
Lewis acid-base reactions:
CaCO3(s) + SiO2(s) ⟶ CaSiO3(l) + CO2(g)
FeO(s) + SiO2(s) ⟶ FeSiO3(l)
In these reactions, the silicon dioxide behaves as a Lewis acid, which accepts a pair of electrons from the Lewis base
(the oxide ion).
Reduction of the Cu2S that remains after smelting is accomplished by blowing air through the molten material. The
air converts part of the Cu2S into Cu2O. As soon as copper(I) oxide is formed, it is reduced by the remaining copper(I)

sulfide to metallic copper:
2Cu2 S(l) + 3O2(g) ⟶ 2Cu2 O(l) + 2SO2(g)
2Cu2 O(l) + Cu2 S(l) ⟶ 6Cu(l) + SO2(g)
The copper obtained in this way is called blister copper because of its characteristic appearance, which is due to the
air blisters it contains (Figure 19.8). This impure copper is cast into large plates, which are used as anodes in the
electrolytic refining of the metal (which is described in the chapter on electrochemistry).

Isolation of Silver
Silver sometimes occurs in large nuggets (Figure 19.9) but more frequently in veins and related deposits. At one
time, panning was an effective method of isolating both silver and gold nuggets. Due to their low reactivity, these
metals, and a few others, occur in deposits as nuggets. The discovery of platinum was due to Spanish explorers in
Central America mistaking platinum nuggets for silver. When the metal is not in the form of nuggets, it often useful
to employ a process called hydrometallurgy to separate silver from its ores. Hydrology involves the separation of
a metal from a mixture by first converting it into soluble ions and then extracting and reducing them to precipitate
the pure metal. In the presence of air, alkali metal cyanides readily form the soluble dicyanoargentate(I) ion,

⎣Ag(CN)2⎤
⎦−(aq)?
Solution
The charges, as well as the atoms, must balance in reactions. The silver atom is being oxidized from the 0
oxidation state to the 1+ state. Whenever something loses electrons, something must also gain electrons (be
reduced) to balance the equation. Oxygen is a good oxidizing agent for these reactions because it can gain
electrons to go from the 0 oxidation state to the 2− state.

During the refining of iron, carbon must be present in the blast furnace. Why is carbon necessary to convert
iron oxide into iron?
Answer: The carbon is converted into CO, which is the reducing agent that accepts electrons so that
iron(III) can be reduced to iron(0).
Transition Metal Compounds
The bonding in the simple compounds of the transition elements ranges from ionic to covalent. In their lower
oxidation states, the transition elements form ionic compounds; in their higher oxidation states, they form covalent
compounds or polyatomic ions. The variation in oxidation states exhibited by the transition elements gives these
compounds a metal-based, oxidation-reduction chemistry. The chemistry of several classes of compounds containing
elements of the transition series follows.
Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 1039
Halides
Anhydrous halides of each of the transition elements can be prepared by the direct reaction of the metal with halogens.
For example:
2Fe(s) + 3Cl2(g) ⟶ 2FeCl3(s)
Heating a metal halide with additional metal can be used to form a halide of the metal with a lower oxidation state:
Fe(s) + 2FeCl3(s) ⟶ 3FeCl2(s)
The stoichiometry of the metal halide that results from the reaction of the metal with a halogen is determined by the
relative amounts of metal and halogen and by the strength of the halogen as an oxidizing agent. Generally, fluorine
forms fluoride-containing metals in their highest oxidation states. The other halogens may not form analogous
compounds.
In general, the preparation of stable water solutions of the halides of the metals of the first transition series is by the
addition of a hydrohalic acid to carbonates, hydroxides, oxides, or other compounds that contain basic anions. Sample
reactions are:
NiCO3(s) + 2HF(aq) ⟶ NiF2(aq) + H2 O(l) + CO2(g)
Co(OH)2(s) + 2HBr(aq) ⟶ CoBr2(aq) + 2H2 O(l)
Most of the first transition series metals also dissolve in acids, forming a solution of the salt and hydrogen gas. For
example:
Cr(s) + 2HCl(aq) ⟶ CrCl2(aq) + H2(g)
The polarity of bonds with transition metals varies based not only upon the electronegativities of the atoms involved
but also upon the oxidation state of the transition metal. Remember that bond polarity is a continuous spectrum
with electrons being shared evenly (covalent bonds) at one extreme and electrons being transferred completely (ionic
bonds) at the other. No bond is ever 100% ionic, and the degree to which the electrons are evenly distributed
determines many properties of the compound. Transition metal halides with low oxidation numbers form more
ionic bonds. For example, titanium(II) chloride and titanium(III) chloride (TiCl2 and TiCl3) have high melting
points that are characteristic of ionic compounds, but titanium(IV) chloride (TiCl4) is a volatile liquid, consistent
with having covalent titanium-chlorine bonds. All halides of the heavier d-block elements have significant covalent
characteristics.
The covalent behavior of the transition metals with higher oxidation states is exemplified by the reaction of the metal
tetrahalides with water. Like covalent silicon tetrachloride, both the titanium and vanadium tetrahalides react with
water to give solutions containing the corresponding hydrohalic acids and the metal oxides:
SiCl4(l) + 2H2 O(l) ⟶ SiO2(s) + 4HCl(aq)
TiCl4(l) + 2H2 O(l) ⟶ TiO2(s) + 4HCl(aq)
Oxides
As with the halides, the nature of bonding in oxides of the transition elements is determined by the oxidation state of
the metal. Oxides with low oxidation states tend to be more ionic, whereas those with higher oxidation states are more
covalent. These variations in bonding are because the electronegativities of the elements are not fixed values. The
electronegativity of an element increases with increasing oxidation state. Transition metals in low oxidation states
have lower electronegativity values than oxygen; therefore, these metal oxides are ionic. Transition metals in very
high oxidation states have electronegativity values close to that of oxygen, which leads to these oxides being covalent.
The oxides of the first transition series can be prepared by heating the metals in air. These oxides are Sc2O3, TiO2,
V2O5, Cr2O3, Mn3O4, Fe3O4, Co3O4, NiO, and CuO.
Alternatively, these oxides and other oxides (with the metals in different oxidation states) can be produced by heating
the corresponding hydroxides, carbonates, or oxalates in an inert atmosphere. Iron(II) oxide can be prepared by
heating iron(II) oxalate, and cobalt(II) oxide is produced by heating cobalt(II) hydroxide:
1040 Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry

FeC2 O4(s) ⟶ FeO(s) + CO(g) + CO2(g)
Co(OH)2(s) ⟶ CoO(s) + H2 O(g)
With the exception of CrO3 and Mn2O7, transition metal oxides are not soluble in water. They can react with acids
and, in a few cases, with bases. Overall, oxides of transition metals with the lowest oxidation states are basic (and
react with acids), the intermediate ones are amphoteric, and the highest oxidation states are primarily acidic. Basic
metal oxides at a low oxidation state react with aqueous acids to form solutions of salts and water. Examples include
the reaction of cobalt(II) oxide accepting protons from nitric acid, and scandium(III) oxide accepting protons from
hydrochloric acid:
CoO(s) + 2HNO3(aq) ⟶ Co(NO3)2(aq) + H2 O(l)
Sc2 O3(s) + 6HCl(aq) ⟶ 2ScCl3(aq) + 3H2 O(l)
The oxides of metals with oxidation states of 4+ are amphoteric, and most are not soluble in either acids or
bases. Vanadium(V) oxide, chromium(VI) oxide, and manganese(VII) oxide are acidic. They react with solutions
of hydroxides to form salts of the oxyanions VO 4 3−, CrO4 2−, and MnO4 − . For example, the complete ionic
equation for the reaction of chromium(VI) oxide with a strong base is given by:
CrO3(s) + 2Na+(aq) + 2OH−(aq) ⟶ 2Na+(aq) + CrO4 2−(aq) + H2 O(l)
Chromium(VI) oxide and manganese(VII) oxide react with water to form the acids H2CrO4 and HMnO4, respectively.
Hydroxides
When a soluble hydroxide is added to an aqueous solution of a salt of a transition metal of the first transition series,
a gelatinous precipitate forms. For example, adding a solution of sodium hydroxide to a solution of cobalt sulfate
produces a gelatinous pink or blue precipitate of cobalt(II) hydroxide. The net ionic equation is:
Co2+(aq) + 2OH−(aq) ⟶ Co(OH)2(s)
In this and many other cases, these precipitates are hydroxides containing the transition metal ion, hydroxide ions,
and water coordinated to the transition metal. In other cases, the precipitates are hydrated oxides composed of the
metal ion, oxide ions, and water of hydration:
4Fe3+(aq) + 6OH−(aq) + n H2 O(l) ⟶ 2Fe2 O3 ·(n + 3)H2 O(s)
These substances do not contain hydroxide ions. However, both the hydroxides and the hydrated oxides react with
acids to form salts and water. When precipitating a metal from solution, it is necessary to avoid an excess of hydroxide
ion, as this may lead to complex ion formation as discussed later in this chapter. The precipitated metal hydroxides
can be separated for further processing or for waste disposal.
Carbonates
Many of the elements of the first transition series form insoluble carbonates. It is possible to prepare these carbonates
by the addition of a soluble carbonate salt to a solution of a transition metal salt. For example, nickel carbonate can
be prepared from solutions of nickel nitrate and sodium carbonate according to the following net ionic equation:
Ni2+(aq) + CO3 2− ⟶ NiCO3(s)
The reactions of the transition metal carbonates are similar to those of the active metal carbonates. They react with
acids to form metals salts, carbon dioxide, and water. Upon heating, they decompose, forming the transition metal
oxides.
Other Salts
In many respects, the chemical behavior of the elements of the first transition series is very similar to that of the main
group metals. In particular, the same types of reactions that are used to prepare salts of the main group metals can be
used to prepare simple ionic salts of these elements.
Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 1041
A variety of salts can be prepared from metals that are more active than hydrogen by reaction with the corresponding
acids: Scandium metal reacts with hydrobromic acid to form a solution of scandium bromide:
2Sc(s) + 6HBr(aq) ⟶ 2ScBr3(aq) + 3H2(g)
The common compounds that we have just discussed can also be used to prepare salts. The reactions involved include
the reactions of oxides, hydroxides, or carbonates with acids. For example:
Ni(OH)2(s) + 2H3 O+(aq) + 2ClO4 −(aq) ⟶ Ni2+(aq) + 2ClO4 −(aq) + 4H2 O(l)
Substitution reactions involving soluble salts may be used to prepare insoluble salts. For example:
Ba2+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq) + 2K+(aq) + CrO4 2−(aq) ⟶ BaCrO4(s) + 2K+(aq) + 2Cl−(aq)
In our discussion of oxides in this section, we have seen that reactions of the covalent oxides of the transition elements
with hydroxides form salts that contain oxyanions of the transition elements.
High Temperature Superconductors
A superconductor is a substance that conducts electricity with no resistance. This lack of resistance means
that there is no energy loss during the transmission of electricity. This would lead to a significant reduction in
the cost of electricity.
Most currently used, commercial superconducting materials, such as NbTi and Nb3Sn, do not become
superconducting until they are cooled below 23 K (−250 °C). This requires the use of liquid helium, which has
a boiling temperature of 4 K and is expensive and difficult to handle. The cost of liquid helium has deterred the
widespread application of superconductors.
One of the most exciting scientific discoveries of the 1980s was the characterization of compounds that exhibit
superconductivity at temperatures above 90 K. (Compared to liquid helium, 90 K is a high temperature.) Typical
among the high-temperature superconducting materials are oxides containing yttrium (or one of several rare
earth elements), barium, and copper in a 1:2:3 ratio. The formula of the ionic yttrium compound is YBa2Cu3O7.
The new materials become superconducting at temperatures close to 90 K (Figure 19.10), temperatures that
can be reached by cooling with liquid nitrogen (boiling temperature of 77 K). Not only are liquid nitrogen-cooled
materials easier to handle, but the cooling costs are also about 1000 times lower than for liquid helium.

Figure 19.10 The resistance of the high-temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O7 varies with temperature.
Note how the resistance falls to zero below 92 K, when the substance becomes superconducting.
Although the brittle, fragile nature of these materials presently hampers their commercial applications, they
have tremendous potential that researchers are hard at work improving their processes to help realize.
Superconducting transmission lines would carry current for hundreds of miles with no loss of power due to
resistance in the wires. This could allow generating stations to be located in areas remote from population
centers and near the natural resources necessary for power production. The first project demonstrating the
viability of high-temperature superconductor power transmission was established in New York in 2008.
Researchers are also working on using this technology to develop other applications, such as smaller and
more powerful microchips. In addition, high-temperature superconductors can be used to generate magnetic
fields for applications such as medical devices, magnetic levitation trains, and containment fields for nuclear
fusion reactors (Figure 19.11).

19.2 Coordination Chemistry of Transition Metals
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• List the defining traits of coordination compounds
• Describe the structures of complexes containing monodentate and polydentate ligands
• Use standard nomenclature rules to name coordination compounds
• Explain and provide examples of geometric and optical isomerism
• Identify several natural and technological occurrences of coordination compounds
The hemoglobin in your blood, the chlorophyll in green plants, vitamin B-12, and the catalyst used in the manufacture
of polyethylene all contain coordination compounds. Ions of the metals, especially the transition metals, are likely to
form complexes. Many of these compounds are highly colored (Figure 19.12). In the remainder of this chapter, we
will consider the structure and bonding of these remarkable compounds.
Figure 19.12 Metal ions that contain partially filled d subshell usually form colored complex ions; ions with empty d
subshell (d0) or with filled d subshells (d10) usually form colorless complexes. This figure shows, from left to right,
solutions containing [M(H2O)6]n+ ions with M = Sc3+(d0), Cr3+(d3), Co2+(d7), Ni2+(d8), Cu2+(d9), and Zn2+(d10). (credit:

Remember that in most main group element compounds, the valence electrons of the isolated atoms combine to form
chemical bonds that satisfy the octet rule. For instance, the four valence electrons of carbon overlap with electrons
from four hydrogen atoms to form CH4. The one valence electron leaves sodium and adds to the seven valence
electrons of chlorine to form the ionic formula unit NaCl (Figure 19.13). Transition metals do not normally bond
in this fashion. They primarily form coordinate covalent bonds, a form of the Lewis acid-base interaction in which
both of the electrons in the bond are contributed by a donor (Lewis base) to an electron acceptor (Lewis acid). The
Lewis acid in coordination complexes, often called a central metal ion (or atom), is often a transition metal or inner
transition metal, although main group elements can also form coordination compounds. The Lewis base donors,
called ligands, can be a wide variety of chemicals—atoms, molecules, or ions. The only requirement is that they have

one or more electron pairs, which can be donated to the central metal. Most often, this involves a donor atom with a
lone pair of electrons that can form a coordinate bond to the metal.
Figure 19.13 (a) Covalent bonds involve the sharing of electrons, and ionic bonds involve the transferring of
electrons associated with each bonding atom, as indicated by the colored electrons. (b) However, coordinate covalent
bonds involve electrons from a Lewis base being donated to a metal center. The lone pairs from six water molecules
form bonds to the scandium ion to form an octahedral complex. (Only the donated pairs are shown.)
The coordination sphere consists of the central metal ion or atom plus its attached ligands. Brackets in a formula
enclose the coordination sphere; species outside the brackets are not part of the coordination sphere. The
coordination number of the central metal ion or atom is the number of donor atoms bonded to it. The coordination
number for the silver ion in [Ag(NH3)2]+ is two (Figure 19.14). For the copper(II) ion in [CuCl4]2−, the coordination
number is four, whereas for the cobalt(II) ion in [Co(H2O)6]2+ the coordination number is six. Each of these ligands is
monodentate, from the Greek for “one toothed,” meaning that they connect with the central metal through only one
atom. In this case, the number of ligands and the coordination number are equal.
Figure 19.14 The complexes (a) [Ag(NH3)2]+, (b) [Cu(Cl)4]2−, and (c) [Co(H2O)6]2+ have coordination numbers of
two, four, and six, respectively. The geometries of these complexes are the same as we have seen with VSEPR
theory for main group elements: linear, tetrahedral, and octahedral.
Many other ligands coordinate to the metal in more complex fashions. Bidentate ligands are those in which two
atoms coordinate to the metal center. For example, ethylenediamine (en, H2NCH2CH2NH2) contains two nitrogen
atoms, each of which has a lone pair and can serve as a Lewis base (Figure 19.15). Both of the atoms can coordinate
to a single metal center. In the complex [Co(en)3]3+, there are three bidentate en ligands, and the coordination number
of the cobalt(III) ion is six. The most common coordination numbers are two, four, and six, but examples of all
coordination numbers from 1 to 15 are known.
Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 1045
Figure 19.15 (a) The ethylenediamine (en) ligand contains two atoms with lone pairs that can coordinate to the
metal center. (b) The cobalt(III) complex ⎡
⎣Co(en)3⎤
⎦
3+ contains three of these ligands, each forming two bonds to the
cobalt ion.
Any ligand that bonds to a central metal ion by more than one donor atom is a polydentate ligand (or “many teeth”)
because it can bite into the metal center with more than one bond. The term chelate (pronounced “KEY-late”) from
the Greek for “claw” is also used to describe this type of interaction. Many polydentate ligands are chelating ligands,
and a complex consisting of one or more of these ligands and a central metal is a chelate. A chelating ligand is also
known as a chelating agent. A chelating ligand holds the metal ion rather like a crab’s claw would hold a marble.
Figure 19.15 showed one example of a chelate. The heme complex in hemoglobin is another important example
(Figure 19.16). It contains a polydentate ligand with four donor atoms that coordinate to iron.
Figure 19.16 The single ligand heme contains four nitrogen atoms that coordinate to iron in hemoglobin to form a
chelate.
Polydentate ligands are sometimes identified with prefixes that indicate the number of donor atoms in the ligand.
As we have seen, ligands with one donor atom, such as NH3, Cl−, and H2O, are monodentate ligands. Ligands
with two donor groups are bidentate ligands. Ethylenediamine, H2NCH2CH2NH2, and the anion of the acid glycine,
NH2 CH2 CO2 − (Figure 19.17) are examples of bidentate ligands. Tridentate ligands, tetradentate ligands,
pentadentate ligands, and hexadentate ligands contain three, four, five, and six donor atoms, respectively. The ligand
in heme (Figure 19.16) is a tetradentate ligand.

and oxygen atom coordinating to the metal.
The Naming of Complexes
The nomenclature of the complexes is patterned after a system suggested by Alfred Werner, a Swiss chemist and
Nobel laureate, whose outstanding work more than 100 years ago laid the foundation for a clearer understanding of
these compounds. The following five rules are used for naming complexes:
1. If a coordination compound is ionic, name the cation first and the anion second, in accordance with the usual
nomenclature.
2. Name the ligands first, followed by the central metal. Name the ligands alphabetically. Negative ligands
(anions) have names formed by adding -o to the stem name of the group. For examples, see Table 19.1.
For most neutral ligands, the name of the molecule is used. The four common exceptions are aqua (H2O),
ammine (NH3), carbonyl (CO), and nitrosyl (NO). For example, name [Pt(NH3)2Cl4] as
diamminetetrachloroplatinum(IV).
Examples of Anionic Ligands
Anionic Ligand Name
F− fluoro
Cl− chloro
Br− bromo
I− iodo
CN− cyano
NO3 − nitrato
OH− hydroxo
O2– oxo
C2 O4 2− oxalato
CO2 2− carbonato
Table 19.1
3. If more than one ligand of a given type is present, the number is indicated by the prefixes di- (for two), tri-
(for three), tetra- (for four), penta- (for five), and hexa- (for six). Sometimes, the prefixes bis- (for two), tris-
(for three), and tetrakis- (for four) are used when the name of the ligand already includes di-, tri-, or tetra-, or
when the ligand name begins with a vowel. For example, the ion bis(bipyridyl)osmium(II) uses bis- to signify
that there are two ligands attached to Os, and each bipyridyl ligand contains two pyridine groups (C5H4N).
When the complex is either a cation or a neutral molecule, the name of the central metal atom is spelled exactly like
the name of the element and is followed by a Roman numeral in parentheses to indicate its oxidation state (Table
19.2 and Table 19.3). When the complex is an anion, the suffix -ate is added to the stem of the name of the metal,
Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 1047
followed by the Roman numeral designation of its oxidation state (Table 19.4). Sometimes, the Latin name of the
metal is used when the English name is clumsy. For example, ferrate is used instead of ironate, plumbate instead
leadate, and stannate instead of tinate. The oxidation state of the metal is determined based on the charges of each
ligand and the overall charge of the coordination compound. For example, in [Cr(H2O)4Cl2]Br, the coordination
sphere (in brackets) has a charge of 1+ to balance the bromide ion. The water ligands are neutral, and the chloride
ligands are anionic with a charge of 1− each. To determine the oxidation state of the metal, we set the overall charge
equal to the sum of the ligands and the metal: +1 = −2 + x, so the oxidation state (x) is equal to 3+.

(b) K3[Fe(C2O4)3]
(c) [Co(NH3)5Cl]Cl2
Solution
(a) There are two Na+ ions, so the coordination sphere has a negative two charge: [PtCl6]2−. There are
six anionic chloride ligands, so −2 = −6 + x, and the oxidation state of the platinum is 4+. The name of
the complex is sodium hexachloroplatinate(IV), and the coordination number is six. (b) The coordination
sphere has a charge of 3− (based on the potassium) and the oxalate ligands each have a charge of 2−, so
the metal oxidation state is given by −3 = −6 + x, and this is an iron(III) complex. The name is potassium
trisoxalatoferrate(III) (note that tris is used instead of tri because the ligand name starts with a vowel).
Because oxalate is a bidentate ligand, this complex has a coordination number of six. (c) In this example, the
coordination sphere has a cationic charge of 2+. The NH3 ligand is neutral, but the chloro ligand has a charge
of 1−. The oxidation state is found by +2 = −1 + x and is 3+, so the complex is pentaamminechlorocobalt(III)
chloride and the coordination number is six.

The Structures of Complexes
The most common structures of the complexes in coordination compounds are octahedral, tetrahedral, and square
planar (see Figure 19.18). For transition metal complexes, the coordination number determines the geometry around
the central metal ion. Table 19.5 compares coordination numbers to the molecular geometry:
Figure 19.18 These are geometries of some complexes with coordination numbers of seven and eight.

Table 19.5
Unlike main group atoms in which both the bonding and nonbonding electrons determine the molecular shape, the
nonbonding d-electrons do not change the arrangement of the ligands. Octahedral complexes have a coordination
number of six, and the six donor atoms are arranged at the corners of an octahedron around the central metal ion.
Examples are shown in Figure 19.19. The chloride and nitrate anions in [Co(H2O)6]Cl2 and [Cr(en)3](NO3)3, and
the potassium cations in K2[PtCl6], are outside the brackets and are not bonded to the metal ion.
Figure 19.19 Many transition metal complexes adopt octahedral geometries, with six donor atoms forming bond
angles of 90° about the central atom with adjacent ligands. Note that only ligands within the coordination sphere
affect the geometry around the metal center.
For transition metals with a coordination number of four, two different geometries are possible: tetrahedral or square
planar. Unlike main group elements, where these geometries can be predicted from VSEPR theory, a more detailed
discussion of transition metal orbitals (discussed in the section on Crystal Field Theory) is required to predict which
complexes will be tetrahedral and which will be square planar. In tetrahedral complexes such as [Zn(CN)4]2− (Figure
19.20), each of the ligand pairs forms an angle of 109.5°. In square planar complexes, such as [Pt(NH3)2Cl2], each
ligand has two other ligands at 90° angles (called the cis positions) and one additional ligand at an 180° angle, in the
trans position.

K2[Zn(CN)4] or a square planar geometry (b) as shown in [Pt(NH3)2Cl2].
Isomerism in Complexes
Isomers are different chemical species that have the same chemical formula. Transition metals often form geometric
isomers, in which the same atoms are connected through the same types of bonds but with differences in their
orientation in space. Coordination complexes with two different ligands in the cis and trans positions from a ligand
of interest form isomers. For example, the octahedral [Co(NH3)4Cl2]+ ion has two isomers. In the cis configuration,
the two chloride ligands are adjacent to each other (Figure 19.21). The other isomer, the trans configuration, has
the two chloride ligands directly across from one another.
Figure 19.21 The cis and trans isomers of [Co(H2O)4Cl2]+ contain the same ligands attached to the same metal ion,
but the spatial arrangement causes these two compounds to have very different properties.
Different geometric isomers of a substance are different chemical compounds. They exhibit different properties, even
though they have the same formula. For example, the two isomers of [Co(NH3)4Cl2]NO3 differ in color; the cis form
is violet, and the trans form is green. Furthermore, these isomers have different dipole moments, solubilities, and
reactivities. As an example of how the arrangement in space can influence the molecular properties, consider the
polarity of the two [Co(NH3)4Cl2]NO3 isomers. Remember that the polarity of a molecule or ion is determined by
the bond dipoles (which are due to the difference in electronegativity of the bonding atoms) and their arrangement
in space. In one isomer, cis chloride ligands cause more electron density on one side of the molecule than on the
other, making it polar. For the trans isomer, each ligand is directly across from an identical ligand, so the bond dipoles
cancel out, and the molecule is nonpolar.

Answer:
Another important type of isomers are optical isomers, or enantiomers, in which two objects are exact mirror images
of each other but cannot be lined up so that all parts match. This means that optical isomers are nonsuperimposable
mirror images. A classic example of this is a pair of hands, in which the right and left hand are mirror images of one
another but cannot be superimposed. Optical isomers are very important in organic and biochemistry because living
systems often incorporate one specific optical isomer and not the other. Unlike geometric isomers, pairs of optical
isomers have identical properties (boiling point, polarity, solubility, etc.). Optical isomers differ only in the way they
affect polarized light and how they react with other optical isomers. For coordination complexes, many coordination
compounds such as [M(en)3]n+ [in which Mn+ is a central metal ion such as iron(III) or cobalt(II)] form enantiomers,
as shown in Figure 19.23. These two isomers will react differently with other optical isomers. For example, DNA
helices are optical isomers, and the form that occurs in nature (right-handed DNA) will bind to only one isomer of
[M(en)3]n+ and not the other.
Figure 19.23 The complex [M(en)3]n+ (Mn+ = a metal ion, en = ethylenediamine) has a nonsuperimposable mirror
image.
The [Co(en)2Cl2]+ ion exhibits geometric isomerism (cis/trans), and its cis isomer exists as a pair of optical isomers
(Figure 19.24).

Figure 19.24 Three isomeric forms of [Co(en)2Cl2]+ exist. The trans isomer, formed when the chlorines are
positioned at a 180° angle, has very different properties from the cis isomers. The mirror images of the cis isomer
form a pair of optical isomers, which have identical behavior except when reacting with other enantiomers.
Linkage isomers occur when the coordination compound contains a ligand that can bind to the transition metal center
through two different atoms. For example, the CN ligand can bind through the carbon atom (cyano) or through the
nitrogen atom (isocyano). Similarly, SCN− can be bound through the sulfur or nitrogen atom, affording two distinct
compounds ([Co(NH3)5SCN]2+ or [Co(NH3)5NCS]2+).
Ionization isomers (or coordination isomers) occur when one anionic ligand in the inner coordination sphere is
replaced with the counter ion from the outer coordination sphere. A simple example of two ionization isomers are
[CoCl6][Br] and [CoCl5Br][Cl].
Coordination Complexes in Nature and Technology
Chlorophyll, the green pigment in plants, is a complex that contains magnesium (Figure 19.25). This is an example
of a main group element in a coordination complex. Plants appear green because chlorophyll absorbs red and purple
light; the reflected light consequently appears green. The energy resulting from the absorption of light is used in
photosynthesis.

magnesium center. (b) Copper phthalocyanine blue, a square planar copper complex, is present in some blue dyes.

Transition Metal Catalysts
One of the most important applications of transition metals is as industrial catalysts. As you recall from
the chapter on kinetics, a catalyst increases the rate of reaction by lowering the activation energy and is
regenerated in the catalytic cycle. Over 90% of all manufactured products are made with the aid of one
or more catalysts. The ability to bind ligands and change oxidation states makes transition metal catalysts
well suited for catalytic applications. Vanadium oxide is used to produce 230,000,000 tons of sulfuric acid
worldwide each year, which in turn is used to make everything from fertilizers to cans for food. Plastics are
made with the aid of transition metal catalysts, along with detergents, fertilizers, paints, and more (see Figure
19.26). Very complicated pharmaceuticals are manufactured with catalysts that are selective, reacting with one
specific bond out of a large number of possibilities. Catalysts allow processes to be more economical and more
environmentally friendly. Developing new catalysts and better understanding of existing systems are important
areas of current research.

The structure of heme (Figure 19.29), the iron-containing complex in hemoglobin, is very similar to that in
chlorophyll. In hemoglobin, the red heme complex is bonded to a large protein molecule (globin) by the attachment of
the protein to the heme ligand. Oxygen molecules are transported by hemoglobin in the blood by being bound to the
iron center. When the hemoglobin loses its oxygen, the color changes to a bluish red. Hemoglobin will only transport
oxygen if the iron is Fe2+; oxidation of the iron to Fe3+ prevents oxygen transport.
Figure 19.29 Hemoglobin contains four protein subunits, each of which has an iron center attached to a heme
ligand (shown in red), which is coordinated to a globin protein. Each subunit is shown in a different color.
Complexing agents often are used for water softening because they tie up such ions as Ca2+, Mg2+, and Fe2+, which
make water hard. Many metal ions are also undesirable in food products because these ions can catalyze reactions
that change the color of food. Coordination complexes are useful as preservatives. For example, the ligand EDTA,
(HO2CCH2)2NCH2CH2N(CH2CO2H)2, coordinates to metal ions through six donor atoms and prevents the metals
from reacting (Figure 19.30). This ligand also is used to sequester metal ions in paper production, textiles, and
detergents, and has pharmaceutical uses.

Complexing agents that tie up metal ions are also used as drugs. British Anti-Lewisite (BAL),
HSCH2CH(SH)CH2OH, is a drug developed during World War I as an antidote for the arsenic-based war gas
Lewisite. BAL is now used to treat poisoning by heavy metals, such as arsenic, mercury, thallium, and chromium. The
drug is a ligand and functions by making a water-soluble chelate of the metal; the kidneys eliminate this metal chelate
(Figure 19.31). Another polydentate ligand, enterobactin, which is isolated from certain bacteria, is used to form
complexes of iron and thereby to control the severe iron buildup found in patients suffering from blood diseases such
as Cooley’s anemia, who require frequent transfusions. As the transfused blood breaks down, the usual metabolic
processes that remove iron are overloaded, and excess iron can build up to fatal levels. Enterobactin forms a water-
soluble complex with excess iron, and the body can safely eliminate this complex.

Chelation Therapy
Ligands like BAL and enterobactin are important in medical treatments for heavy metal poisoning.
However, chelation therapies can disrupt the normal concentration of ions in the body, leading to serious
side effects, so researchers are searching for new chelation drugs. One drug that has been developed is

as donor atoms.
Figure 19.32 Dimercaptosuccinic acid is used to treat heavy metal poisoning.
Solution
All of the oxygen and sulfur atoms have lone pairs of electrons that can be used to coordinate to a metal
center, so there are six possible donor atoms. Geometrically, only two of these atoms can be coordinated
to a metal at once. The most common binding mode involves the coordination of one sulfur atom and one
oxygen atom, forming a five-member ring with the metal.

Ligands are also used in the electroplating industry. When metal ions are reduced to produce thin metal coatings,
metals can clump together to form clusters and nanoparticles. When metal coordination complexes are used, the
ligands keep the metal atoms isolated from each other. It has been found that many metals plate out as a smoother,
more uniform, better-looking, and more adherent surface when plated from a bath containing the metal as a complex
ion. Thus, complexes such as [Ag(CN)2]− and [Au(CN)2]− are used extensively in the electroplating industry.
In 1965, scientists at Michigan State University discovered that there was a platinum complex that inhibited cell
division in certain microorganisms. Later work showed that the complex was cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II),
[Pt(NH3)2(Cl)2], and that the trans isomer was not effective. The inhibition of cell division indicated that this square
planar compound could be an anticancer agent. In 1978, the US Food and Drug Administration approved this
compound, known as cisplatin, for use in the treatment of certain forms of cancer. Since that time, many similar
platinum compounds have been developed for the treatment of cancer. In all cases, these are the cis isomers and never
the trans isomers. The diammine (NH3)2 portion is retained with other groups, replacing the dichloro [(Cl)2] portion.
The newer drugs include carboplatin, oxaliplatin, and satraplatin.
19.3 Spectroscopic and Magnetic Properties of
Coordination Compounds
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Outline the basic premise of crystal field theory (CFT)
• Identify molecular geometries associated with various d-orbital splitting patterns
• Predict electron configurations of split d orbitals for selected transition metal atoms or ions
• Explain spectral and magnetic properties in terms of CFT concepts
The behavior of coordination compounds cannot be adequately explained by the same theories used for main group
element chemistry. The observed geometries of coordination complexes are not consistent with hybridized orbitals on
the central metal overlapping with ligand orbitals, as would be predicted by valence bond theory. The observed colors
indicate that the d orbitals often occur at different energy levels rather than all being degenerate, that is, of equal
energy, as are the three p orbitals. To explain the stabilities, structures, colors, and magnetic properties of transition
metal complexes, a different bonding model has been developed. Just as valence bond theory explains many aspects
of bonding in main group chemistry, crystal field theory is useful in understanding and predicting the behavior of
transition metal complexes.
Crystal Field Theory
To explain the observed behavior of transition metal complexes (such as how colors arise), a model involving
electrostatic interactions between the electrons from the ligands and the electrons in the unhybridized d orbitals of
the central metal atom has been developed. This electrostatic model is crystal field theory (CFT). It allows us to
understand, interpret, and predict the colors, magnetic behavior, and some structures of coordination compounds of
1. National Council against Health Fraud, NCAHF Policy Statement on Chelation Therapy, (Peabody, MA, 2002).
Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 1059
transition metals.
CFT focuses on the nonbonding electrons on the central metal ion in coordination complexes not on the metal-ligand
bonds. Like valence bond theory, CFT tells only part of the story of the behavior of complexes. However, it tells the
part that valence bond theory does not. In its pure form, CFT ignores any covalent bonding between ligands and metal
ions. Both the ligand and the metal are treated as infinitesimally small point charges.
All electrons are negative, so the electrons donated from the ligands will repel the electrons of the central metal. Let
us consider the behavior of the electrons in the unhybridized d orbitals in an octahedral complex. The five d orbitals
consist of lobe-shaped regions and are arranged in space, as shown in Figure 19.33. In an octahedral complex, the
six ligands coordinate along the axes.
Figure 19.33 The directional characteristics of the five d orbitals are shown here. The shaded portions indicate the
phase of the orbitals. The ligands (L) coordinate along the axes. For clarity, the ligands have been omitted from the
dx2 −y2 orbital so that the axis labels could be shown.
In an uncomplexed metal ion in the gas phase, the electrons are distributed among the five d orbitals in accord with
Hund's rule because the orbitals all have the same energy. However, when ligands coordinate to a metal ion, the
energies of the d orbitals are no longer the same.
In octahedral complexes, the lobes in two of the five d orbitals, the dz2 and dx2 −y2 orbitals, point toward the ligands
(Figure 19.33). These two orbitals are called the eg orbitals (the symbol actually refers to the symmetry of the
orbitals, but we will use it as a convenient name for these two orbitals in an octahedral complex). The other three
orbitals, the dxy, dxz, and dyz orbitals, have lobes that point between the ligands and are called the t2g orbitals (again,
the symbol really refers to the symmetry of the orbitals). As six ligands approach the metal ion along the axes of the
octahedron, their point charges repel the electrons in the d orbitals of the metal ion. However, the repulsions between
the electrons in the eg orbitals (the dz2 and dx2 −y2 orbitals) and the ligands are greater than the repulsions between
the electrons in the t2g orbitals (the dzy, dxz, and dyz orbitals) and the ligands. This is because the lobes of the eg orbitals
point directly at the ligands, whereas the lobes of the t2g orbitals point between them. Thus, electrons in the eg orbitals
of the metal ion in an octahedral complex have higher potential energies than those of electrons in the t2g orbitals. The
difference in energy may be represented as shown in Figure 19.34.

Figure 19.34 In octahedral complexes, the eg orbitals are destabilized (higher in energy) compared to the t2g orbitals
because the ligands interact more strongly with the d orbitals at which they are pointed directly.
The difference in energy between the eg and the t2g orbitals is called the crystal field splitting and is symbolized by
Δoct, where oct stands for octahedral.
The magnitude of Δoct depends on many factors, including the nature of the six ligands located around the central
metal ion, the charge on the metal, and whether the metal is using 3d, 4d, or 5d orbitals. Different ligands produce
different crystal field splittings. The increasing crystal field splitting produced by ligands is expressed in the
spectrochemical series, a short version of which is given here:

a few ligands of the spectrochemical series, in order of increasing field strength of the ligand
I− < Br− < Cl− < F− < H2 O < C2 O4 2− < NH3 < en < NO2 − < CN−
In this series, ligands on the left cause small crystal field splittings and are weak-field ligands, whereas those on the
right cause larger splittings and are strong-field ligands. Thus, the Δoct value for an octahedral complex with iodide
ligands (I−) is much smaller than the Δoct value for the same metal with cyanide ligands (CN−).
Electrons in the d orbitals follow the aufbau (“filling up”) principle, which says that the orbitals will be filled to give
the lowest total energy, just as in main group chemistry. When two electrons occupy the same orbital, the like charges
repel each other. The energy needed to pair up two electrons in a single orbital is called the pairing energy (P).
Electrons will always singly occupy each orbital in a degenerate set before pairing. P is similar in magnitude to Δoct.
When electrons fill the d orbitals, the relative magnitudes of Δoct and P determine which orbitals will be occupied.
In [Fe(CN)6]4−, the strong field of six cyanide ligands produces a large Δoct. Under these conditions, the electrons
require less energy to pair than they require to be excited to the eg orbitals (Δoct > P). The six 3d electrons of the Fe2+
ion pair in the three t2g orbitals (Figure 19.35). Complexes in which the electrons are paired because of the large
crystal field splitting are called low-spin complexes because the number of unpaired electrons (spins) is minimized.
Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 1061
Figure 19.35 Iron(II) complexes have six electrons in the 5d orbitals. In the absence of a crystal field, the orbitals
are degenerate. For coordination complexes with strong-field ligands such as [Fe(CN)6]4−, Δoct is greater than P, and
the electrons pair in the lower energy t2g orbitals before occupying the eg orbitals. With weak-field ligands such as
H2O, the ligand field splitting is less than the pairing energy, Δoct less than P, so the electrons occupy all d orbitals
singly before any pairing occurs.
In [Fe(H2O)6]2+, on the other hand, the weak field of the water molecules produces only a small crystal field splitting
(Δoct < P). Because it requires less energy for the electrons to occupy the eg orbitals than to pair together, there will
be an electron in each of the five 3d orbitals before pairing occurs. For the six d electrons on the iron(II) center in
[Fe(H2O)6]2+, there will be one pair of electrons and four unpaired electrons (Figure 19.35). Complexes such as the
[Fe(H2O)6]2+ ion, in which the electrons are unpaired because the crystal field splitting is not large enough to cause
them to pair, are called high-spin complexes because the number of unpaired electrons (spins) is maximized.
A similar line of reasoning shows why the [Fe(CN)6]3− ion is a low-spin complex with only one unpaired electron,
whereas both the [Fe(H2O)6]3+ and [FeF6]3− ions are high-spin complexes with five unpaired electrons.

Solution
The complexes are octahedral.
(a) Cr3+ has a d3 configuration. These electrons will all be unpaired.
(b) Cu2+ is d9, so there will be one unpaired electron.
(c) Co3+ has d6 valence electrons, so the crystal field splitting will determine how many are paired. Nitrite
is a strong-field ligand, so the complex will be low spin. Six electrons will go in the t2g orbitals, leaving 0
unpaired.

Answer: d4, d5, d6, and d7
Example 19.8
CFT for Other Geometries
CFT is applicable to molecules in geometries other than octahedral. In octahedral complexes, remember that
the lobes of the eg set point directly at the ligands. For tetrahedral complexes, the d orbitals remain in place,
but now we have only four ligands located between the axes (Figure 19.36). None of the orbitals points
directly at the tetrahedral ligands. However, the eg set (along the Cartesian axes) overlaps with the ligands
less than does the t2g set. By analogy with the octahedral case, predict the energy diagram for the d orbitals
in a tetrahedral crystal field. To avoid confusion, the octahedral eg set becomes a tetrahedral e set, and the
octahedral t2g set becomes a t2 set.
Figure 19.36 This diagram shows the orientation of the tetrahedral ligands with respect to the axis system
for the orbitals.
Solution
Since CFT is based on electrostatic repulsion, the orbitals closer to the ligands will be destabilized and
raised in energy relative to the other set of orbitals. The splitting is less than for octahedral complexes
because the overlap is less, so Δtet is usually small ⎛
⎝Δtet = 4

orbitals before pairing
The other common geometry is square planar. It is possible to consider a square planar geometry as an octahedral
structure with a pair of trans ligands removed. The removed ligands are assumed to be on the z-axis. This changes the
distribution of the d orbitals, as orbitals on or near the z-axis become more stable, and those on or near the x- or y-axes
become less stable. This results in the octahedral t2g and the eg sets splitting and gives a more complicated pattern
with no simple Δoct. The basic pattern is:
Magnetic Moments of Molecules and Ions
Experimental evidence of magnetic measurements supports the theory of high- and low-spin complexes. Remember
that molecules such as O2 that contain unpaired electrons are paramagnetic. Paramagnetic substances are attracted to
magnetic fields. Many transition metal complexes have unpaired electrons and hence are paramagnetic. Molecules
such as N2 and ions such as Na+ and [Fe(CN)6]4− that contain no unpaired electrons are diamagnetic. Diamagnetic
substances have a slight tendency to be repelled by magnetic fields.
When an electron in an atom or ion is unpaired, the magnetic moment due to its spin makes the entire atom or ion
paramagnetic. The size of the magnetic moment of a system containing unpaired electrons is related directly to the
number of such electrons: the greater the number of unpaired electrons, the larger the magnetic moment. Therefore,
the observed magnetic moment is used to determine the number of unpaired electrons present. The measured magnetic
moment of low-spin d6 [Fe(CN)6]4− confirms that iron is diamagnetic, whereas high-spin d6 [Fe(H2O)6]2+ has four
unpaired electrons with a magnetic moment that confirms this arrangement.
Colors of Transition Metal Complexes
When atoms or molecules absorb light at the proper frequency, their electrons are excited to higher-energy orbitals.
For many main group atoms and molecules, the absorbed photons are in the ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic
spectrum, which cannot be detected by the human eye. For coordination compounds, the energy difference between
the d orbitals often allows photons in the visible range to be absorbed.
The human eye perceives a mixture of all the colors, in the proportions present in sunlight, as white light.
Complementary colors, those located across from each other on a color wheel, are also used in color vision. The eye
perceives a mixture of two complementary colors, in the proper proportions, as white light. Likewise, when a color is
missing from white light, the eye sees its complement. For example, when red photons are absorbed from white light,
the eyes see the color green. When violet photons are removed from white light, the eyes see lemon yellow. The blue
color of the [Cu(NH3)4]2+ ion results because this ion absorbs orange and red light, leaving the complementary colors
of blue and green (Figure 19.37).

Figure 19.37 (a) An object is black if it absorbs all colors of light. If it reflects all colors of light, it is white. An object
has a color if it absorbs all colors except one, such as this yellow strip. The strip also appears yellow if it absorbs the
complementary color from white light (in this case, indigo). (b) Complementary colors are located directly across from
one another on the color wheel. (c) A solution of [Cu(NH3)4]2+ ions absorbs red and orange light, so the transmitted
light appears as the complementary color, blue.
Example 19.9
Colors of Complexes
The octahedral complex [Ti(H2O)6]3+ has a single d electron. To excite this electron from the ground state
t2g orbital to the eg orbital, this complex absorbs light from 450 to 600 nm. The maximum absorbance
corresponds to Δoct and occurs at 499 nm. Calculate the value of Δoct in Joules and predict what color the
solution will appear.
Solution
Using Planck's equation (refer to the section on electromagnetic energy), we calculate:
Chapter 19 | Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry 1065
v = c
λ so 3.00 × 108 m/s
499 nm × 1 m
109 nm
= 6.01 × 1014 Hz
E = hnu so 6.63 × 10−34 J·s × 6.01 × 1014 Hz = 3.99 × 10−19 Joules/ion
Because the complex absorbs 600 nm (orange) through 450 (blue), the indigo, violet, and red wavelengths
will be transmitted, and the complex will appear purple.

A complex that appears green, absorbs photons of what wavelengths?
Answer: red, 620–800 nm
Small changes in the relative energies of the orbitals that electrons are transitioning between can lead to drastic shifts
in the color of light absorbed. Therefore, the colors of coordination compounds depend on many factors. As shown
in Figure 19.38, different aqueous metal ions can have different colors. In addition, different oxidation states of one
metal can produce different colors, as shown for the vanadium complexes in the link below.
Figure 19.38 The partially filled d orbitals of the stable ions Cr3+(aq), Fe3+(aq), and Co2+(aq) (left, center and right,
respectively) give rise to various colors. (credit: Sahar Atwa)
The specific ligands coordinated to the metal center also influence the color of coordination complexes. For example,
the iron(II) complex [Fe(H2O)6]SO4 appears blue-green because the high-spin complex absorbs photons in the red
wavelengths (Figure 19.39). In contrast, the low-spin iron(II) complex K4[Fe(CN)6] appears pale yellow because it
absorbs higher-energy violet photons.

In general, strong-field ligands cause a large split in the energies of d orbitals of the central metal atom (large Δoct).
Transition metal coordination compounds with these ligands are yellow, orange, or red because they absorb higher-
energy violet or blue light. On the other hand, coordination compounds of transition metals with weak-field ligands
are often blue-green, blue, or indigo because they absorb lower-energy yellow, orange, or red light.
A coordination compound of the Cu+ ion has a d10 configuration, and all the eg orbitals are filled. To excite an electron
to a higher level, such as the 4p orbital, photons of very high energy are necessary. This energy corresponds to very
short wavelengths in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum. No visible light is absorbed, so the eye sees no change,
and the compound appears white or colorless. A solution containing [Cu(CN)2]−, for example, is colorless. On the
other hand, octahedral Cu2+ complexes have a vacancy in the eg orbitals, and electrons can be excited to this level.
The wavelength (energy) of the light absorbed corresponds to the visible part of the spectrum, and Cu2+ complexes
are almost always colored—blue, blue-green violet, or yellow (Figure 19.40). Although CFT successfully describes
many properties of coordination complexes, molecular orbital explanations (beyond the introductory scope provided
here) are required to understand fully the behavior of coordination complexes.

Summary
19.1 Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Transition Metals and Their Compounds
The transition metals are elements with partially filled d orbitals, located in the d-block of the periodic table. The
reactivity of the transition elements varies widely from very active metals such as scandium and iron to almost inert
elements, such as the platinum metals. The type of chemistry used in the isolation of the elements from their ores
depends upon the concentration of the element in its ore and the difficulty of reducing ions of the elements to the
metals. Metals that are more active are more difficult to reduce.
Transition metals exhibit chemical behavior typical of metals. For example, they oxidize in air upon heating and react
with elemental halogens to form halides. Those elements that lie above hydrogen in the activity series react with
acids, producing salts and hydrogen gas. Oxides, hydroxides, and carbonates of transition metal compounds in low
oxidation states are basic. Halides and other salts are generally stable in water, although oxygen must be excluded
in some cases. Most transition metals form a variety of stable oxidation states, allowing them to demonstrate a wide
range of chemical reactivity.
19.2 Coordination Chemistry of Transition Metals
The transition elements and main group elements can form coordination compounds, or complexes, in which a central
metal atom or ion is bonded to one or more ligands by coordinate covalent bonds. Ligands with more than one donor
atom are called polydentate ligands and form chelates. The common geometries found in complexes are tetrahedral
and square planar (both with a coordination number of four) and octahedral (with a coordination number of six).
Cis and trans configurations are possible in some octahedral and square planar complexes. In addition to these
geometrical isomers, optical isomers (molecules or ions that are mirror images but not superimposable) are possible
in certain octahedral complexes. Coordination complexes have a wide variety of uses including oxygen transport in
blood, water purification, and pharmaceutical use.
19.3 Spectroscopic and Magnetic Properties of Coordination Compounds
Crystal field theory treats interactions between the electrons on the metal and the ligands as a simple electrostatic
effect. The presence of the ligands near the metal ion changes the energies of the metal d orbitals relative to their
energies in the free ion. Both the color and the magnetic properties of a complex can be attributed to this crystal field
splitting. The magnitude of the splitting (Δoct) depends on the nature of the ligands bonded to the metal. Strong-field
ligands produce large splitting and favor low-spin complexes, in which the t2g orbitals are completely filled before
any electrons occupy the eg orbitals. Weak-field ligands favor formation of high-spin complexes. The t2g and the eg
orbitals are singly occupied before any are doubly occupied.

Introduction
All living things on earth are formed mostly of carbon compounds. The prevalence of carbon compounds in living
things has led to the epithet “carbon-based” life. The truth is we know of no other kind of life. Early chemists regarded
substances isolated from organisms (plants and animals) as a different type of matter that could not be synthesized
artificially, and these substances were thus known as organic compounds. The widespread belief called vitalism held
that organic compounds were formed by a vital force present only in living organisms. The German chemist Friedrich
Wohler was one of the early chemists to refute this aspect of vitalism, when, in 1828, he reported the synthesis of urea,
a component of many body fluids, from nonliving materials. Since then, it has been recognized that organic molecules
obey the same natural laws as inorganic substances, and the category of organic compounds has evolved to include
both natural and synthetic compounds that contain carbon. Some carbon-containing compounds are not classified as
organic, for example, carbonates and cyanides, and simple oxides, such as CO and CO2. Although a single, precise
definition has yet to be identified by the chemistry community, most agree that a defining trait of organic molecules
is the presence of carbon as the principal element, bonded to hydrogen and other carbon atoms.
Today, organic compounds are key components of plastics, soaps, perfumes, sweeteners, fabrics, pharmaceuticals, and
many other substances that we use every day. The value to us of organic compounds ensures that organic chemistry
is an important discipline within the general field of chemistry. In this chapter, we discuss why the element carbon
gives rise to a vast number and variety of compounds, how those compounds are classified, and the role of organic
compounds in representative biological and industrial settings.

20.1 Hydrocarbons
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Explain the importance of hydrocarbons and the reason for their diversity
• Name saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, and molecules derived from them
• Describe the reactions characteristic of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons
• Identify structural and geometric isomers of hydrocarbons
The largest database[1] of organic compounds lists about 10 million substances, which include compounds originating
from living organisms and those synthesized by chemists. The number of potential organic compounds has been
estimated[2] at 1060—an astronomically high number. The existence of so many organic molecules is a consequence
of the ability of carbon atoms to form up to four strong bonds to other carbon atoms, resulting in chains and rings of
many different sizes, shapes, and complexities.
The simplest organic compounds contain only the elements carbon and hydrogen, and are called hydrocarbons.
Even though they are composed of only two types of atoms, there is a wide variety of hydrocarbons because they
may consist of varying lengths of chains, branched chains, and rings of carbon atoms, or combinations of these
structures. In addition, hydrocarbons may differ in the types of carbon-carbon bonds present in their molecules.
Many hydrocarbons are found in plants, animals, and their fossils; other hydrocarbons have been prepared in the
laboratory. We use hydrocarbons every day, mainly as fuels, such as natural gas, acetylene, propane, butane, and the
principal components of gasoline, diesel fuel, and heating oil. The familiar plastics polyethylene, polypropylene, and
polystyrene are also hydrocarbons. We can distinguish several types of hydrocarbons by differences in the bonding
between carbon atoms. This leads to differences in geometries and in the hybridization of the carbon orbitals.
Alkanes
Alkanes, or saturated hydrocarbons, contain only single covalent bonds between carbon atoms. Each of the carbon
atoms in an alkane has sp3 hybrid orbitals and is bonded to four other atoms, each of which is either carbon or
hydrogen. The Lewis structures and models of methane, ethane, and pentane are illustrated in Figure 20.2. Carbon
chains are usually drawn as straight lines in Lewis structures, but one has to remember that Lewis structures are not
intended to indicate the geometry of molecules. Notice that the carbon atoms in the structural models (the ball-and-
stick and space-filling models) of the pentane molecule do not lie in a straight line. Because of the sp3 hybridization,
the bond angles in carbon chains are close to 109.5°, giving such chains in an alkane a zigzag shape.
The structures of alkanes and other organic molecules may also be represented in a less detailed manner by condensed
structural formulas (or simply, condensed formulas). Instead of the usual format for chemical formulas in which each
element symbol appears just once, a condensed formula is written to suggest the bonding in the molecule. These
formulas have the appearance of a Lewis structure from which most or all of the bond symbols have been removed.
Condensed structural formulas for ethane and pentane are shown at the bottom of Figure 20.2, and several additional
examples are provided in the exercises at the end of this chapter.

Figure 20.2 Pictured are the Lewis structures, ball-and-stick models, and space-filling models for molecules of
methane, ethane, and pentane.
A common method used by organic chemists to simplify the drawings of larger molecules is to use a skeletal
structure (also called a line-angle structure). In this type of structure, carbon atoms are not symbolized with a C, but
represented by each end of a line or bend in a line. Hydrogen atoms are not drawn if they are attached to a carbon.
Other atoms besides carbon and hydrogen are represented by their elemental symbols. Figure 20.3 shows three
different ways to draw the same structure.

Figure 20.3 The same structure can be represented three different ways: an expanded formula, a condensed
formula, and a skeletal structure.

There are eight places where lines intersect or end, meaning that there are eight carbon atoms in the

Answer: C9H20
All alkanes are composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms, and have similar bonds, structures, and formulas; noncyclic
alkanes all have a formula of CnH2n+2. The number of carbon atoms present in an alkane has no limit. Greater numbers
of atoms in the molecules will lead to stronger intermolecular attractions (dispersion forces) and correspondingly
different physical properties of the molecules. Properties such as melting point and boiling point (Table 20.1) usually
change smoothly and predictably as the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecules change.

Hydrocarbons with the same formula, including alkanes, can have different structures. For example, two alkanes
have the formula C4H10: They are called n-butane and 2-methylpropane (or isobutane), and have the following Lewis
structures:

The compounds n-butane and 2-methylpropane are structural isomers (the term constitutional isomers is also
commonly used). Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but different spatial arrangements of the
atoms in their molecules. The n-butane molecule contains an unbranched chain, meaning that no carbon atom is
bonded to more than two other carbon atoms. We use the term normal, or the prefix n, to refer to a chain of carbon
atoms without branching. The compound 2–methylpropane has a branched chain (the carbon atom in the center of the
Lewis structure is bonded to three other carbon atoms)
Identifying isomers from Lewis structures is not as easy as it looks. Lewis structures that look different may actually
represent the same isomers. For example, the three structures in Figure 20.4 all represent the same molecule,
n-butane, and hence are not different isomers. They are identical because each contains an unbranched chain of four
carbon atoms.
Figure 20.4 These three representations of the structure of n-butane are not isomers because they all contain the
same arrangement of atoms and bonds.
The Basics of Organic Nomenclature: Naming Alkanes
The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has devised a system of nomenclature that begins
with the names of the alkanes and can be adjusted from there to account for more complicated structures. The
nomenclature for alkanes is based on two rules:
1. To name an alkane, first identify the longest chain of carbon atoms in its structure. A two-carbon chain is
called ethane; a three-carbon chain, propane; and a four-carbon chain, butane. Longer chains are named as
follows: pentane (five-carbon chain), hexane (6), heptane (7), octane (8), nonane (9), and decane (10). These
prefixes can be seen in the names of the alkanes described in Table 20.1.
2. Add prefixes to the name of the longest chain to indicate the positions and names of substituents. Substituents
are branches or functional groups that replace hydrogen atoms on a chain. The position of a substituent or
branch is identified by the number of the carbon atom it is bonded to in the chain. We number the carbon
atoms in the chain by counting from the end of the chain nearest the substituents. Multiple substituents are
named individually and placed in alphabetical order at the front of the name.
Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 1083
When more than one substituent is present, either on the same carbon atom or on different carbon atoms, the
substituents are listed alphabetically. Because the carbon atom numbering begins at the end closest to a substituent,
the longest chain of carbon atoms is numbered in such a way as to produce the lowest number for the substituents. The
ending -o replaces -ide at the end of the name of an electronegative substituent (in ionic compounds, the negatively
charged ion ends with -ide like chloride; in organic compounds, such atoms are treated as substituents and the -o
ending is used). The number of substituents of the same type is indicated by the prefixes di- (two), tri- (three), tetra-
(four), and so on (for example, difluoro- indicates two fluoride substituents).
Example 20.3
Naming Halogen-substituted Alkanes
Name the molecule whose structure is shown here:
Solution
The four-carbon chain is numbered from the end with the chlorine atom. This puts the substituents on
positions 1 and 2 (numbering from the other end would put the substituents on positions 3 and 4). Four
carbon atoms means that the base name of this compound will be butane. The bromine at position 2 will
be described by adding 2-bromo-; this will come at the beginning of the name, since bromo- comes before
chloro- alphabetically. The chlorine at position 1 will be described by adding 1-chloro-, resulting in the
name of the molecule being 2-bromo-1-chlorobutane.
Check Your Learning
Name the following molecule:
Answer: 3,3-dibromo-2-iodopentane
We call a substituent that contains one less hydrogen than the corresponding alkane an alkyl group. The name of an
alkyl group is obtained by dropping the suffix -ane of the alkane name and adding -yl:
1084 Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry

The open bonds in the methyl and ethyl groups indicate that these alkyl groups are bonded to another atom.
Example 20.4
Naming Substituted Alkanes
Name the molecule whose structure is shown here:
Solution
The longest carbon chain runs horizontally across the page and contains six carbon atoms (this makes the
base of the name hexane, but we will also need to incorporate the name of the branch). In this case, we
want to number from right to left (as shown by the blue numbers) so the branch is connected to carbon 3
(imagine the numbers from left to right—this would put the branch on carbon 4, violating our rules). The
branch attached to position 3 of our chain contains two carbon atoms (numbered in red)—so we take our
name for two carbons eth- and attach -yl at the end to signify we are describing a branch. Putting all the
pieces together, this molecule is 3-ethylhexane.

Name the following molecule:
Answer: 4-propyloctane
Some hydrocarbons can form more than one type of alkyl group when the hydrogen atoms that would be removed
have different “environments” in the molecule. This diversity of possible alkyl groups can be identified in the
following way: The four hydrogen atoms in a methane molecule are equivalent; they all have the same environment.
They are equivalent because each is bonded to a carbon atom (the same carbon atom) that is bonded to three hydrogen
atoms. (It may be easier to see the equivalency in the ball and stick models in Figure 20.2. Removal of any one of the
four hydrogen atoms from methane forms a methyl group. Likewise, the six hydrogen atoms in ethane are equivalent
(Figure 20.2) and removing any one of these hydrogen atoms produces an ethyl group. Each of the six hydrogen
atoms is bonded to a carbon atom that is bonded to two other hydrogen atoms and a carbon atom. However, in both
propane and 2–methylpropane, there are hydrogen atoms in two different environments, distinguished by the adjacent
atoms or groups of atoms:
Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 1085
Each of the six equivalent hydrogen atoms of the first type in propane and each of the nine equivalent hydrogen atoms
of that type in 2-methylpropane (all shown in black) are bonded to a carbon atom that is bonded to only one other
carbon atom. The two purple hydrogen atoms in propane are of a second type. They differ from the six hydrogen
atoms of the first type in that they are bonded to a carbon atom bonded to two other carbon atoms. The green hydrogen
atom in 2-methylpropane differs from the other nine hydrogen atoms in that molecule and from the purple hydrogen
atoms in propane. The green hydrogen atom in 2-methylpropane is bonded to a carbon atom bonded to three other
carbon atoms. Two different alkyl groups can be formed from each of these molecules, depending on which hydrogen
atom is removed. The names and structures of these and several other alkyl groups are listed in Figure 20.5.
Figure 20.5 This listing gives the names and formulas for various alkyl groups formed by the removal of hydrogen
atoms from different locations.
Note that alkyl groups do not exist as stable independent entities. They are always a part of some larger molecule.
The location of an alkyl group on a hydrocarbon chain is indicated in the same way as any other substituent:

Alkanes are relatively stable molecules, but heat or light will activate reactions that involve the breaking of C–H or
C–C single bonds. Combustion is one such reaction:
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) ⟶ CO2(g) + 2H2 O(g)
Alkanes burn in the presence of oxygen, a highly exothermic oxidation-reduction reaction that produces carbon
dioxide and water. As a consequence, alkanes are excellent fuels. For example, methane, CH4, is the principal
component of natural gas. Butane, C4H10, used in camping stoves and lighters is an alkane. Gasoline is a liquid
mixture of continuous- and branched-chain alkanes, each containing from five to nine carbon atoms, plus various
additives to improve its performance as a fuel. Kerosene, diesel oil, and fuel oil are primarily mixtures of alkanes with
higher molecular masses. The main source of these liquid alkane fuels is crude oil, a complex mixture that is separated
by fractional distillation. Fractional distillation takes advantage of differences in the boiling points of the components
of the mixture (see Figure 20.6). You may recall that boiling point is a function of intermolecular interactions, which
was discussed in the chapter on solutions and colloids.
Figure 20.6 In a column for the fractional distillation of crude oil, oil heated to about 425 °C in the furnace vaporizes
when it enters the base of the tower. The vapors rise through bubble caps in a series of trays in the tower. As the
vapors gradually cool, fractions of higher, then of lower, boiling points condense to liquids and are drawn off. (credit

Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 1087
In a substitution reaction, another typical reaction of alkanes, one or more of the alkane’s hydrogen atoms is replaced
with a different atom or group of atoms. No carbon-carbon bonds are broken in these reactions, and the hybridization
of the carbon atoms does not change. For example, the reaction between ethane and molecular chlorine depicted here
is a substitution reaction:
The C–Cl portion of the chloroethane molecule is an example of a functional group, the part or moiety of a molecule
that imparts a specific chemical reactivity. The types of functional groups present in an organic molecule are major
determinants of its chemical properties and are used as a means of classifying organic compounds as detailed in the
remaining sections of this chapter.

Alkenes
Organic compounds that contain one or more double or triple bonds between carbon atoms are described as
unsaturated. You have likely heard of unsaturated fats. These are complex organic molecules with long chains of
carbon atoms, which contain at least one double bond between carbon atoms. Unsaturated hydrocarbon molecules
that contain one or more double bonds are called alkenes. Carbon atoms linked by a double bond are bound together
by two bonds, one σ bond and one π bond. Double and triple bonds give rise to a different geometry around the carbon
atom that participates in them, leading to important differences in molecular shape and properties. The differing
geometries are responsible for the different properties of unsaturated versus saturated fats.
Ethene, C2H4, is the simplest alkene. Each carbon atom in ethene, commonly called ethylene, has a trigonal planar
structure. The second member of the series is propene (propylene) (Figure 20.7); the butene isomers follow in the
series. Four carbon atoms in the chain of butene allows for the formation of isomers based on the position of the
double bond, as well as a new form of isomerism.

Figure 20.7 Expanded structures, ball-and-stick structures, and space-filling models for the alkenes ethene,
propene, and 1-butene are shown.
Ethylene (the common industrial name for ethene) is a basic raw material in the production of polyethylene and other
important compounds. Over 135 million tons of ethylene were produced worldwide in 2010 for use in the polymer,
petrochemical, and plastic industries. Ethylene is produced industrially in a process called cracking, in which the long
hydrocarbon chains in a petroleum mixture are broken into smaller molecules.
Recycling Plastics
Polymers (from Greek words poly meaning “many” and mer meaning “parts”) are large molecules made up
of repeating units, referred to as monomers. Polymers can be natural (starch is a polymer of sugar residues
and proteins are polymers of amino acids) or synthetic [like polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and
polystyrene]. The variety of structures of polymers translates into a broad range of properties and uses that
make them integral parts of our everyday lives. Adding functional groups to the structure of a polymer can
result in significantly different properties (see the discussion about Kevlar later in this chapter).
An example of a polymerization reaction is shown in Figure 20.8. The monomer ethylene (C2H4) is a gas
at room temperature, but when polymerized, using a transition metal catalyst, it is transformed into a solid
material made up of long chains of –CH2– units called polyethylene. Polyethylene is a commodity plastic used
primarily for packaging (bags and films).
Chemistry in Everyday Life
Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 1089
Figure 20.8 The reaction for the polymerization of ethylene to polyethylene is shown.
Polyethylene is a member of one subset of synthetic polymers classified as plastics. Plastics are synthetic
organic solids that can be molded; they are typically organic polymers with high molecular masses. Most
of the monomers that go into common plastics (ethylene, propylene, vinyl chloride, styrene, and ethylene
terephthalate) are derived from petrochemicals and are not very biodegradable, making them candidate
materials for recycling. Recycling plastics helps minimize the need for using more of the petrochemical supplies
and also minimizes the environmental damage caused by throwing away these nonbiodegradable materials.
Plastic recycling is the process of recovering waste, scrap, or used plastics, and reprocessing the material into
useful products. For example, polyethylene terephthalate (soft drink bottles) can be melted down and used for
plastic furniture, in carpets, or for other applications. Other plastics, like polyethylene (bags) and polypropylene
(cups, plastic food containers), can be recycled or reprocessed to be used again. Many areas of the country
have recycling programs that focus on one or more of the commodity plastics that have been assigned a
recycling code (see Figure 20.9). These operations have been in effect since the 1970s and have made the
production of some plastics among the most efficient industrial operations today.

Figure 20.9 Each type of recyclable plastic is imprinted with a code for easy identification.
The name of an alkene is derived from the name of the alkane with the same number of carbon atoms. The presence
of the double bond is signified by replacing the suffix -ane with the suffix -ene. The location of the double bond is
identified by naming the smaller of the numbers of the carbon atoms participating in the double bond:
Isomers of Alkenes
Molecules of 1-butene and 2-butene are structural isomers; the arrangement of the atoms in these two molecules
differs. As an example of arrangement differences, the first carbon atom in 1-butene is bonded to two hydrogen atoms;
the first carbon atom in 2-butene is bonded to three hydrogen atoms.
The compound 2-butene and some other alkenes also form a second type of isomer called a geometric isomer. In a set
of geometric isomers, the same types of atoms are attached to each other in the same order, but the geometries of the
two molecules differ. Geometric isomers of alkenes differ in the orientation of the groups on either side of a C = C
Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 1091
bond.
Carbon atoms are free to rotate around a single bond but not around a double bond; a double bond is rigid. This makes
it possible to have two isomers of 2-butene, one with both methyl groups on the same side of the double bond and
one with the methyl groups on opposite sides. When structures of butene are drawn with 120° bond angles around
the sp2-hybridized carbon atoms participating in the double bond, the isomers are apparent. The 2-butene isomer in
which the two methyl groups are on the same side is called a cis-isomer; the one in which the two methyl groups
are on opposite sides is called a trans-isomer (Figure 20.10). The different geometries produce different physical
properties, such as boiling point, that may make separation of the isomers possible:
Figure 20.10 These molecular models show the structural and geometric isomers of butene.
Alkenes are much more reactive than alkanes because the C = C moiety is a reactive functional group. A π bond,
being a weaker bond, is disrupted much more easily than a σ bond. Thus, alkenes undergo a characteristic reaction
in which the π bond is broken and replaced by two σ bonds. This reaction is called an addition reaction. The
hybridization of the carbon atoms in the double bond in an alkene changes from sp2 to sp3 during an addition reaction.
For example, halogens add to the double bond in an alkene instead of replacing hydrogen, as occurs in an alkane:

Alkene Reactivity and Naming
Provide the IUPAC names for the reactant and product of the halogenation reaction shown here:

Solution
The reactant is a five-carbon chain that contains a carbon-carbon double bond, so the base name will be
pentene. We begin counting at the end of the chain closest to the double bond—in this case, from the
left—the double bond spans carbons 2 and 3, so the name becomes 2-pentene. Since there are two carbon-
containing groups attached to the two carbon atoms in the double bond—and they are on the same side of
the double bond—this molecule is the cis-isomer, making the name of the starting alkene cis-2-pentene. The
product of the halogenation reaction will have two chlorine atoms attached to the carbon atoms that were a
part of the carbon-carbon double bond:
This molecule is now a substituted alkane and will be named as such. The base of the name will be pentane.
We will count from the end that numbers the carbon atoms where the chlorine atoms are attached as 2 and
3, making the name of the product 2,3-dichloropentane.

Alkynes
Hydrocarbon molecules with one or more triple bonds are called alkynes; they make up another series of unsaturated
hydrocarbons. Two carbon atoms joined by a triple bond are bound together by one σ bond and two π bonds. The
sp-hybridized carbons involved in the triple bond have bond angles of 180°, giving these types of bonds a linear, rod-
like shape.
The simplest member of the alkyne series is ethyne, C2H2, commonly called acetylene. The Lewis structure for
ethyne, a linear molecule, is:
The IUPAC nomenclature for alkynes is similar to that for alkenes except that the suffix -yne is used to indicate a
triple bond in the chain. For example, CH3 CH2 C ≡ CH is called 1-butyne.
Example 20.6
Structure of Alkynes
Describe the geometry and hybridization of the carbon atoms in the following molecule:
Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 1093
Solution
Carbon atoms 1 and 4 have four single bonds and are thus tetrahedral with sp3 hybridization. Carbon atoms
2 and 3 are involved in the triple bond, so they have linear geometries and would be classified as sp hybrids.

109.5°
Chemically, the alkynes are similar to the alkenes. Since the C ≡ C functional group has two π bonds, alkynes
typically react even more readily, and react with twice as much reagent in addition reactions. The reaction of acetylene
with bromine is a typical example:
Acetylene and the other alkynes also burn readily. An acetylene torch takes advantage of the high heat of combustion
for acetylene.
Aromatic Hydrocarbons
Benzene, C6H6, is the simplest member of a large family of hydrocarbons, called aromatic hydrocarbons. These
compounds contain ring structures and exhibit bonding that must be described using the resonance hybrid concept of
valence bond theory or the delocalization concept of molecular orbital theory. (To review these concepts, refer to the
earlier chapters on chemical bonding). The resonance structures for benzene, C6H6, are:
Valence bond theory describes the benzene molecule and other planar aromatic hydrocarbon molecules as hexagonal
rings of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms with the unhybridized p orbital of each carbon atom perpendicular to the plane
of the ring. Three valence electrons in the sp2 hybrid orbitals of each carbon atom and the valence electron of each
hydrogen atom form the framework of σ bonds in the benzene molecule. The fourth valence electron of each carbon
atom is shared with an adjacent carbon atom in their unhybridized p orbitals to yield the π bonds. Benzene does not,
however, exhibit the characteristics typical of an alkene. Each of the six bonds between its carbon atoms is equivalent
and exhibits properties that are intermediate between those of a C–C single bond and a C = C double bond. To
represent this unique bonding, structural formulas for benzene and its derivatives are typically drawn with single
bonds between the carbon atoms and a circle within the ring as shown in Figure 20.11.

Figure 20.11 This condensed formula shows the unique bonding structure of benzene.
There are many derivatives of benzene. The hydrogen atoms can be replaced by many different substituents. Aromatic
compounds more readily undergo substitution reactions than addition reactions; replacement of one of the hydrogen
atoms with another substituent will leave the delocalized double bonds intact. The following are typical examples of
substituted benzene derivatives:
Toluene and xylene are important solvents and raw materials in the chemical industry. Styrene is used to produce the
polymer polystyrene.

20.2 Alcohols and Ethers
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the structure and properties of alcohols
• Describe the structure and properties of ethers
• Name and draw structures for alcohols and ethers
In this section, we will learn about alcohols and ethers.
Alcohols
Incorporation of an oxygen atom into carbon- and hydrogen-containing molecules leads to new functional groups and
new families of compounds. When the oxygen atom is attached by single bonds, the molecule is either an alcohol or
ether.
Alcohols are derivatives of hydrocarbons in which an –OH group has replaced a hydrogen atom. Although all
alcohols have one or more hydroxyl (–OH) functional groups, they do not behave like bases such as NaOH and KOH.
NaOH and KOH are ionic compounds that contain OH– ions. Alcohols are covalent molecules; the –OH group in an
alcohol molecule is attached to a carbon atom by a covalent bond.
Ethanol, CH3CH2OH, also called ethyl alcohol, is a particularly important alcohol for human use. Ethanol is the
alcohol produced by some species of yeast that is found in wine, beer, and distilled drinks. It has long been prepared
by humans harnessing the metabolic efforts of yeasts in fermenting various sugars:
Large quantities of ethanol are synthesized from the addition reaction of water with ethylene using an acid as a
catalyst:
1096 Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Alcohols containing two or more hydroxyl groups can be made. Examples include 1,2-ethanediol (ethylene glycol,
used in antifreeze) and 1,2,3-propanetriol (glycerine, used as a solvent for cosmetics and medicines):
Naming Alcohols
The name of an alcohol comes from the hydrocarbon from which it was derived. The final -e in the name of the
hydrocarbon is replaced by -ol, and the carbon atom to which the –OH group is bonded is indicated by a number
placed before the name.[5]
Example 20.8
Naming Alcohols
Consider the following example. How should it be named?
Solution
The carbon chain contains five carbon atoms. If the hydroxyl group was not present, we would have named
this molecule pentane. To address the fact that the hydroxyl group is present, we change the ending of the
name to -ol. In this case, since the –OH is attached to carbon 2 in the chain, we would name this molecule
2-pentanol.
Check Your Learning
Name the following molecule:
Answer: 2-methyl-2-pentanol
Ethers
Ethers are compounds that contain the functional group –O–. Ethers do not have a designated suffix like the other
5. The IUPAC adopted new nomenclature guidelines in 2013 that require this number to be placed as an “infix” rather than a prefix. For
example, the new name for 2-propanol would be propan-2-ol. Widespread adoption of this new nomenclature will take some time, and
students are encouraged to be familiar with both the old and new naming protocols.
Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 1097
types of molecules we have named so far. In the IUPAC system, the oxygen atom and the smaller carbon branch
are named as an alkoxy substituent and the remainder of the molecule as the base chain, as in alkanes. As shown in
the following compound, the red symbols represent the smaller alkyl group and the oxygen atom, which would be
named “methoxy.” The larger carbon branch would be ethane, making the molecule methoxyethane. Many ethers are
referred to with common names instead of the IUPAC system names. For common names, the two branches connected
to the oxygen atom are named separately and followed by “ether.” The common name for the compound shown in
Example 20.9 is ethylmethyl ether:
Example 20.9
Naming Ethers
Provide the IUPAC and common name for the ether shown here:
Solution
IUPAC: The molecule is made up of an ethoxy group attached to an ethane chain, so the IUPAC name would
be ethoxyethane.
Common: The groups attached to the oxygen atom are both ethyl groups, so the common name would be
diethyl ether.
Check Your Learning
Provide the IUPAC and common name for the ether shown:
Answer: IUPAC: 2-methoxypropane; common: isopropylmethyl ether
Ethers can be obtained from alcohols by the elimination of a molecule of water from two molecules of the alcohol.
For example, when ethanol is treated with a limited amount of sulfuric acid and heated to 140 °C, diethyl ether and
water are formed:
In the general formula for ethers, R—O—R, the hydrocarbon groups (R) may be the same or different. Diethyl ether,
the most widely used compound of this class, is a colorless, volatile liquid that is highly flammable. It was first
used in 1846 as an anesthetic, but better anesthetics have now largely taken its place. Diethyl ether and other ethers
are presently used primarily as solvents for gums, fats, waxes, and resins. Tertiary-butyl methyl ether, C4H9OCH3
(abbreviated MTBE—italicized portions of names are not counted when ranking the groups alphabetically—so butyl
comes before methyl in the common name), is used as an additive for gasoline. MTBE belongs to a group of
chemicals known as oxygenates due to their capacity to increase the oxygen content of gasoline.

Carbohydrates and Diabetes
Carbohydrates are large biomolecules made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The dietary forms of
carbohydrates are foods rich in these types of molecules, like pastas, bread, and candy. The name
“carbohydrate” comes from the formula of the molecules, which can be described by the general formula
Cm(H2O)n, which shows that they are in a sense “carbon and water” or “hydrates of carbon.” In many
cases, m and n have the same value, but they can be different. The smaller carbohydrates are generally
referred to as “sugars,” the biochemical term for this group of molecules is “saccharide” from the Greek word
for sugar (Figure 20.12). Depending on the number of sugar units joined together, they may be classified
as monosaccharides (one sugar unit), disaccharides (two sugar units), oligosaccharides (a few sugars), or
polysaccharides (the polymeric version of sugars—polymers were described in the feature box earlier in this
chapter on recycling plastics). The scientific names of sugars can be recognized by the suffix -ose at the end of
the name (for instance, fruit sugar is a monosaccharide called “fructose” and milk sugar is a disaccharide called
lactose composed of two monosaccharides, glucose and galactose, connected together). Sugars contain
some of the functional groups we have discussed: Note the alcohol groups present in the structures and how
monosaccharide units are linked to form a disaccharide by formation of an ether.
Figure 20.12 The illustrations show the molecular structures of fructose, a five-carbon monosaccharide, and
of lactose, a disaccharide composed of two isomeric, six-carbon sugars.

Organisms use carbohydrates for a variety of functions. Carbohydrates can store energy, such as the
polysaccharides glycogen in animals or starch in plants. They also provide structural support, such as the
polysaccharide cellulose in plants and the modified polysaccharide chitin in fungi and animals. The sugars
ribose and deoxyribose are components of the backbones of RNA and DNA, respectively. Other sugars play
key roles in the function of the immune system, in cell-cell recognition, and in many other biological roles.
Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases in which a person has a high sugar concentration in their blood
(Figure 20.13). Diabetes may be caused by insufficient insulin production by the pancreas or by the body’s
cells not responding properly to the insulin that is produced. In a healthy person, insulin is produced when it is
needed and functions to transport glucose from the blood into the cells where it can be used for energy. The
long-term complications of diabetes can include loss of eyesight, heart disease, and kidney failure.
In 2013, it was estimated that approximately 3.3% of the world’s population (~380 million people) suffered from
diabetes, resulting in over a million deaths annually. Prevention involves eating a healthy diet, getting plenty
of exercise, and maintaining a normal body weight. Treatment involves all of these lifestyle practices and may
require injections of insulin.
Figure 20.13 Diabetes is a disease characterized by high concentrations of glucose in the blood. Treating
diabetes involves making lifestyle changes, monitoring blood-sugar levels, and sometimes insulin injections.

20.3 Aldehydes, Ketones, Carboxylic Acids, and Esters
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the structure and properties of aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and esters
Another class of organic molecules contains a carbon atom connected to an oxygen atom by a double bond, commonly
called a carbonyl group. The trigonal planar carbon in the carbonyl group can attach to two other substituents leading
to several subfamilies (aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and esters) described in this section.
1100 Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Aldehydes and Ketones
Both aldehydes and ketones contain a carbonyl group, a functional group with a carbon-oxygen double bond. The
names for aldehyde and ketone compounds are derived using similar nomenclature rules as for alkanes and alcohols,
and include the class-identifying suffixes -al and -one, respectively:
In an aldehyde, the carbonyl group is bonded to at least one hydrogen atom. In a ketone, the carbonyl group is bonded
to two carbon atoms:
As text, an aldehyde group is represented as –CHO; a ketone is represented as –C(O)– or –CO–.
In both aldehydes and ketones, the geometry around the carbon atom in the carbonyl group is trigonal planar; the
carbon atom exhibits sp2 hybridization. Two of the sp2 orbitals on the carbon atom in the carbonyl group are used to
form σ bonds to the other carbon or hydrogen atoms in a molecule. The remaining sp2 hybrid orbital forms a σ bond
to the oxygen atom. The unhybridized p orbital on the carbon atom in the carbonyl group overlaps a p orbital on the
oxygen atom to form the π bond in the double bond.
Like the C = O bond in carbon dioxide, the C = O bond of a carbonyl group is polar (recall that oxygen is
significantly more electronegative than carbon, and the shared electrons are pulled toward the oxygen atom and away
from the carbon atom). Many of the reactions of aldehydes and ketones start with the reaction between a Lewis base
and the carbon atom at the positive end of the polar C = O bond to yield an unstable intermediate that subsequently
undergoes one or more structural rearrangements to form the final product (Figure 20.14).
Figure 20.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal
planar.
The importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that
produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol—for organic molecules,
oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbon-oxygen bond.
The reverse reaction—replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond—is a reduction of that carbon
atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a –2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine.
Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not
have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the
overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive
Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 1101
oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This
should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of C–O and C–H bonds. The other reagents and possible
products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon
atoms:
Example 20.10
Oxidation and Reduction in Organic Chemistry
Methane represents the completely reduced form of an organic molecule that contains one carbon atom.
Sequentially replacing each of the carbon-hydrogen bonds with a carbon-oxygen bond would lead to an
alcohol, then an aldehyde, then a carboxylic acid (discussed later), and, finally, carbon dioxide:
CH4 ⟶ CH3 OH ⟶ CH2 O ⟶ HCO2 H ⟶ CO2
What are the oxidation numbers for the carbon atoms in the molecules shown here?
Solution
In this example, we can calculate the oxidation number (review the chapter on oxidation-reduction reactions
if necessary) for the carbon atom in each case (note how this would become difficult for larger molecules
with additional carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms, which is why organic chemists use the definition dealing
with replacing C–H bonds with C–O bonds described). For CH4, the carbon atom carries a –4 oxidation
number (the hydrogen atoms are assigned oxidation numbers of +1 and the carbon atom balances that
by having an oxidation number of –4). For the alcohol (in this case, methanol), the carbon atom has an
oxidation number of –2 (the oxygen atom is assigned –2, the four hydrogen atoms each are assigned +1, and
the carbon atom balances the sum by having an oxidation number of –2; note that compared to the carbon
atom in CH4, this carbon atom has lost two electrons so it was oxidized); for the aldehyde, the carbon atom’s
oxidation number is 0 (–2 for the oxygen atom and +1 for each hydrogen atom already balances to 0, so the
oxidation number for the carbon atom is 0); for the carboxylic acid, the carbon atom’s oxidation number is
+2 (two oxygen atoms each at –2 and two hydrogen atoms at +1); and for carbon dioxide, the carbon atom’s
oxidation number is +4 (here, the carbon atom needs to balance the –4 sum from the two oxygen atoms).

replaced by bonds to an oxygen atom)
Aldehydes are commonly prepared by the oxidation of alcohols whose –OH functional group is located on the carbon
atom at the end of the chain of carbon atoms in the alcohol:
Alcohols that have their –OH groups in the middle of the chain are necessary to synthesize a ketone, which requires
the carbonyl group to be bonded to two other carbon atoms:
An alcohol with its –OH group bonded to a carbon atom that is bonded to no or one other carbon atom will form an
aldehyde. An alcohol with its –OH group attached to two other carbon atoms will form a ketone. If three carbons are
attached to the carbon bonded to the –OH, the molecule will not have a C–H bond to be replaced, so it will not be
susceptible to oxidation.
Formaldehyde, an aldehyde with the formula HCHO, is a colorless gas with a pungent and irritating odor. It is sold
in an aqueous solution called formalin, which contains about 37% formaldehyde by weight. Formaldehyde causes
coagulation of proteins, so it kills bacteria (and any other living organism) and stops many of the biological processes
that cause tissue to decay. Thus, formaldehyde is used for preserving tissue specimens and embalming bodies. It is
also used to sterilize soil or other materials. Formaldehyde is used in the manufacture of Bakelite, a hard plastic
having high chemical and electrical resistance.
Dimethyl ketone, CH3COCH3, commonly called acetone, is the simplest ketone. It is made commercially by
fermenting corn or molasses, or by oxidation of 2-propanol. Acetone is a colorless liquid. Among its many uses
are as a solvent for lacquer (including fingernail polish), cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate, acetylene, plastics, and
varnishes; as a paint and varnish remover; and as a solvent in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and chemicals.
Carboxylic Acids and Esters
The odor of vinegar is caused by the presence of acetic acid, a carboxylic acid, in the vinegar. The odor of ripe bananas
and many other fruits is due to the presence of esters, compounds that can be prepared by the reaction of a carboxylic
acid with an alcohol. Because esters do not have hydrogen bonds between molecules, they have lower vapor pressures
than the alcohols and carboxylic acids from which they are derived (see Figure 20.15).
Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 1103
Figure 20.15 Esters are responsible for the odors associated with various plants and their fruits.
Both carboxylic acids and esters contain a carbonyl group with a second oxygen atom bonded to the carbon atom in
the carbonyl group by a single bond. In a carboxylic acid, the second oxygen atom also bonds to a hydrogen atom.
In an ester, the second oxygen atom bonds to another carbon atom. The names for carboxylic acids and esters include
prefixes that denote the lengths of the carbon chains in the molecules and are derived following nomenclature rules
similar to those for inorganic acids and salts (see these examples):
The functional groups for an acid and for an ester are shown in red in these formulas.
The hydrogen atom in the functional group of a carboxylic acid will react with a base to form an ionic salt:
Carboxylic acids are weak acids (see the chapter on acids and bases), meaning they are not 100% ionized in water.
Generally only about 1% of the molecules of a carboxylic acid dissolved in water are ionized at any given time. The
remaining molecules are undissociated in solution.
1104 Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry

We prepare carboxylic acids by the oxidation of aldehydes or alcohols whose –OH functional group is located on the
carbon atom at the end of the chain of carbon atoms in the alcohol:
Esters are produced by the reaction of acids with alcohols. For example, the ester ethyl acetate, CH3CO2CH2CH3, is
formed when acetic acid reacts with ethanol:
The simplest carboxylic acid is formic acid, HCO2H, known since 1670. Its name comes from the Latin word
formicus, which means “ant”; it was first isolated by the distillation of red ants. It is partially responsible for the pain
and irritation of ant and wasp stings, and is responsible for a characteristic odor of ants that can be sometimes detected
in their nests.
Acetic acid, CH3CO2H, constitutes 3–6% vinegar. Cider vinegar is produced by allowing apple juice to ferment
without oxygen present. Yeast cells present in the juice carry out the fermentation reactions. The fermentation
reactions change the sugar present in the juice to ethanol, then to acetic acid. Pure acetic acid has a penetrating odor
and produces painful burns. It is an excellent solvent for many organic and some inorganic compounds, and it is
essential in the production of cellulose acetate, a component of many synthetic fibers such as rayon.
The distinctive and attractive odors and flavors of many flowers, perfumes, and ripe fruits are due to the presence
of one or more esters (Figure 20.16). Among the most important of the natural esters are fats (such as lard, tallow,
and butter) and oils (such as linseed, cottonseed, and olive oils), which are esters of the trihydroxyl alcohol glycerine,
C3H5(OH)3, with large carboxylic acids, such as palmitic acid, CH3(CH2)14CO2H, stearic acid, CH3(CH2)16CO2H,
and oleic acid, CH3(CH2)7 CH = CH(CH2)7 CO2 H. Oleic acid is an unsaturated acid; it contains a C = C double
bond. Palmitic and stearic acids are saturated acids that contain no double or triple bonds.

20.4 Amines and Amides
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the structure and properties of an amine
• Describe the structure and properties of an amide
Amines are molecules that contain carbon-nitrogen bonds. The nitrogen atom in an amine has a lone pair of electrons
and three bonds to other atoms, either carbon or hydrogen. Various nomenclatures are used to derive names for
amines, but all involve the class-identifying suffix –ine as illustrated here for a few simple examples:
In some amines, the nitrogen atom replaces a carbon atom in an aromatic hydrocarbon. Pyridine (Figure 20.17) is
one such heterocyclic amine. A heterocyclic compound contains atoms of two or more different elements in its ring
structure.
Figure 20.17 The illustration shows one of the resonance structures of pyridine.
DNA in Forensics and Paternity
The genetic material for all living things is a polymer of four different molecules, which are themselves a
combination of three subunits. The genetic information, the code for developing an organism, is contained in
the specific sequence of the four molecules, similar to the way the letters of the alphabet can be sequenced
to form words that convey information. The information in a DNA sequence is used to form two other types of
polymers, one of which are proteins. The proteins interact to form a specific type of organism with individual
characteristics.
A genetic molecule is called DNA, which stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. The four molecules that make
up DNA are called nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a single- or double-ringed molecule containing
nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen called a nitrogenous base. Each base is bonded to a five-carbon sugar
called deoxyribose. The sugar is in turn bonded to a phosphate group (−PO4 3−) When new DNA is made,
a polymerization reaction occurs that binds the phosphate group of one nucleotide to the sugar group of a
second nucleotide. The nitrogenous bases of each nucleotide stick out from this sugar-phosphate backbone.
DNA is actually formed from two such polymers coiled around each other and held together by hydrogen bonds
between the nitrogenous bases. Thus, the two backbones are on the outside of the coiled pair of strands, and
the bases are on the inside. The shape of the two strands wound around each other is called a double helix
(see Figure 20.18).
It probably makes sense that the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA of a cat differs from those of a dog. But

it is also true that the sequences of the DNA in the cells of two individual pugs differ. Likewise, the sequences
of DNA in you and a sibling differ (unless your sibling is an identical twin), as do those between you and
an unrelated individual. However, the DNA sequences of two related individuals are more similar than the
sequences of two unrelated individuals, and these similarities in sequence can be observed in various ways.
This is the principle behind DNA fingerprinting, which is a method used to determine whether two DNA samples
came from related (or the same) individuals or unrelated individuals.
Figure 20.18 DNA is an organic molecule and the genetic material for all living organisms. (a) DNA is a
double helix consisting of two single DNA strands hydrogen bonded together at each nitrogenous base. (b)
This detail shows the hydrogen bonding (dotted lines) between nitrogenous bases on each DNA strand and
the way in which each nucleotide is joined to the next, forming a backbone of sugars and phosphate groups
along each strand. (c) This detail shows the structure of one of the four nucleotides that makes up the DNA
polymer. Each nucleotide consists of a nitrogenous base (a double-ring molecule, in this case), a five-carbon
sugar (deoxyribose), and a phosphate group.

contains DNA that matches exactly the DNA of a suspect.

Like ammonia, amines are weak bases due to the lone pair of electrons on their nitrogen atoms:
The basicity of an amine’s nitrogen atom plays an important role in much of the compound’s chemistry. Amine
functional groups are found in a wide variety of compounds, including natural and synthetic dyes, polymers, vitamins,
and medications such as penicillin and codeine. They are also found in many molecules essential to life, such as amino
acids, hormones, neurotransmitters, and DNA.
Addictive Alkaloids
Since ancient times, plants have been used for medicinal purposes. One class of substances, called alkaloids,
found in many of these plants has been isolated and found to contain cyclic molecules with an amine functional
group. These amines are bases. They can react with H3O+ in a dilute acid to form an ammonium salt, and this
property is used to extract them from the plant:
R3 N + H3 O+ + Cl− ⟶ ⎡
⎣R3 NH+ ⎤
⎦ Cl− + H2 O
The name alkaloid means “like an alkali.” Thus, an alkaloid reacts with acid. The free compound can be
recovered after extraction by reaction with a base:

The structures of many naturally occurring alkaloids have profound physiological and psychotropic effects in
humans. Examples of these drugs include nicotine, morphine, codeine, and heroin. The plant produces these
substances, collectively called secondary plant compounds, as chemical defenses against the numerous pests
that attempt to feed on the plant:
In these diagrams, as is common in representing structures of large organic compounds, carbon atoms in the
rings and the hydrogen atoms bonded to them have been omitted for clarity. The solid wedges indicate bonds
that extend out of the page. The dashed wedges indicate bonds that extend into the page. Notice that small
changes to a part of the molecule change the properties of morphine, codeine, and heroin. Morphine, a strong
narcotic used to relieve pain, contains two hydroxyl functional groups, located at the bottom of the molecule
in this structural formula. Changing one of these hydroxyl groups to a methyl ether group forms codeine, a
less potent drug used as a local anesthetic. If both hydroxyl groups are converted to esters of acetic acid, the
powerfully addictive drug heroin results (Figure 20.19).

Amides are molecules that contain nitrogen atoms connected to the carbon atom of a carbonyl group. Like amines,
various nomenclature rules may be used to name amides, but all include use of the class-specific suffix -amide:
Amides can be produced when carboxylic acids react with amines or ammonia in a process called amidation. A water
molecule is eliminated from the reaction, and the amide is formed from the remaining pieces of the carboxylic acid
and the amine (note the similarity to formation of an ester from a carboxylic acid and an alcohol discussed in the
previous section):
The reaction between amines and carboxylic acids to form amides is biologically important. It is through this reaction
that amino acids (molecules containing both amine and carboxylic acid substituents) link together in a polymer to
form proteins.

Proteins and Enzymes
Proteins are large biological molecules made up of long chains of smaller molecules called amino acids.
Organisms rely on proteins for a variety of functions—proteins transport molecules across cell membranes,
replicate DNA, and catalyze metabolic reactions, to name only a few of their functions. The properties of
proteins are functions of the combination of amino acids that compose them and can vary greatly. Interactions
between amino acid sequences in the chains of proteins result in the folding of the chain into specific, three-
dimensional structures that determine the protein’s activity.
Amino acids are organic molecules that contain an amine functional group (–NH2), a carboxylic acid functional
group (–COOH), and a side chain (that is specific to each individual amino acid). Most living things build
proteins from the same 20 different amino acids. Amino acids connect by the formation of a peptide bond,
which is a covalent bond formed between two amino acids when the carboxylic acid group of one amino acid
reacts with the amine group of the other amino acid. The formation of the bond results in the production of
a molecule of water (in general, reactions that result in the production of water when two other molecules
combine are referred to as condensation reactions). The resulting bond—between the carbonyl group carbon
atom and the amine nitrogen atom is called a peptide link or peptide bond. Since each of the original amino
acids has an unreacted group (one has an unreacted amine and the other an unreacted carboxylic acid), more
peptide bonds can form to other amino acids, extending the structure. (Figure 20.20) A chain of connected
amino acids is called a polypeptide. Proteins contain at least one long polypeptide chain.
Figure 20.20 This condensation reaction forms a dipeptide from two amino acids and leads to the formation
of water.
Enzymes are large biological molecules, mostly composed of proteins, which are responsible for the thousands
of metabolic processes that occur in living organisms. Enzymes are highly specific catalysts; they speed up
the rates of certain reactions. Enzymes function by lowering the activation energy of the reaction they are
catalyzing, which can dramatically increase the rate of the reaction. Most reactions catalyzed by enzymes
have rates that are millions of times faster than the noncatalyzed version. Like all catalysts, enzymes are not
consumed during the reactions that they catalyze. Enzymes do differ from other catalysts in how specific they
are for their substrates (the molecules that an enzyme will convert into a different product). Each enzyme is
only capable of speeding up one or a few very specific reactions or types of reactions. Since the function of
How Sciences Interconnect
Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 1111
enzymes is so specific, the lack or malfunctioning of an enzyme can lead to serious health consequences.
One disease that is the result of an enzyme malfunction is phenylketonuria. In this disease, the enzyme that
catalyzes the first step in the degradation of the amino acid phenylalanine is not functional (Figure 20.21).
Untreated, this can lead to an accumulation of phenylalanine, which can lead to intellectual disabilities.
Figure 20.21 A computer rendering shows the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme phenylalanine
hydroxylase. In the disease phenylketonuria, a defect in the shape of phenylalanine hydroxylase causes it to
lose its function in breaking down phenylalanine.
Kevlar
Kevlar (Figure 20.22) is a synthetic polymer made from two monomers 1,4-phenylene-diamine and
terephthaloyl chloride (Kevlar is a registered trademark of DuPont). Kevlar’s first commercial use was as a
replacement for steel in racing tires. Kevlar is typically spun into ropes or fibers. The material has a high tensile
strength-to-weight ratio (it is about 5 times stronger than an equal weight of steel), making it useful for many
applications from bicycle tires to sails to body armor.

Figure 20.22 This illustration shows the formula for polymeric Kevlar.
The material owes much of its strength to hydrogen bonds between polymer chains (refer back to the chapter
on intermolecular interactions). These bonds form between the carbonyl group oxygen atom (which has a
partial negative charge due to oxygen’s electronegativity) on one monomer and the partially positively charged
hydrogen atom in the N–H bond of an adjacent monomer in the polymer structure (see dashed line in Figure
20.23). There is additional strength derived from the interaction between the unhybridized p orbitals in the six-
membered rings, called aromatic stacking.
Figure 20.23 The diagram shows the polymer structure of Kevlar, with hydrogen bonds between polymer
chains represented by dotted lines.
Kevlar may be best known as a component of body armor, combat helmets, and face masks. Since the
1980s, the US military has used Kevlar as a component of the PASGT (personal armor system for ground
troops) helmet and vest. Kevlar is also used to protect armored fighting vehicles and aircraft carriers. Civilian
applications include protective gear for emergency service personnel such as body armor for police officers
and heat-resistant clothing for fire fighters. Kevlar based clothing is considerably lighter and thinner than
Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry 1113
equivalent gear made from other materials (Figure 20.24).
Figure 20.24 (a) These soldiers are sorting through pieces of a Kevlar helmet that helped absorb a grenade
blast. Kevlar is also used to make (b) canoes and (c) marine mooring lines. (credit a: modification of work by
“Cla68”/Wikimedia Commons; credit b: modification of work by “OakleyOriginals”/Flickr; credit c: modification
of work by Casey H. Kyhl)
In addition to its better-known uses, Kevlar is also often used in cryogenics for its very low thermal conductivity
(along with its high strength). Kevlar maintains its high strength when cooled to the temperature of liquid
nitrogen (–196 °C).

Summary
20.1 Hydrocarbons
Strong, stable bonds between carbon atoms produce complex molecules containing chains, branches, and rings. The
chemistry of these compounds is called organic chemistry. Hydrocarbons are organic compounds composed of only
1116 Chapter 20 | Organic Chemistry
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
carbon and hydrogen. The alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons—that is, hydrocarbons that contain only single bonds.
Alkenes contain one or more carbon-carbon double bonds. Alkynes contain one or more carbon-carbon triple bonds.
Aromatic hydrocarbons contain ring structures with delocalized π electron systems.
20.2 Alcohols and Ethers
Many organic compounds that are not hydrocarbons can be thought of as derivatives of hydrocarbons. A hydrocarbon
derivative can be formed by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon by a functional group, which
contains at least one atom of an element other than carbon or hydrogen. The properties of hydrocarbon derivatives
are determined largely by the functional group. The –OH group is the functional group of an alcohol. The –R–O–R–
group is the functional group of an ether.
20.3 Aldehydes, Ketones, Carboxylic Acids, and Esters
Functional groups related to the carbonyl group include the –CHO group of an aldehyde, the –CO– group of a ketone,
the –CO2H group of a carboxylic acid, and the –CO2R group of an ester. The carbonyl group, a carbon-oxygen
double bond, is the key structure in these classes of organic molecules: Aldehydes contain at least one hydrogen
atom attached to the carbonyl carbon atom, ketones contain two carbon groups attached to the carbonyl carbon atom,
carboxylic acids contain a hydroxyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon atom, and esters contain an oxygen atom
attached to another carbon group connected to the carbonyl carbon atom. All of these compounds contain oxidized
carbon atoms relative to the carbon atom of an alcohol group.
20.4 Amines and Amides
The addition of nitrogen into an organic framework leads to two families of molecules. Compounds containing a
nitrogen atom bonded in a hydrocarbon framework are classified as amines. Compounds that have a nitrogen atom
bonded to one side of a carbonyl group are classified as amides. Amines are a basic functional group. Amines and
carboxylic acids can combine in a condensation reaction to form amides.

Introduction
The chemical reactions that we have considered in previous chapters involve changes in the electronic structure of
the species involved, that is, the arrangement of the electrons around atoms, ions, or molecules. Nuclear structure,
the numbers of protons and neutrons within the nuclei of the atoms involved, remains unchanged during chemical
reactions.
This chapter will introduce the topic of nuclear chemistry, which began with the discovery of radioactivity in 1896
by French physicist Antoine Becquerel and has become increasingly important during the twentieth and twenty-first
centuries, providing the basis for various technologies related to energy, medicine, geology, and many other areas.
Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1127
21.1 Nuclear Structure and Stability
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe nuclear structure in terms of protons, neutrons, and electrons
• Calculate mass defect and binding energy for nuclei
• Explain trends in the relative stability of nuclei
Nuclear chemistry is the study of reactions that involve changes in nuclear structure. The chapter on atoms,
molecules, and ions introduced the basic idea of nuclear structure, that the nucleus of an atom is composed of protons
and, with the exception of 1
1 H, neutrons. Recall that the number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic
number (Z) of the element, and the sum of the number of protons and the number of neutrons is the mass number (A).
Atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers are isotopes of the same element. When referring to
a single type of nucleus, we often use the term nuclide and identify it by the notation Z
A X, where X is the symbol
for the element, A is the mass number, and Z is the atomic number (for example, 6
14 C⎞
⎠. Often a nuclide is referenced
by the name of the element followed by a hyphen and the mass number. For example, 6
14 C is called “carbon-14.”
Protons and neutrons, collectively called nucleons, are packed together tightly in a nucleus. With a radius of about
10−15 meters, a nucleus is quite small compared to the radius of the entire atom, which is about 10−10 meters. Nuclei
are extremely dense compared to bulk matter, averaging 1.8 × 1014 grams per cubic centimeter. For example, water
has a density of 1 gram per cubic centimeter, and iridium, one of the densest elements known, has a density of 22.6
g/cm3. If the earth’s density were equal to the average nuclear density, the earth’s radius would be only about 200
meters (earth’s actual radius is approximately 6.4 × 106 meters, 30,000 times larger). Example 21.1 demonstrates
just how great nuclear densities can be in the natural world.
Example 21.1
Density of a Neutron Star
Neutron stars form when the core of a very massive star undergoes gravitational collapse, causing the star’s
outer layers to explode in a supernova. Composed almost completely of neutrons, they are the densest-
known stars in the universe, with densities comparable to the average density of an atomic nucleus. A
neutron star in a faraway galaxy has a mass equal to 2.4 solar masses (1 solar mass = M☉ = mass of the
sun = 1.99 × 1030 kg) and a diameter of 26 km.
(a) What is the density of this neutron star?
(b) How does this neutron star’s density compare to the density of a uranium nucleus, which has a diameter
of about 15 fm (1 fm = 10–15 m)?
Solution
We can treat both the neutron star and the U-235 nucleus as spheres. Then the density for both is given by:
d = m
V with V = 4
3πr3
(a) The radius of the neutron star is 1
2 × 26 km = 1
2 × 2.6 × 104 m = 1.3 × 104 m, so the density of the
neutron star is:

(b) The radius of the U-235 nucleus is 1

nucleus is:

These values are fairly similar (same order of magnitude), but the nucleus is more than twice as dense as
the neutron star.
Check Your Learning
Find the density of a neutron star with a mass of 1.97 solar masses and a diameter of 13 km, and compare it
to the density of a hydrogen nucleus, which has a diameter of 1.75 fm (1 fm = 1 × 10–15 m).
Answer: The density of the neutron star is 3.4 × 1018 kg/m3. The density of a hydrogen nucleus is 6.0 ×
1017 kg/m3. The neutron star is 5.7 times denser than the hydrogen nucleus.
To hold positively charged protons together in the very small volume of a nucleus requires very strong attractive
forces because the positively charged protons repel one another strongly at such short distances. The force of
attraction that holds the nucleus together is the strong nuclear force. (The strong force is one of the four fundamental
forces that are known to exist. The others are the electromagnetic force, the gravitational force, and the nuclear weak
force.) This force acts between protons, between neutrons, and between protons and neutrons. It is very different
from the electrostatic force that holds negatively charged electrons around a positively charged nucleus (the attraction
between opposite charges). Over distances less than 10−15 meters and within the nucleus, the strong nuclear force
is much stronger than electrostatic repulsions between protons; over larger distances and outside the nucleus, it is
essentially nonexistent.

fundamental forces.

As a simple example of the energy associated with the strong nuclear force, consider the helium atom composed of
two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons. The total mass of these six subatomic particles may be calculated as:
(2 × 1.0073 amu) + (2 × 1.0087 amu) + (2 × 0.00055 amu) = 4.0331 amu
protons neutrons electrons
However, mass spectrometric measurements reveal that the mass of an 2
4 He atom is 4.0026 amu, less than the
combined masses of its six constituent subatomic particles. This difference between the calculated and experimentally
measured masses is known as the mass defect of the atom. In the case of helium, the mass defect indicates a “loss”
in mass of 4.0331 amu – 4.0026 amu = 0.0305 amu. The loss in mass accompanying the formation of an atom
from protons, neutrons, and electrons is due to the conversion of that mass into energy that is evolved as the atom
forms. The nuclear binding energy is the energy produced when the atoms’ nucleons are bound together; this is
also the energy needed to break a nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons. In comparison to chemical bond

energies, nuclear binding energies are vastly greater, as we will learn in this section. Consequently, the energy changes
associated with nuclear reactions are vastly greater than are those for chemical reactions.
The conversion between mass and energy is most identifiably represented by the mass-energy equivalence equation
as stated by Albert Einstein:
E = mc2
where E is energy, m is mass of the matter being converted, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum. This equation
can be used to find the amount of energy that results when matter is converted into energy. Using this mass-energy
equivalence equation, the nuclear binding energy of a nucleus may be calculated from its mass defect, as demonstrated
in Example 21.2. A variety of units are commonly used for nuclear binding energies, including electron volts (eV),
with 1 eV equaling the amount of energy necessary to the move the charge of an electron across an electric potential
difference of 1 volt, making 1 eV = 1.602 × 10–19 J.
Example 21.2
Calculation of Nuclear Binding Energy
Determine the binding energy for the nuclide 2
4 He in:
(a) joules per mole of nuclei
(b) joules per nucleus
(c) MeV per nucleus
Solution
The mass defect for a 2
4 He nucleus is 0.0305 amu, as shown previously. Determine the binding energy in
joules per nuclide using the mass-energy equivalence equation. To accommodate the requested energy units,
the mass defect must be expressed in kilograms (recall that 1 J = 1 kg m2/s2).
(a) First, express the mass defect in g/mol. This is easily done considering the numerical equivalence of
atomic mass (amu) and molar mass (g/mol) that results from the definitions of the amu and mole units
(refer to the previous discussion in the chapter on atoms, molecules, and ions if needed). The mass defect is
therefore 0.0305 g/mol. To accommodate the units of the other terms in the mass-energy equation, the mass
must be expressed in kg, since 1 J = 1 kg m2/s2. Converting grams into kilograms yields a mass defect of
3.05 × 10–5 kg/mol. Substituting this quantity into the mass-energy equivalence equation yields:
E = mc2 = 3.05 × 10−5 kg
mol × ⎛
⎝2.998 × 108 m
s ⎞
⎠
2
= 2.74 × 1012 kg m2 s−2 mol−1
= 2.74 × 1012 J mol−1 = 2.74 TJ mol−1
Note that this tremendous amount of energy is associated with the conversion of a very small amount of
matter (about 30 mg, roughly the mass of typical drop of water).
(b) The binding energy for a single nucleus is computed from the molar binding energy using Avogadro’s
number:
E = 2.74 × 1012 J mol−1 × 1 mol
6.022 × 1023 nuclei = 4.55 × 10−12 J = 4.55 pJ
(c) Recall that 1 eV = 1.602 × 10–19 J. Using the binding energy computed in part (b):
E = 4.55 × 10−12 J × 1 eV
1.602 × 10−19 J = 2.84 × 107 eV = 28.4 MeV

What is the binding energy for the nuclide 9
19 F (atomic mass: 18.9984 amu) in MeV per nucleus?
Answer: 148.4 MeV
Because the energy changes for breaking and forming bonds are so small compared to the energy changes for breaking
or forming nuclei, the changes in mass during all ordinary chemical reactions are virtually undetectable. As described
in the chapter on thermochemistry, the most energetic chemical reactions exhibit enthalpies on the order of thousands
of kJ/mol, which is equivalent to mass differences in the nanogram range (10–9 g). On the other hand, nuclear binding
energies are typically on the order of billions of kJ/mol, corresponding to mass differences in the milligram range
(10–3 g).
Nuclear Stability
A nucleus is stable if it cannot be transformed into another configuration without adding energy from the outside.
Of the thousands of nuclides that exist, about 250 are stable. A plot of the number of neutrons versus the number of
protons for stable nuclei reveals that the stable isotopes fall into a narrow band. This region is known as the band
of stability (also called the belt, zone, or valley of stability). The straight line in Figure 21.2 represents nuclei
that have a 1:1 ratio of protons to neutrons (n:p ratio). Note that the lighter stable nuclei, in general, have equal
numbers of protons and neutrons. For example, nitrogen-14 has seven protons and seven neutrons. Heavier stable
nuclei, however, have increasingly more neutrons than protons. For example: iron-56 has 30 neutrons and 26 protons,
an n:p ratio of 1.15, whereas the stable nuclide lead-207 has 125 neutrons and 82 protons, an n:p ratio equal to 1.52.
This is because larger nuclei have more proton-proton repulsions, and require larger numbers of neutrons to provide
compensating strong forces to overcome these electrostatic repulsions and hold the nucleus together.
Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1131
Figure 21.2 This plot shows the nuclides that are known to exist and those that are stable. The stable nuclides are
indicated in blue, and the unstable nuclides are indicated in green. Note that all isotopes of elements with atomic
numbers greater than 83 are unstable. The solid line is the line where n = Z.
The nuclei that are to the left or to the right of the band of stability are unstable and exhibit radioactivity. They
change spontaneously (decay) into other nuclei that are either in, or closer to, the band of stability. These nuclear
decay reactions convert one unstable isotope (or radioisotope) into another, more stable, isotope. We will discuss the
nature and products of this radioactive decay in subsequent sections of this chapter.
Several observations may be made regarding the relationship between the stability of a nucleus and its structure.
Nuclei with even numbers of protons, neutrons, or both are more likely to be stable (see Table 21.1). Nuclei with
1132 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry

certain numbers of nucleons, known as magic numbers, are stable against nuclear decay. These numbers of protons
or neutrons (2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126) make complete shells in the nucleus. These are similar in concept to the
stable electron shells observed for the noble gases. Nuclei that have magic numbers of both protons and neutrons,
such as 2
4 He, 8
16 O, 20
40 Ca, and 82
208 Pb, are called “double magic” and are particularly stable. These trends in
nuclear stability may be rationalized by considering a quantum mechanical model of nuclear energy states analogous
to that used to describe electronic states earlier in this textbook. The details of this model are beyond the scope of this
chapter.

Table 21.1
The relative stability of a nucleus is correlated with its binding energy per nucleon, the total binding energy for the
nucleus divided by the number or nucleons in the nucleus. For instance, we saw in Example 21.2 that the binding
energy for a 2
4 He nucleus is 28.4 MeV. The binding energy per nucleon for a 2
4 He nucleus is therefore:
28.4 MeV
4 nucleons = 7.10 MeV/nucleon
In Example 21.3, we learn how to calculate the binding energy per nucleon of a nuclide on the curve shown in
Figure 21.3.
Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1133
Figure 21.3 The binding energy per nucleon is largest for nuclides with mass number of approximately 56.
Example 21.3
Calculation of Binding Energy per Nucleon
The iron nuclide 26
56 Fe lies near the top of the binding energy curve (Figure 21.3) and is one of the most
stable nuclides. What is the binding energy per nucleon (in MeV) for the nuclide 26
56 Fe (atomic mass of
55.9349 amu)?
Solution
As in Example 21.2, we first determine the mass defect of the nuclide, which is the difference between
the mass of 26 protons, 30 neutrons, and 26 electrons, and the observed mass of an 26
56 Fe atom:
Mass defect = ⎡
⎣(26 × 1.0073 amu) + (30 ×1.0087 amu) + (26 × 0.00055 amu)⎤
⎦ − 55.9349 amu
= 56.4651 amu − 55.9349 amu
= 0.5302 amu
We next calculate the binding energy for one nucleus from the mass defect using the mass-energy
equivalence equation:
E = mc2 = 0.5302 amu × 1.6605 × 10−27 kg
1 amu × ⎛
⎝2.998 × 108 m/s⎞
⎠
2
= 7.913 × 10−11 kg⋅m/s2
= 7.913 × 10−11 J
We then convert the binding energy in joules per nucleus into units of MeV per nuclide:
1134 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
7.913 × 10−11 J × 1 MeV
1.602 × 10−13 J = 493.9 MeV
Finally, we determine the binding energy per nucleon by dividing the total nuclear binding energy by the
number of nucleons in the atom:
Binding energy per nucleon = 493.9 MeV
56 = 8.820 MeV/nucleon
Note that this is almost 25% larger than the binding energy per nucleon for 2
4 He.
(Note also that this is the same process as in Example 21.1, but with the additional step of dividing the
total nuclear binding energy by the number of nucleons.)

21.2 Nuclear Equations
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Identify common particles and energies involved in nuclear reactions
• Write and balance nuclear equations
Changes of nuclei that result in changes in their atomic numbers, mass numbers, or energy states are nuclear
reactions. To describe a nuclear reaction, we use an equation that identifies the nuclides involved in the reaction, their
mass numbers and atomic numbers, and the other particles involved in the reaction.
Types of Particles in Nuclear Reactions
Many entities can be involved in nuclear reactions. The most common are protons, neutrons, alpha particles, beta
particles, positrons, and gamma rays, as shown in Figure 21.4. Protons ⎛
⎝1
1 p, also represented by the symbol
1
1 H⎞
⎠ and neutrons ⎛
⎝0
1 n⎞
⎠ are the constituents of atomic nuclei, and have been described previously. Alpha particles
⎛
⎝2
4 He, also represented by the symbol 2
4 α⎞
⎠ are high-energy helium nuclei. Beta particles ⎛
⎝−1
0 β, also represented
by the symbol −1
0 e⎞
⎠ are high-energy electrons, and gamma rays are photons of very high-energy electromagnetic
radiation. Positrons ⎛
⎝+1
0 e, also represented by the symbol +1
0 β⎞
⎠ are positively charged electrons (“anti-electrons”).
The subscripts and superscripts are necessary for balancing nuclear equations, but are usually optional in other
circumstances. For example, an alpha particle is a helium nucleus (He) with a charge of +2 and a mass number of 4,
so it is symbolized 2
4 He. This works because, in general, the ion charge is not important in the balancing of nuclear
equations.
Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1135
Figure 21.4 Although many species are encountered in nuclear reactions, this table summarizes the names,
symbols, representations, and descriptions of the most common of these.
Note that positrons are exactly like electrons, except they have the opposite charge. They are the most common
example of antimatter, particles with the same mass but the opposite state of another property (for example, charge)
than ordinary matter. When antimatter encounters ordinary matter, both are annihilated and their mass is converted
into energy in the form of gamma rays (γ)—and other much smaller subnuclear particles, which are beyond the
scope of this chapter—according to the mass-energy equivalence equation E = mc2, seen in the preceding section. For
example, when a positron and an electron collide, both are annihilated and two gamma ray photons are created:
−1
0 e + +1
0 e ⟶ γ + γ
As seen in the chapter discussing light and electromagnetic radiation, gamma rays compose short wavelength, high-
energy electromagnetic radiation and are (much) more energetic than better-known X-rays that can behave as particles
in the wave-particle duality sense. Gamma rays are a type of high energy electromagnetic radiation produced when
a nucleus undergoes a transition from a higher to a lower energy state, similar to how a photon is produced by an
electronic transition from a higher to a lower energy level. Due to the much larger energy differences between nuclear
energy shells, gamma rays emanating from a nucleus have energies that are typically millions of times larger than
electromagnetic radiation emanating from electronic transitions.
Balancing Nuclear Reactions
A balanced chemical reaction equation reflects the fact that during a chemical reaction, bonds break and form, and
atoms are rearranged, but the total numbers of atoms of each element are conserved and do not change. A balanced
nuclear reaction equation indicates that there is a rearrangement during a nuclear reaction, but of nucleons (subatomic
particles within the atoms’ nuclei) rather than atoms. Nuclear reactions also follow conservation laws, and they are
balanced in two ways:
1. The sum of the mass numbers of the reactants equals the sum of the mass numbers of the products.
2. The sum of the charges of the reactants equals the sum of the charges of the products.
If the atomic number and the mass number of all but one of the particles in a nuclear reaction are known, we can
1136 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry

identify the particle by balancing the reaction. For instance, we could determine that 8
17 O is a product of the nuclear
reaction of 7
14 N and 2
4 He if we knew that a proton, 1
1 H, was one of the two products. Example 21.4 shows how
we can identify a nuclide by balancing the nuclear reaction.
Example 21.4
Balancing Equations for Nuclear Reactions
The reaction of an α particle with magnesium-25 (12
25 Mg) produces a proton and a nuclide of another
element. Identify the new nuclide produced.
Solution
The nuclear reaction can be written as:
12
25 Mg + 2
4 He ⟶ 1
1 H + Z
A X
where A is the mass number and Z is the atomic number of the new nuclide, X. Because the sum of the mass
numbers of the reactants must equal the sum of the mass numbers of the products:
25 + 4 = A + 1, or A = 28
Similarly, the charges must balance, so:
12 + 2 = Z + 1, and Z = 13
Check the periodic table: The element with nuclear charge = +13 is aluminum. Thus, the product is 13
28 Al.

21.3 Radioactive Decay
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Recognize common modes of radioactive decay
• Identify common particles and energies involved in nuclear decay reactions
• Write and balance nuclear decay equations
• Calculate kinetic parameters for decay processes, including half-life
• Describe common radiometric dating techniques
Following the somewhat serendipitous discovery of radioactivity by Becquerel, many prominent scientists began to
investigate this new, intriguing phenomenon. Among them were Marie Curie (the first woman to win a Nobel Prize,
and the only person to win two Nobel Prizes in different sciences—chemistry and physics), who was the first to coin
the term “radioactivity,” and Ernest Rutherford (of gold foil experiment fame), who investigated and named three
of the most common types of radiation. During the beginning of the twentieth century, many radioactive substances
were discovered, the properties of radiation were investigated and quantified, and a solid understanding of radiation
and nuclear decay was developed.
The spontaneous change of an unstable nuclide into another is radioactive decay. The unstable nuclide is called the
parent nuclide; the nuclide that results from the decay is known as the daughter nuclide. The daughter nuclide may
be stable, or it may decay itself. The radiation produced during radioactive decay is such that the daughter nuclide
lies closer to the band of stability than the parent nuclide, so the location of a nuclide relative to the band of stability
can serve as a guide to the kind of decay it will undergo (Figure 21.5).
Figure 21.5 A nucleus of uranium-238 (the parent nuclide) undergoes α decay to form thorium-234 (the daughter
nuclide). The alpha particle removes two protons (green) and two neutrons (gray) from the uranium-238 nucleus.
Although the radioactive decay of a nucleus is too small to see with the naked eye, we can indirectly view
radioactive decay in an environment called a cloud chamber. Click here (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/

from the Jefferson Lab.
Types of Radioactive Decay
Ernest Rutherford’s experiments involving the interaction of radiation with a magnetic or electric field (Figure 21.6)

helped him determine that one type of radiation consisted of positively charged and relatively massive α particles;
a second type was made up of negatively charged and much less massive β particles; and a third was uncharged
electromagnetic waves, γ rays. We now know that α particles are high-energy helium nuclei, β particles are high-
energy electrons, and γ radiation compose high-energy electromagnetic radiation. We classify different types of
radioactive decay by the radiation produced.
Figure 21.6 Alpha particles, which are attracted to the negative plate and deflected by a relatively small amount,
must be positively charged and relatively massive. Beta particles, which are attracted to the positive plate and
deflected a relatively large amount, must be negatively charged and relatively light. Gamma rays, which are
unaffected by the electric field, must be uncharged.
Alpha (α) decay is the emission of an α particle from the nucleus. For example, polonium-210 undergoes α decay:
84
210 Po ⟶ 2
4 He + 82
206 Pb or 84
210 Po ⟶ 2
4 α + 82
206 Pb
Alpha decay occurs primarily in heavy nuclei (A > 200, Z > 83). Because the loss of an α particle gives a daughter
nuclide with a mass number four units smaller and an atomic number two units smaller than those of the parent
nuclide, the daughter nuclide has a larger n:p ratio than the parent nuclide. If the parent nuclide undergoing α decay
lies below the band of stability (refer to Figure 21.2), the daughter nuclide will lie closer to the band.
Beta (β) decay is the emission of an electron from a nucleus. Iodine-131 is an example of a nuclide that undergoes β
decay:
53
131 I ⟶ -1
0 e + 54
131 Xe or 53
131 I ⟶ -1
0 β + 54
131 Xe
Beta decay, which can be thought of as the conversion of a neutron into a proton and a β particle, is observed in
nuclides with a large n:p ratio. The beta particle (electron) emitted is from the atomic nucleus and is not one of the
electrons surrounding the nucleus. Such nuclei lie above the band of stability. Emission of an electron does not change
the mass number of the nuclide but does increase the number of its protons and decrease the number of its neutrons.
Consequently, the n:p ratio is decreased, and the daughter nuclide lies closer to the band of stability than did the parent
nuclide.
Gamma emission (γ emission) is observed when a nuclide is formed in an excited state and then decays to its ground
state with the emission of a γ ray, a quantum of high-energy electromagnetic radiation. The presence of a nucleus in
an excited state is often indicated by an asterisk (*). Cobalt-60 emits γ radiation and is used in many applications
including cancer treatment:
27
60 Co* ⟶ 0
0 γ + 27
60 Co
There is no change in mass number or atomic number during the emission of a γ ray unless the γ emission
accompanies one of the other modes of decay.
Positron emission (β+ decay) is the emission of a positron from the nucleus. Oxygen-15 is an example of a nuclide
Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1139
that undergoes positron emission:
8
15 O ⟶ +1
0 e + 7
15 N or 8
15 O ⟶ +1
0 β + 7
15 N
Positron emission is observed for nuclides in which the n:p ratio is low. These nuclides lie below the band of stability.
Positron decay is the conversion of a proton into a neutron with the emission of a positron. The n:p ratio increases,
and the daughter nuclide lies closer to the band of stability than did the parent nuclide.
Electron capture occurs when one of the inner electrons in an atom is captured by the atom’s nucleus. For example,
potassium-40 undergoes electron capture:
19
40 K + -1
0 e ⟶ 18
40 Ar
Electron capture occurs when an inner shell electron combines with a proton and is converted into a neutron. The loss
of an inner shell electron leaves a vacancy that will be filled by one of the outer electrons. As the outer electron drops
into the vacancy, it will emit energy. In most cases, the energy emitted will be in the form of an X-ray. Like positron
emission, electron capture occurs for “proton-rich” nuclei that lie below the band of stability. Electron capture has the
same effect on the nucleus as does positron emission: The atomic number is decreased by one and the mass number
does not change. This increases the n:p ratio, and the daughter nuclide lies closer to the band of stability than did the
parent nuclide. Whether electron capture or positron emission occurs is difficult to predict. The choice is primarily
due to kinetic factors, with the one requiring the smaller activation energy being the one more likely to occur.
Figure 21.7 summarizes these types of decay, along with their equations and changes in atomic and mass numbers.
Figure 21.7 This table summarizes the type, nuclear equation, representation, and any changes in the mass or
atomic numbers for various types of decay.

PET Scan
Positron emission tomography (PET) scans use radiation to diagnose and track health conditions and monitor
medical treatments by revealing how parts of a patient’s body function (Figure 21.8). To perform a PET scan,
a positron-emitting radioisotope is produced in a cyclotron and then attached to a substance that is used by
the part of the body being investigated. This “tagged” compound, or radiotracer, is then put into the patient
(injected via IV or breathed in as a gas), and how it is used by the tissue reveals how that organ or other area
of the body functions.
Figure 21.8 A PET scanner (a) uses radiation to provide an image of how part of a patient’s body functions.
The scans it produces can be used to image a healthy brain (b) or can be used for diagnosing medical
conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (c). (credit a: modification of work by Jens Maus)
For example, F-18 is produced by proton bombardment of 18O ( 8
18 O + 1
1 p ⟶ 9
18 F + 0
1 n) and incorporated
into a glucose analog called fludeoxyglucose (FDG). How FDG is used by the body provides critical diagnostic
information; for example, since cancers use glucose differently than normal tissues, FDG can reveal cancers.
The 18F emits positrons that interact with nearby electrons, producing a burst of gamma radiation. This energy
is detected by the scanner and converted into a detailed, three-dimensional, color image that shows how that
part of the patient’s body functions. Different levels of gamma radiation produce different amounts of brightness
and colors in the image, which can then be interpreted by a radiologist to reveal what is going on. PET scans
can detect heart damage and heart disease, help diagnose Alzheimer’s disease, indicate the part of a brain
that is affected by epilepsy, reveal cancer, show what stage it is, and how much it has spread, and whether
treatments are effective. Unlike magnetic resonance imaging and X-rays, which only show how something
looks, the big advantage of PET scans is that they show how something functions. PET scans are now usually
performed in conjunction with a computed tomography scan.
Radioactive Decay Series
The naturally occurring radioactive isotopes of the heaviest elements fall into chains of successive disintegrations, or
decays, and all the species in one chain constitute a radioactive family, or radioactive decay series. Three of these
series include most of the naturally radioactive elements of the periodic table. They are the uranium series, the actinide
series, and the thorium series. The neptunium series is a fourth series, which is no longer significant on the earth
because of the short half-lives of the species involved. Each series is characterized by a parent (first member) that has
a long half-life and a series of daughter nuclides that ultimately lead to a stable end-product—that is, a nuclide on the
band of stability (Figure 21.9). In all three series, the end-product is a stable isotope of lead. The neptunium series,
previously thought to terminate with bismuth-209, terminates with thallium-205.
Chemistry in Everyday Life
Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1141
Figure 21.9 Uranium-238 undergoes a radioactive decay series consisting of 14 separate steps before producing
stable lead-206. This series consists of eight α decays and six β decays.
Radioactive Half-Lives
Radioactive decay follows first-order kinetics. Since first-order reactions have already been covered in detail in
the kinetics chapter, we will now apply those concepts to nuclear decay reactions. Each radioactive nuclide has a
characteristic, constant half-life (t1/2), the time required for half of the atoms in a sample to decay. An isotope’s half-
life allows us to determine how long a sample of a useful isotope will be available, and how long a sample of an
undesirable or dangerous isotope must be stored before it decays to a low-enough radiation level that is no longer a
problem.
For example, cobalt-60, an isotope that emits gamma rays used to treat cancer, has a half-life of 5.27 years (Figure
21.10). In a given cobalt-60 source, since half of the 27
60 Co nuclei decay every 5.27 years, both the amount of
material and the intensity of the radiation emitted is cut in half every 5.27 years. (Note that for a given substance, the
intensity of radiation that it produces is directly proportional to the rate of decay of the substance and the amount of
the substance.) This is as expected for a process following first-order kinetics. Thus, a cobalt-60 source that is used
for cancer treatment must be replaced regularly to continue to be effective.

Since nuclear decay follows first-order kinetics, we can adapt the mathematical relationships used for first-order
chemical reactions. We generally substitute the number of nuclei, N, for the concentration. If the rate is stated in
nuclear decays per second, we refer to it as the activity of the radioactive sample. The rate for radioactive decay is:
decay rate = λN with λ = the decay constant for the particular radioisotope
The decay constant, λ, which is the same as a rate constant discussed in the kinetics chapter. It is possible to express
the decay constant in terms of the half-life, t1/2:
λ = ln 2
t1/2 = 0.693
t1/2 or t1/2 = ln 2
λ = 0.693
λ
The first-order equations relating amount, N, and time are:
Nt = N0 e−kt or t = − 1
λ ln ⎛
⎝Nt
N0
⎞
⎠
where N0 is the initial number of nuclei or moles of the isotope, and Nt is the number of nuclei/moles remaining at
time t. Example 21.5 applies these calculations to find the rates of radioactive decay for specific nuclides.

Radon-222, 86
222 Rn, has a half-life of 3.823 days. How long will it take a sample of radon-222 with a mass
of 0.750 g to decay into other elements, leaving only 0.100 g of radon-222?
Answer: 11.1 days
Because each nuclide has a specific number of nucleons, a particular balance of repulsion and attraction, and its
own degree of stability, the half-lives of radioactive nuclides vary widely. For example: the half-life of 83
209 Bi is 1.9
× 1019 years; 94
239 Ra is 24,000 years; 86
222 Rn is 3.82 days; and element-111 (Rg for roentgenium) is 1.5 × 10–3
seconds. The half-lives of a number of radioactive isotopes important to medicine are shown in Table 21.2, and
others are listed in Appendix M.

Radiometric Dating
Several radioisotopes have half-lives and other properties that make them useful for purposes of “dating” the origin
of objects such as archaeological artifacts, formerly living organisms, or geological formations. This process is
radiometric dating and has been responsible for many breakthrough scientific discoveries about the geological

radiation to rid themselves of excess energy and become (more) stable.

history of the earth, the evolution of life, and the history of human civilization. We will explore some of the most
common types of radioactive dating and how the particular isotopes work for each type.
Radioactive Dating Using Carbon-14
The radioactivity of carbon-14 provides a method for dating objects that were a part of a living organism. This
method of radiometric dating, which is also called radiocarbon dating or carbon-14 dating, is accurate for dating
carbon-containing substances that are up to about 30,000 years old, and can provide reasonably accurate dates up to
a maximum of about 50,000 years old.
Naturally occurring carbon consists of three isotopes: 6
12 C, which constitutes about 99% of the carbon on earth;
6
13 C, about 1% of the total; and trace amounts of 6
14 C. Carbon-14 forms in the upper atmosphere by the reaction of
nitrogen atoms with neutrons from cosmic rays in space:
7
14 N + 0
1 n ⟶ 6
14 C + 1
1 H
All isotopes of carbon react with oxygen to produce CO2 molecules. The ratio of 6
14 CO2 to 6
12 CO2 depends on the
ratio of 6
14 CO to 6
12 CO in the atmosphere. The natural abundance of 6
14 CO in the atmosphere is approximately 1
part per trillion; until recently, this has generally been constant over time, as seen is gas samples found trapped in ice.
The incorporation of 6
14 C 6
14 CO2 and 6
12 CO2 into plants is a regular part of the photosynthesis process, which means
that the 6
14 C: 6
12 C ratio found in a living plant is the same as the 6
14 C: 6
12 C ratio in the atmosphere. But when the
plant dies, it no longer traps carbon through photosynthesis. Because 6
12 C is a stable isotope and does not undergo
radioactive decay, its concentration in the plant does not change. However, carbon-14 decays by β emission with a
half-life of 5730 years:
6
14 C ⟶ 7
12 N + -1
0 e
Thus, the 6
14 C: 6
12 C ratio gradually decreases after the plant dies. The decrease in the ratio with time provides a
measure of the time that has elapsed since the death of the plant (or other organism that ate the plant). Figure 21.11
visually depicts this process.
Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1145
Figure 21.11 Along with stable carbon-12, radioactive carbon-14 is taken in by plants and animals, and remains at a
constant level within them while they are alive. After death, the C-14 decays and the C-14:C-12 ratio in the remains
decreases. Comparing this ratio to the C-14:C-12 ratio in living organisms allows us to determine how long ago the
organism lived (and died).
For example, with the half-life of 6
14 C being 5730 years, if the 6
14 C: 6
12 C ratio in a wooden object found in an
archaeological dig is half what it is in a living tree, this indicates that the wooden object is 5730 years old. Highly
accurate determinations of 6
14 C: 6
12 C ratios can be obtained from very small samples (as little as a milligram) by the
use of a mass spectrometer.

Example 21.6
Radiocarbon Dating
A tiny piece of paper (produced from formerly living plant matter) taken from the Dead Sea Scrolls has
Link to Learning
1146 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
an activity of 10.8 disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon. If the initial C-14 activity was 13.6
disintegrations/min/g of C, estimate the age of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
Solution
The rate of decay (number of disintegrations/minute/gram of carbon) is proportional to the amount of
radioactive C-14 left in the paper, so we can substitute the rates for the amounts, N, in the relationship:
t = − 1
λ ln ⎛
⎝Nt
N0
⎞
⎠ ⟶ t = − 1
λ ln ⎛
⎝Ratet
Rate0
⎞
⎠
where the subscript 0 represents the time when the plants were cut to make the paper, and the subscript t
represents the current time.
The decay constant can be determined from the half-life of C-14, 5730 years:
λ = ln 2
t1/2 = 0.693
5730 y = 1.21 × 10−4 y−1
Substituting and solving, we have:
t = − 1
λ ln ⎛
⎝ Ratet
Rate0
⎞
⎠ = − 1
1.21 × 10−4 y−1 ln ⎛
⎝ 10.8 dis/min/g C
13.6 dis/min/g C
⎞
⎠ = 1910 y
Therefore, the Dead Sea Scrolls are approximately 1900 years old (Figure 21.12).
Figure 21.12 Carbon-14 dating has shown that these pages from the Dead Sea Scrolls were written or
copied on paper made from plants that died between 100 BC and AD 50.

More accurate dates of the reigns of ancient Egyptian pharaohs have been determined recently using plants
that were preserved in their tombs. Samples of seeds and plant matter from King Tutankhamun’s tomb have
a C-14 decay rate of 9.07 disintegrations/min/g of C. How long ago did King Tut’s reign come to an end?
Answer: about 3350 years ago, or approximately 1340 BC
There have been some significant, well-documented changes to the 6
14 C: 6
12 C ratio. The accuracy of a
straightforward application of this technique depends on the 6
14 C: 6
12 C ratio in a living plant being the same now as
it was in an earlier era, but this is not always valid. Due to the increasing accumulation of CO2 molecules (largely
6
12 CO2⎞
⎠ in the atmosphere caused by combustion of fossil fuels (in which essentially all of the 6
14 C has decayed),
the ratio of 6
14 C: 6
12 C in the atmosphere may be changing. This manmade increase in 6
12 CO2 in the atmosphere
causes the 6
14 C: 6
12 C ratio to decrease, and this in turn affects the ratio in currently living organisms on the earth.
Fortunately, however, we can use other data, such as tree dating via examination of annual growth rings, to calculate
correction factors. With these correction factors, accurate dates can be determined. In general, radioactive dating only
works for about 10 half-lives; therefore, the limit for carbon-14 dating is about 57,000 years.
Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1147
Radioactive Dating Using Nuclides Other than Carbon-14
Radioactive dating can also use other radioactive nuclides with longer half-lives to date older events. For example,
uranium-238 (which decays in a series of steps into lead-206) can be used for establishing the age of rocks (and the
approximate age of the oldest rocks on earth). Since U-238 has a half-life of 4.5 billion years, it takes that amount
of time for half of the original U-238 to decay into Pb-206. In a sample of rock that does not contain appreciable
amounts of Pb-208, the most abundant isotope of lead, we can assume that lead was not present when the rock was
formed. Therefore, by measuring and analyzing the ratio of U-238:Pb-206, we can determine the age of the rock.
This assumes that all of the lead-206 present came from the decay of uranium-238. If there is additional lead-206
present, which is indicated by the presence of other lead isotopes in the sample, it is necessary to make an adjustment.
Potassium-argon dating uses a similar method. K-40 decays by positron emission and electron capture to form Ar-40
with a half-life of 1.25 billion years. If a rock sample is crushed and the amount of Ar-40 gas that escapes is measured,
determination of the Ar-40:K-40 ratio yields the age of the rock. Other methods, such as rubidium-strontium dating
(Rb-87 decays into Sr-87 with a half-life of 48.8 billion years), operate on the same principle. To estimate the lower
limit for the earth’s age, scientists determine the age of various rocks and minerals, making the assumption that the
earth is older than the oldest rocks and minerals in its crust. As of 2014, the oldest known rocks on earth are the Jack
Hills zircons from Australia, found by uranium-lead dating to be almost 4.4 billion years old.
Example 21.7
Radioactive Dating of Rocks
An igneous rock contains 9.58 × 10–5 g of U-238 and 2.51 × 10–5 g of Pb-206, and much, much smaller
amounts of Pb-208. Determine the approximate time at which the rock formed.
Solution
The sample of rock contains very little Pb-208, the most common isotope of lead, so we can safely assume
that all the Pb-206 in the rock was produced by the radioactive decay of U-238. When the rock formed, it
contained all of the U-238 currently in it, plus some U-238 that has since undergone radioactive decay.
The amount of U-238 currently in the rock is:
9.58 × 10−5 g U × ⎛
⎝
⎜ 1 mol U
238 g U
⎞
⎠
⎟ = 4.03 × 10−7 mol U
Because when one mole of U-238 decays, it produces one mole of Pb-206, the amount of U-238 that has
undergone radioactive decay since the rock was formed is:
2.51 × 10−5 g Pb × ⎛
⎝
⎜ 1 mol Pb
206 g Pb
⎞
⎠
⎟ × ⎛
⎝ 1 mol U
1 mol Pb
⎞
⎠ = 1.22 × 10−7 mol U
The total amount of U-238 originally present in the rock is therefore:
4.03 × 10−7 mol + 1.22 × 10−7 mol = 5.25 × 10−7 mol U
The amount of time that has passed since the formation of the rock is given by:
t = − 1
λ ln ⎛
⎝ Nt
N0
⎞
⎠
with N0 representing the original amount of U-238 and Nt representing the present amount of U-238.
U-238 decays into Pb-206 with a half-life of 4.5 × 109 y, so the decay constant λ is:
λ = ln 2
t1/2 = 0.693
4.5 × 109 y = 1.54 × 10−10 y−1
Substituting and solving, we have:
1148 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry

t = − 1
1.54 × 10−10 y−1 ln ⎛
⎝4.03 × 10−7 mol U
5.25 × 10−7 mol U
⎞
⎠ = 1.7 × 109 y
Therefore, the rock is approximately 1.7 billion years old.

21.4 Transmutation and Nuclear Energy
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the synthesis of transuranium nuclides
• Explain nuclear fission and fusion processes
• Relate the concepts of critical mass and nuclear chain reactions
• Summarize basic requirements for nuclear fission and fusion reactors
After the discovery of radioactivity, the field of nuclear chemistry was created and developed rapidly during the early
twentieth century. A slew of new discoveries in the 1930s and 1940s, along with World War II, combined to usher in
the Nuclear Age in the mid-twentieth century. Scientists learned how to create new substances, and certain isotopes of
certain elements were found to possess the capacity to produce unprecedented amounts of energy, with the potential
to cause tremendous damage during war, as well as produce enormous amounts of power for society’s needs during
peace.
Synthesis of Nuclides
Nuclear transmutation is the conversion of one nuclide into another. It can occur by the radioactive decay of
a nucleus, or the reaction of a nucleus with another particle. The first manmade nucleus was produced in Ernest
Rutherford’s laboratory in 1919 by a transmutation reaction, the bombardment of one type of nuclei with other
nuclei or with neutrons. Rutherford bombarded nitrogen atoms with high-speed α particles from a natural radioactive
isotope of radium and observed protons resulting from the reaction:
7
14 N + 2
4 He ⟶ 8
17 O + 1
1 H
The 8
17 O and 1
1 H nuclei that are produced are stable, so no further (nuclear) changes occur.
To reach the kinetic energies necessary to produce transmutation reactions, devices called particle accelerators are
used. These devices use magnetic and electric fields to increase the speeds of nuclear particles. In all accelerators,
the particles move in a vacuum to avoid collisions with gas molecules. When neutrons are required for transmutation
reactions, they are usually obtained from radioactive decay reactions or from various nuclear reactions occurring in
nuclear reactors. The Chemistry in Everyday Life feature that follows discusses a famous particle accelerator that
made worldwide news.
Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1149
CERN Particle Accelerator
Located near Geneva, the CERN (“Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire,” or European Council
for Nuclear Research) Laboratory is the world’s premier center for the investigations of the fundamental
particles that make up matter. It contains the 27-kilometer (17 mile) long, circular Large Hadron Collider
(LHC), the largest particle accelerator in the world (Figure 21.13). In the LHC, particles are boosted to high
energies and are then made to collide with each other or with stationary targets at nearly the speed of light.
Superconducting electromagnets are used to produce a strong magnetic field that guides the particles around
the ring. Specialized, purpose-built detectors observe and record the results of these collisions, which are then
analyzed by CERN scientists using powerful computers.
Figure 21.13 A small section of the LHC is shown with workers traveling along it. (credit: Christophe
Delaere)
In 2012, CERN announced that experiments at the LHC showed the first observations of the Higgs boson,
an elementary particle that helps explain the origin of mass in fundamental particles. This long-anticipated
discovery made worldwide news and resulted in the awarding of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics to François
Englert and Peter Higgs, who had predicted the existence of this particle almost 50 years previously.
Famous physicist Brian Cox talks about his work on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, providing an

Prior to 1940, the heaviest-known element was uranium, whose atomic number is 92. Now, many artificial elements
have been synthesized and isolated, including several on such a large scale that they have had a profound effect
on society. One of these—element 93, neptunium (Np)—was first made in 1940 by McMillan and Abelson by
bombarding uranium-238 with neutrons. The reaction creates unstable uranium-239, with a half-life of 23.5 minutes,

which then decays into neptunium-239. Neptunium-239 is also radioactive, with a half-life of 2.36 days, and it decays
into plutonium-239. The nuclear reactions are:
92
238 U + 0

93
239 Np ⟶ 94
239 Pu + −1
0 e half-life = 2.36 days
Plutonium is now mostly formed in nuclear reactors as a byproduct during the decay of uranium. Some of the neutrons
that are released during U-235 decay combine with U-238 nuclei to form uranium-239; this undergoes β decay to
form neptunium-239, which in turn undergoes β decay to form plutonium-239 as illustrated in the preceding three
equations. It is possible to summarize these equations as:
92
238 U + 0
1 n ⟶ 92
239 U →⎯⎯⎯
β−
93
239 Np →⎯⎯⎯
β−
94
239 Pu
Heavier isotopes of plutonium—Pu-240, Pu-241, and Pu-242—are also produced when lighter plutonium nuclei
capture neutrons. Some of this highly radioactive plutonium is used to produce military weapons, and the rest presents
a serious storage problem because they have half-lives from thousands to hundreds of thousands of years.
Although they have not been prepared in the same quantity as plutonium, many other synthetic nuclei have been
produced. Nuclear medicine has developed from the ability to convert atoms of one type into other types of atoms.
Radioactive isotopes of several dozen elements are currently used for medical applications. The radiation produced
by their decay is used to image or treat various organs or portions of the body, among other uses.
The elements beyond element 92 (uranium) are called transuranium elements. As of this writing, 22 transuranium
elements have been produced and officially recognized by IUPAC; several other elements have formation claims that
are waiting for approval. Some of these elements are shown in Table 21.3.

Nuclear Fission
Many heavier elements with smaller binding energies per nucleon can decompose into more stable elements that have
intermediate mass numbers and larger binding energies per nucleon—that is, mass numbers and binding energies per
nucleon that are closer to the “peak” of the binding energy graph near 56 (see Figure 21.3). Sometimes neutrons are
also produced. This decomposition is called fission, the breaking of a large nucleus into smaller pieces. The breaking
is rather random with the formation of a large number of different products. Fission usually does not occur naturally,
but is induced by bombardment with neutrons. The first reported nuclear fission occurred in 1939 when three German
scientists, Lise Meitner, Otto Hahn, and Fritz Strassman, bombarded uranium-235 atoms with slow-moving neutrons
that split the U-238 nuclei into smaller fragments that consisted of several neutrons and elements near the middle of
the periodic table. Since then, fission has been observed in many other isotopes, including most actinide isotopes that
have an odd number of neutrons. A typical nuclear fission reaction is shown in Figure 21.14.
Figure 21.14 When a slow neutron hits a fissionable U-235 nucleus, it is absorbed and forms an unstable U-236
nucleus. The U-236 nucleus then rapidly breaks apart into two smaller nuclei (in this case, Ba-141 and Kr-92) along
with several neutrons (usually two or three), and releases a very large amount of energy.
Among the products of Meitner, Hahn, and Strassman’s fission reaction were barium, krypton, lanthanum, and
cerium, all of which have nuclei that are more stable than uranium-235. Since then, hundreds of different isotopes
have been observed among the products of fissionable substances. A few of the many reactions that occur for U-235,
and a graph showing the distribution of its fission products and their yields, are shown in Figure 21.15. Similar
fission reactions have been observed with other uranium isotopes, as well as with a variety of other isotopes such as
those of plutonium.

Figure 21.15 (a) Nuclear fission of U-235 produces a range of fission products. (b) The larger fission products of
U-235 are typically one isotope with a mass number around 85–105, and another isotope with a mass number that is
about 50% larger, that is, about 130–150.
View this link (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/16fission) to see a simulation of nuclear fission.
A tremendous amount of energy is produced by the fission of heavy elements. For instance, when one mole of U-235
undergoes fission, the products weigh about 0.2 grams less than the reactants; this “lost” mass is converted into a very
large amount of energy, about 1.8 × 1010 kJ per mole of U-235. Nuclear fission reactions produce incredibly large
amounts of energy compared to chemical reactions. The fission of 1 kilogram of uranium-235, for example, produces
about 2.5 million times as much energy as is produced by burning 1 kilogram of coal.
As described earlier, when undergoing fission U-235 produces two “medium-sized” nuclei, and two or three neutrons.
These neutrons may then cause the fission of other uranium-235 atoms, which in turn provide more neutrons that can
cause fission of even more nuclei, and so on. If this occurs, we have a nuclear chain reaction (see Figure 21.16).
On the other hand, if too many neutrons escape the bulk material without interacting with a nucleus, then no chain
reaction will occur.

Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1153
Figure 21.16 The fission of a large nucleus, such as U-235, produces two or three neutrons, each of which is
capable of causing fission of another nucleus by the reactions shown. If this process continues, a nuclear chain
reaction occurs.
Material that can sustain a nuclear fission chain reaction is said to be fissile or fissionable. (Technically, fissile
material can undergo fission with neutrons of any energy, whereas fissionable material requires high-energy
neutrons.) Nuclear fission becomes self-sustaining when the number of neutrons produced by fission equals or
exceeds the number of neutrons absorbed by splitting nuclei plus the number that escape into the surroundings. The
amount of a fissionable material that will support a self-sustaining chain reaction is a critical mass. An amount of
fissionable material that cannot sustain a chain reaction is a subcritical mass. An amount of material in which there
is an increasing rate of fission is known as a supercritical mass. The critical mass depends on the type of material:

its purity, the temperature, the shape of the sample, and how the neutron reactions are controlled (Figure 21.17).
Figure 21.17 (a) In a subcritical mass, the fissile material is too small and allows too many neutrons to escape the
material, so a chain reaction does not occur. (b) In a critical mass, a large enough number of neutrons in the fissile
material induce fission to create a chain reaction.
An atomic bomb (Figure 21.18) contains several pounds of fissionable material, 92
235 U or 94
239 Pu, a source of
neutrons, and an explosive device for compressing it quickly into a small volume. When fissionable material is in
small pieces, the proportion of neutrons that escape through the relatively large surface area is great, and a chain
reaction does not take place. When the small pieces of fissionable material are brought together quickly to form
a body with a mass larger than the critical mass, the relative number of escaping neutrons decreases, and a chain
reaction and explosion result.
Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1155
Figure 21.18 (a) The nuclear fission bomb that destroyed Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, consisted of two subcritical
masses of U-235, where conventional explosives were used to fire one of the subcritical masses into the other,
creating the critical mass for the nuclear explosion. (b) The plutonium bomb that destroyed Nagasaki on August 9,
1945, consisted of a hollow sphere of plutonium that was rapidly compressed by conventional explosives. This led to
a concentration of plutonium in the center that was greater than the critical mass necessary for the nuclear explosion.
Fission Reactors
Chain reactions of fissionable materials can be controlled and sustained without an explosion in a nuclear reactor
(Figure 21.19). Any nuclear reactor that produces power via the fission of uranium or plutonium by bombardment
with neutrons must have at least five components: nuclear fuel consisting of fissionable material, a nuclear moderator,
reactor coolant, control rods, and a shield and containment system. We will discuss these components in greater detail
later in the section. The reactor works by separating the fissionable nuclear material such that a critical mass cannot
be formed, controlling both the flux and absorption of neutrons to allow shutting down the fission reactions. In a
nuclear reactor used for the production of electricity, the energy released by fission reactions is trapped as thermal
energy and used to boil water and produce steam. The steam is used to turn a turbine, which powers a generator for
the production of electricity.

uses a pressurized water reactor, one of a few different fission reactor designs in use around the world, to produce
electricity. Energy from the nuclear fission reactions in the core heats water in a closed, pressurized system. Heat
from this system produces steam that drives a turbine, which in turn produces electricity. (credit a: modification of

Nuclear Fuels
Nuclear fuel consists of a fissionable isotope, such as uranium-235, which must be present in sufficient quantity to
provide a self-sustaining chain reaction. In the United States, uranium ores contain from 0.05–0.3% of the uranium
oxide U3O8; the uranium in the ore is about 99.3% nonfissionable U-238 with only 0.7% fissionable U-235. Nuclear
reactors require a fuel with a higher concentration of U-235 than is found in nature; it is normally enriched to
have about 5% of uranium mass as U-235. At this concentration, it is not possible to achieve the supercritical mass
necessary for a nuclear explosion. Uranium can be enriched by gaseous diffusion (the only method currently used in
the US), using a gas centrifuge, or by laser separation.
In the gaseous diffusion enrichment plant where U-235 fuel is prepared, UF6 (uranium hexafluoride) gas at low
pressure moves through barriers that have holes just barely large enough for UF6 to pass through. The slightly
lighter 235UF6 molecules diffuse through the barrier slightly faster than the heavier 238UF6 molecules. This process
is repeated through hundreds of barriers, gradually increasing the concentration of 235UF6 to the level needed by the
nuclear reactor. The basis for this process, Graham’s law, is described in the chapter on gases. The enriched UF6 gas
is collected, cooled until it solidifies, and then taken to a fabrication facility where it is made into fuel assemblies.
Each fuel assembly consists of fuel rods that contain many thimble-sized, ceramic-encased, enriched uranium (usually
UO2) fuel pellets. Modern nuclear reactors may contain as many as 10 million fuel pellets. The amount of energy in
each of these pellets is equal to that in almost a ton of coal or 150 gallons of oil.
Nuclear Moderators
Neutrons produced by nuclear reactions move too fast to cause fission (refer back to Figure 21.17). They must first
be slowed to be absorbed by the fuel and produce additional nuclear reactions. A nuclear moderator is a substance
that slows the neutrons to a speed that is low enough to cause fission. Early reactors used high-purity graphite as a
moderator. Modern reactors in the US exclusively use heavy water (1
2 H2 O) or light water (ordinary H2O), whereas
Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1157
some reactors in other countries use other materials, such as carbon dioxide, beryllium, or graphite.
Reactor Coolants
A nuclear reactor coolant is used to carry the heat produced by the fission reaction to an external boiler and turbine,
where it is transformed into electricity. Two overlapping coolant loops are often used; this counteracts the transfer of
radioactivity from the reactor to the primary coolant loop. All nuclear power plants in the US use water as a coolant.
Other coolants include molten sodium, lead, a lead-bismuth mixture, or molten salts.
Control Rods
Nuclear reactors use control rods (Figure 21.20) to control the fission rate of the nuclear fuel by adjusting the
number of slow neutrons present to keep the rate of the chain reaction at a safe level. Control rods are made of boron,
cadmium, hafnium, or other elements that are able to absorb neutrons. Boron-10, for example, absorbs neutrons by a
reaction that produces lithium-7 and alpha particles:
5
10 B + 0
1 n ⟶ 3
7 Li + 2
4 He
When control rod assemblies are inserted into the fuel element in the reactor core, they absorb a larger fraction of
the slow neutrons, thereby slowing the rate of the fission reaction and decreasing the power produced. Conversely, if
the control rods are removed, fewer neutrons are absorbed, and the fission rate and energy production increase. In an
emergency, the chain reaction can be shut down by fully inserting all of the control rods into the nuclear core between
the fuel rods.

Shield and Containment System
During its operation, a nuclear reactor produces neutrons and other radiation. Even when shut down, the decay
products are radioactive. In addition, an operating reactor is thermally very hot, and high pressures result from the
circulation of water or another coolant through it. Thus, a reactor must withstand high temperatures and pressures, and
must protect operating personnel from the radiation. Reactors are equipped with a containment system (or shield)
that consists of three parts:
1. The reactor vessel, a steel shell that is 3–20-centimeters thick and, with the moderator, absorbs much of the
radiation produced by the reactor
2. A main shield of 1–3 meters of high-density concrete
3. A personnel shield of lighter materials that protects operators from γ rays and X-rays
In addition, reactors are often covered with a steel or concrete dome that is designed to contain any radioactive
materials might be released by a reactor accident.

Energy Institute on how nuclear reactors work.
Nuclear power plants are designed in such a way that they cannot form a supercritical mass of fissionable material
and therefore cannot create a nuclear explosion. But as history has shown, failures of systems and safeguards can
cause catastrophic accidents, including chemical explosions and nuclear meltdowns (damage to the reactor core from
overheating). The following Chemistry in Everyday Life feature explores three infamous meltdown incidents.
Nuclear Accidents
The importance of cooling and containment are amply illustrated by three major accidents that occurred with
the nuclear reactors at nuclear power generating stations in the United States (Three Mile Island), the former
Soviet Union (Chernobyl), and Japan (Fukushima).
In March 1979, the cooling system of the Unit 2 reactor at Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in
Pennsylvania failed, and the cooling water spilled from the reactor onto the floor of the containment building.
After the pumps stopped, the reactors overheated due to the high radioactive decay heat produced in the first
few days after the nuclear reactor shut down. The temperature of the core climbed to at least 2200 °C, and the
upper portion of the core began to melt. In addition, the zirconium alloy cladding of the fuel rods began to react
with steam and produced hydrogen:
Zr(s) + 2H2 O(g) ⟶ ZrO2(s) + 2H2(g)
The hydrogen accumulated in the confinement building, and it was feared that there was danger of an
explosion of the mixture of hydrogen and air in the building. Consequently, hydrogen gas and radioactive gases
(primarily krypton and xenon) were vented from the building. Within a week, cooling water circulation was
restored and the core began to cool. The plant was closed for nearly 10 years during the cleanup process.
Although zero discharge of radioactive material is desirable, the discharge of radioactive krypton and xenon,
such as occurred at the Three Mile Island plant, is among the most tolerable. These gases readily disperse
in the atmosphere and thus do not produce highly radioactive areas. Moreover, they are noble gases and are
not incorporated into plant and animal matter in the food chain. Effectively none of the heavy elements of the
core of the reactor were released into the environment, and no cleanup of the area outside of the containment
building was necessary (Figure 21.21).

reactor are seen on the left, whereas the separate Unit 1 reactor, unaffected by the accident, continues
generating power to this day (right). (b) President Jimmy Carter visited the Unit 2 control room a few days
after the accident in 1979.
Another major nuclear accident involving a reactor occurred in April 1986, at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power
Plant in Ukraine, which was still a part of the former Soviet Union. While operating at low power during an
unauthorized experiment with some of its safety devices shut off, one of the reactors at the plant became
unstable. Its chain reaction became uncontrollable and increased to a level far beyond what the reactor was
designed for. The steam pressure in the reactor rose to between 100 and 500 times the full power pressure
and ruptured the reactor. Because the reactor was not enclosed in a containment building, a large amount
of radioactive material spewed out, and additional fission products were released, as the graphite (carbon)
moderator of the core ignited and burned. The fire was controlled, but over 200 plant workers and firefighters
developed acute radiation sickness and at least 32 soon died from the effects of the radiation. It is predicted
that about 4000 more deaths will occur among emergency workers and former Chernobyl residents from
radiation-induced cancer and leukemia. The reactor has since been encapsulated in steel and concrete, a
now-decaying structure known as the sarcophagus. Almost 30 years later, significant radiation problems still
persist in the area, and Chernobyl largely remains a wasteland.
In 2011, the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan was badly damaged by a 9.0-magnitude
earthquake and resulting tsunami. Three reactors up and running at the time were shut down automatically,
and emergency generators came online to power electronics and coolant systems. However, the tsunami
quickly flooded the emergency generators and cut power to the pumps that circulated coolant water through
the reactors. High-temperature steam in the reactors reacted with zirconium alloy to produce hydrogen gas.
The gas escaped into the containment building, and the mixture of hydrogen and air exploded. Radioactive
material was released from the containment vessels as the result of deliberate venting to reduce the hydrogen
pressure, deliberate discharge of coolant water into the sea, and accidental or uncontrolled events.
An evacuation zone around the damaged plant extended over 12.4 miles away, and an estimated 200,000
people were evacuated from the area. All 48 of Japan’s nuclear power plants were subsequently shut down,
remaining shuttered as of December 2014. Since the disaster, public opinion has shifted from largely favoring
to largely opposing increasing the use of nuclear power plants, and a restart of Japan’s atomic energy program
is still stalled (Figure 21.22).

The energy produced by a reactor fueled with enriched uranium results from the fission of uranium as well as from
the fission of plutonium produced as the reactor operates. As discussed previously, the plutonium forms from the
combination of neutrons and the uranium in the fuel. In any nuclear reactor, only about 0.1% of the mass of the fuel is
converted into energy. The other 99.9% remains in the fuel rods as fission products and unused fuel. All of the fission
products absorb neutrons, and after a period of several months to a few years, depending on the reactor, the fission
products must be removed by changing the fuel rods. Otherwise, the concentration of these fission products would
increase and absorb more neutrons until the reactor could no longer operate.
Spent fuel rods contain a variety of products, consisting of unstable nuclei ranging in atomic number from 25 to
60, some transuranium elements, including plutonium and americium, and unreacted uranium isotopes. The unstable
nuclei and the transuranium isotopes give the spent fuel a dangerously high level of radioactivity. The long-lived
isotopes require thousands of years to decay to a safe level. The ultimate fate of the nuclear reactor as a significant
source of energy in the United States probably rests on whether or not a politically and scientifically satisfactory
technique for processing and storing the components of spent fuel rods can be developed.

Nuclear Fusion and Fusion Reactors
The process of converting very light nuclei into heavier nuclei is also accompanied by the conversion of mass into
large amounts of energy, a process called fusion. The principal source of energy in the sun is a net fusion reaction in
which four hydrogen nuclei fuse and produce one helium nucleus and two positrons. This is a net reaction of a more
complicated series of events:
41
1 H ⟶ 2
4 He + 2+1
0
A helium nucleus has a mass that is 0.7% less than that of four hydrogen nuclei; this lost mass is converted into

energy during the fusion. This reaction produces about 3.6 × 1011 kJ of energy per mole of 2
4 He produced. This is
somewhat larger than the energy produced by the nuclear fission of one mole of U-235 (1.8 × 1010 kJ), and over 3
million times larger than the energy produced by the (chemical) combustion of one mole of octane (5471 kJ).
It has been determined that the nuclei of the heavy isotopes of hydrogen, a deuteron, 1
2 and a triton, 1
3, undergo
fusion at extremely high temperatures (thermonuclear fusion). They form a helium nucleus and a neutron:
1
2 H + 1
3 H ⟶ 2
4 He + 20
1 n
This change proceeds with a mass loss of 0.0188 amu, corresponding to the release of 1.69 × 109 kilojoules per mole
of 2
4 He formed. The very high temperature is necessary to give the nuclei enough kinetic energy to overcome the
very strong repulsive forces resulting from the positive charges on their nuclei so they can collide.
Useful fusion reactions require very high temperatures for their initiation—about 15,000,000 K or more. At these
temperatures, all molecules dissociate into atoms, and the atoms ionize, forming plasma. These conditions occur in
an extremely large number of locations throughout the universe—stars are powered by fusion. Humans have already
figured out how to create temperatures high enough to achieve fusion on a large scale in thermonuclear weapons.
A thermonuclear weapon such as a hydrogen bomb contains a nuclear fission bomb that, when exploded, gives off
enough energy to produce the extremely high temperatures necessary for fusion to occur.
Another much more beneficial way to create fusion reactions is in a fusion reactor, a nuclear reactor in which fusion
reactions of light nuclei are controlled. Because no solid materials are stable at such high temperatures, mechanical
devices cannot contain the plasma in which fusion reactions occur. Two techniques to contain plasma at the density
and temperature necessary for a fusion reaction are currently the focus of intensive research efforts: containment by
a magnetic field and by the use of focused laser beams (Figure 21.23). A number of large projects are working to
attain one of the biggest goals in science: getting hydrogen fuel to ignite and produce more energy than the amount
supplied to achieve the extremely high temperatures and pressures that are required for fusion. At the time of this
writing, there are no self-sustaining fusion reactors operating in the world, although small-scale controlled fusion
reactions have been run for very brief periods.
Figure 21.23 (a) This model is of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) reactor. Currently
under construction in the south of France with an expected completion date of 2027, the ITER will be the world’s
largest experimental Tokamak nuclear fusion reactor with a goal of achieving large-scale sustained energy
production. (b) In 2012, the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory briefly produced over
500,000,000,000 watts (500 terawatts, or 500 TW) of peak power and delivered 1,850,000 joules (1.85 MJ) of energy,
the largest laser energy ever produced and 1000 times the power usage of the entire United States in any given
moment. Although lasting only a few billionths of a second, the 192 lasers attained the conditions needed for nuclear
fusion ignition. This image shows the target prior to the laser shot. (credit a: modification of work by Stephan Mosel)

21.5 Uses of Radioisotopes
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• List common applications of radioactive isotopes
Radioactive isotopes have the same chemical properties as stable isotopes of the same element, but they emit
radiation, which can be detected. If we replace one (or more) atom(s) with radioisotope(s) in a compound, we
can track them by monitoring their radioactive emissions. This type of compound is called a radioactive tracer
(or radioactive label). Radioisotopes are used to follow the paths of biochemical reactions or to determine how a
substance is distributed within an organism. Radioactive tracers are also used in many medical applications, including
both diagnosis and treatment. They are used to measure engine wear, analyze the geological formation around oil
wells, and much more.
Radioisotopes have revolutionized medical practice (see Appendix M), where they are used extensively. Over 10
million nuclear medicine procedures and more than 100 million nuclear medicine tests are performed annually in the
United States. Four typical examples of radioactive tracers used in medicine are technetium-99 (43
99 Tc) , thallium-201
( 81
201 Tl) , iodine-131 ( 53
131 I) , and sodium-24 (11
24 Na) . Damaged tissues in the heart, liver, and lungs absorb certain
compounds of technetium-99 preferentially. After it is injected, the location of the technetium compound, and hence
the damaged tissue, can be determined by detecting the γ rays emitted by the Tc-99 isotope. Thallium-201 (Figure
21.24) becomes concentrated in healthy heart tissue, so the two isotopes, Tc-99 and Tl-201, are used together to study
heart tissue. Iodine-131 concentrates in the thyroid gland, the liver, and some parts of the brain. It can therefore be
used to monitor goiter and treat thyroid conditions, such as Grave’s disease, as well as liver and brain tumors. Salt
solutions containing compounds of sodium-24 are injected into the bloodstream to help locate obstructions to the flow
of blood.
Figure 21.24 Administering thallium-201 to a patient and subsequently performing a stress test offer medical
professionals an opportunity to visually analyze heart function and blood flow. (credit: modification of work by
“Blue0ctane”/Wikimedia Commons)
Radioisotopes used in medicine typically have short half-lives—for example, the ubiquitous Tc-99m has a half-life of
1164 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
6.01 hours. This makes Tc-99m essentially impossible to store and prohibitively expensive to transport, so it is made
on-site instead. Hospitals and other medical facilities use Mo-99 (which is primarily extracted from U-235 fission
products) to generate Tc-99. Mo-99 undergoes β decay with a half-life of 66 hours, and the Tc-99 is then chemically
extracted (Figure 21.25). The parent nuclide Mo-99 is part of a molybdate ion, MoO4 2−; when it decays, it
forms the pertechnetate ion, TcO 4 −. These two water-soluble ions are separated by column chromatography, with
the higher charge molybdate ion adsorbing onto the alumina in the column, and the lower charge pertechnetate ion
passing through the column in the solution. A few micrograms of Mo-99 can produce enough Tc-99 to perform as
many as 10,000 tests.
Figure 21.25 (a) The first Tc-99m generator (circa 1958) is used to separate Tc-99 from Mo-99. The MoO4 2− is
retained by the matrix in the column, whereas the TcO 4 − passes through and is collected. (b) Tc-99 was used in
this scan of the neck of a patient with Grave’s disease. The scan shows the location of high concentrations of Tc-99.

Radioisotopes can also be used, typically in higher doses than as a tracer, as treatment. Radiation therapy is the use
of high-energy radiation to damage the DNA of cancer cells, which kills them or keeps them from dividing (Figure
21.26). A cancer patient may receive external beam radiation therapy delivered by a machine outside the body, or
internal radiation therapy (brachytherapy) from a radioactive substance that has been introduced into the body.
Note that chemotherapy is similar to internal radiation therapy in that the cancer treatment is injected into the body,
but differs in that chemotherapy uses chemical rather than radioactive substances to kill the cancer cells.
Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1165
Figure 21.26 The cartoon in (a) shows a cobalt-60 machine used in the treatment of cancer. The diagram in (b)
shows how the gantry of the Co-60 machine swings through an arc, focusing radiation on the targeted region (tumor)
and minimizing the amount of radiation that passes through nearby regions.
Cobalt-60 is a synthetic radioisotope produced by the neutron activation of Co-59, which then undergoes β decay to
form Ni-60, along with the emission of γ radiation. The overall process is:
27
59 Co + 0
1 n ⟶ 27
60 Co ⟶ 28
60 Ni + −1
0 β + 20
0 γ
The overall decay scheme for this is shown graphically in Figure 21.27.

Figure 21.27 Co-60 undergoes a series of radioactive decays. The γ emissions are used for radiation therapy.
Radioisotopes are used in diverse ways to study the mechanisms of chemical reactions in plants and animals. These
include labeling fertilizers in studies of nutrient uptake by plants and crop growth, investigations of digestive and
milk-producing processes in cows, and studies on the growth and metabolism of animals and plants.
For example, the radioisotope C-14 was used to elucidate the details of how photosynthesis occurs. The overall
reaction is:
6CO2(g) + 6H2 O(l) ⟶ C6 H12 O6(s) + 6O2(g),
but the process is much more complex, proceeding through a series of steps in which various organic compounds are
produced. In studies of the pathway of this reaction, plants were exposed to CO2 containing a high concentration of
6
14 C . At regular intervals, the plants were analyzed to determine which organic compounds contained carbon-14 and
how much of each compound was present. From the time sequence in which the compounds appeared and the amount
of each present at given time intervals, scientists learned more about the pathway of the reaction.
Commercial applications of radioactive materials are equally diverse (Figure 21.28). They include determining the
thickness of films and thin metal sheets by exploiting the penetration power of various types of radiation. Flaws in
metals used for structural purposes can be detected using high-energy gamma rays from cobalt-60 in a fashion similar
to the way X-rays are used to examine the human body. In one form of pest control, flies are controlled by sterilizing
male flies with γ radiation so that females breeding with them do not produce offspring. Many foods are preserved by
radiation that kills microorganisms that cause the foods to spoil.

Americium-241, an α emitter with a half-life of 458 years, is used in tiny amounts in ionization-type smoke detectors
(Figure 21.29). The α emissions from Am-241 ionize the air between two electrode plates in the ionizing chamber.
A battery supplies a potential that causes movement of the ions, thus creating a small electric current. When smoke
enters the chamber, the movement of the ions is impeded, reducing the conductivity of the air. This causes a marked
drop in the current, triggering an alarm.

21.6 Biological Effects of Radiation
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• Describe the biological impact of ionizing radiation
• Define units for measuring radiation exposure
• Explain the operation of common tools for detecting radioactivity
• List common sources of radiation exposure in the US
The increased use of radioisotopes has led to increased concerns over the effects of these materials on biological
systems (such as humans). All radioactive nuclides emit high-energy particles or electromagnetic waves. When
this radiation encounters living cells, it can cause heating, break chemical bonds, or ionize molecules. The most
serious biological damage results when these radioactive emissions fragment or ionize molecules. For example,
alpha and beta particles emitted from nuclear decay reactions possess much higher energies than ordinary chemical
bond energies. When these particles strike and penetrate matter, they produce ions and molecular fragments that are
extremely reactive. The damage this does to biomolecules in living organisms can cause serious malfunctions in
normal cell processes, taxing the organism’s repair mechanisms and possibly causing illness or even death (Figure
21.30).
Figure 21.30 Radiation can harm biological systems by damaging the DNA of cells. If this damage is not properly
repaired, the cells may divide in an uncontrolled manner and cause cancer.
Ionizing and Nonionizing Radiation
There is a large difference in the magnitude of the biological effects of nonionizing radiation (for example, light and
microwaves) and ionizing radiation, emissions energetic enough to knock electrons out of molecules (for example,
α and β particles, γ rays, X-rays, and high-energy ultraviolet radiation) (Figure 21.31).
Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1169
Figure 21.31 Lower frequency, lower-energy electromagnetic radiation is nonionizing, and higher frequency, higher-
energy electromagnetic radiation is ionizing.
Energy absorbed from nonionizing radiation speeds up the movement of atoms and molecules, which is equivalent to
heating the sample. Although biological systems are sensitive to heat (as we might know from touching a hot stove
or spending a day at the beach in the sun), a large amount of nonionizing radiation is necessary before dangerous
levels are reached. Ionizing radiation, however, may cause much more severe damage by breaking bonds or removing
electrons in biological molecules, disrupting their structure and function. The damage can also be done indirectly, by
first ionizing H2O (the most abundant molecule in living organisms), which forms a H2O+ ion that reacts with water,
forming a hydronium ion and a hydroxyl radical:
Because the hydroxyl radical has an unpaired electron, it is highly reactive. (This is true of any substance with
unpaired electrons, known as a free radical.) This hydroxyl radical can react with all kinds of biological molecules
(DNA, proteins, enzymes, and so on), causing damage to the molecules and disrupting physiological processes.
Examples of direct and indirect damage are shown in Figure 21.32.
1170 Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col26069/1.5
Figure 21.32 Ionizing radiation can (a) directly damage a biomolecule by ionizing it or breaking its bonds, or (b)
create an H2O+ ion, which reacts with H2O to form a hydroxyl radical, which in turn reacts with the biomolecule,
causing damage indirectly.
Biological Effects of Exposure to Radiation
Radiation can harm either the whole body (somatic damage) or eggs and sperm (genetic damage). Its effects are more
pronounced in cells that reproduce rapidly, such as the stomach lining, hair follicles, bone marrow, and embryos. This
is why patients undergoing radiation therapy often feel nauseous or sick to their stomach, lose hair, have bone aches,
and so on, and why particular care must be taken when undergoing radiation therapy during pregnancy.
Different types of radiation have differing abilities to pass through material (Figure 21.33). A very thin barrier, such
as a sheet or two of paper, or the top layer of skin cells, usually stops alpha particles. Because of this, alpha particle
sources are usually not dangerous if outside the body, but are quite hazardous if ingested or inhaled (see the Chemistry
in Everyday Life feature on Radon Exposure). Beta particles will pass through a hand, or a thin layer of material like
paper or wood, but are stopped by a thin layer of metal. Gamma radiation is very penetrating and can pass through
a thick layer of most materials. Some high-energy gamma radiation is able to pass through a few feet of concrete.
Certain dense, high atomic number elements (such as lead) can effectively attenuate gamma radiation with thinner
material and are used for shielding. The ability of various kinds of emissions to cause ionization varies greatly, and
some particles have almost no tendency to produce ionization. Alpha particles have about twice the ionizing power
of fast-moving neutrons, about 10 times that of β particles, and about 20 times that of γ rays and X-rays.
Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1171
Figure 21.33 The ability of different types of radiation to pass through material is shown. From least to most
penetrating, they are alpha < beta < neutron < gamma.
Radon Exposure
For many people, one of the largest sources of exposure to radiation is from radon gas (Rn-222). Radon-222
is an α emitter with a half–life of 3.82 days. It is one of the products of the radioactive decay series of U-238
(Figure 21.9), which is found in trace amounts in soil and rocks. The radon gas that is produced slowly escapes
from the ground and gradually seeps into homes and other structures above. Since it is about eight times more
dense than air, radon gas accumulates in basements and lower floors, and slowly diffuses throughout buildings
(Figure 21.34).

Figure 21.34 Radon-222 seeps into houses and other buildings from rocks that contain uranium-238, a
radon emitter. The radon enters through cracks in concrete foundations and basement floors, stone or porous
cinderblock foundations, and openings for water and gas pipes.
Radon is found in buildings across the country, with amounts depending on where you live. The average
concentration of radon inside houses in the US (1.25 pCi/L) is about three times the levels found in outside
air, and about one in six houses have radon levels high enough that remediation efforts to reduce the radon
concentration are recommended. Exposure to radon increases one’s risk of getting cancer (especially lung
cancer), and high radon levels can be as bad for health as smoking a carton of cigarettes a day. Radon is the
number one cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers and the second leading cause of lung cancer overall. Radon
exposure is believed to cause over 20,000 deaths in the US per year.
Measuring Radiation Exposure
Several different devices are used to detect and measure radiation, including Geiger counters, scintillation counters
(scintillators), and radiation dosimeters (Figure 21.35). Probably the best-known radiation instrument, the Geiger
counter (also called the Geiger-Müller counter) detects and measures radiation. Radiation causes the ionization of the
gas in a Geiger-Müller tube. The rate of ionization is proportional to the amount of radiation. A scintillation counter
contains a scintillator—a material that emits light (luminesces) when excited by ionizing radiation—and a sensor that
converts the light into an electric signal. Radiation dosimeters also measure ionizing radiation and are often used
Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1173
to determine personal radiation exposure. Commonly used types are electronic, film badge, thermoluminescent, and
quartz fiber dosimeters.
Figure 21.35 Devices such as (a) Geiger counters, (b) scintillators, and (c) dosimeters can be used to measure
radiation. (credit c: modification of work by “osaMu”/Wikimedia commons)
A variety of units are used to measure various aspects of radiation (Figure 21.36). The SI unit for rate of radioactive
decay is the becquerel (Bq), with 1 Bq = 1 disintegration per second. The curie (Ci) and millicurie (mCi) are much
larger units and are frequently used in medicine (1 curie = 1 Ci = 3.7 × 1010 disintegrations per second). The SI
unit for measuring radiation dose is the gray (Gy), with 1 Gy = 1 J of energy absorbed per kilogram of tissue. In
medical applications, the radiation absorbed dose (rad) is more often used (1 rad = 0.01 Gy; 1 rad results in the
absorption of 0.01 J/kg of tissue). The SI unit measuring tissue damage caused by radiation is the sievert (Sv). This
takes into account both the energy and the biological effects of the type of radiation involved in the radiation dose.
The roentgen equivalent for man (rem) is the unit for radiation damage that is used most frequently in medicine
(100 rem = 1 Sv). Note that the tissue damage units (rem or Sv) includes the energy of the radiation dose (rad or Gy)
along with a biological factor referred to as the RBE (for relative biological effectiveness) that is an approximate
measure of the relative damage done by the radiation. These are related by:
number of rems = RBE × number of rads
with RBE approximately 10 for α radiation, 2(+) for protons and neutrons, and 1 for β and γ radiation.
Figure 21.36 Different units are used to measure the rate of emission from a radioactive source, the energy that is
absorbed from the source, and the amount of damage the absorbed radiation does.

Effects of Long-term Radiation Exposure on the Human Body
The effects of radiation depend on the type, energy, and location of the radiation source, and the length of exposure.
As shown in Figure 21.37, the average person is exposed to background radiation, including cosmic rays from the
sun and radon from uranium in the ground (see the Chemistry in Everyday Life feature on Radon Exposure); radiation
from medical exposure, including CAT scans, radioisotope tests, X-rays, and so on; and small amounts of radiation
from other human activities, such as airplane flights (which are bombarded by increased numbers of cosmic rays in
the upper atmosphere), radioactivity from consumer products, and a variety of radionuclides that enter our bodies
when we breathe (for example, carbon-14) or through the food chain (for example, potassium-40, strontium-90, and
iodine-131).
Figure 21.37 The total annual radiation exposure for a person in the US is about 620 mrem. The various sources
and their relative amounts are shown in this bar graph. (source: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission)

A short-term, sudden dose of a large amount of radiation can cause a wide range of health effects, from changes in
blood chemistry to death. Short-term exposure to tens of rems of radiation will likely cause very noticeable symptoms
or illness; a dose of about 500 rems is estimated to have a 50% probability of causing the death of the victim within 30
days of exposure. Exposure to radioactive emissions has a cumulative effect on the body during a person’s lifetime,
which is another reason why it is important to avoid any unnecessary exposure to radiation. Health effects of short-
term exposure to radiation are shown in Table 21.5.
Health Effects of Radiation[2]
Exposure (rem) Health Effect Time to Onset (without treatment)
5–10 changes in blood chemistry —
50 nausea hours
55 fatigue —
70 vomiting —
75 hair loss 2–3 weeks
90 diarrhea —
100 hemorrhage —
400 possible death within 2 months
1000 destruction of intestinal lining —
internal bleeding —
death 1–2 weeks
2000 damage to central nervous system —
loss of consciousness; minutes
death hours to days
Table 21.5
It is impossible to avoid some exposure to ionizing radiation. We are constantly exposed to background radiation from
a variety of natural sources, including cosmic radiation, rocks, medical procedures, consumer products, and even our
own atoms. We can minimize our exposure by blocking or shielding the radiation, moving farther from the source,
and limiting the time of exposure.

Summary
21.1 Nuclear Structure and Stability
An atomic nucleus consists of protons and neutrons, collectively called nucleons. Although protons repel each other,
the nucleus is held tightly together by a short-range, but very strong, force called the strong nuclear force. A nucleus
has less mass than the total mass of its constituent nucleons. This “missing” mass is the mass defect, which has been
converted into the binding energy that holds the nucleus together according to Einstein’s mass-energy equivalence
equation, E = mc2. Of the many nuclides that exist, only a small number are stable. Nuclides with even numbers of
protons or neutrons, or those with magic numbers of nucleons, are especially likely to be stable. These stable nuclides
occupy a narrow band of stability on a graph of number of protons versus number of neutrons. The binding energy
per nucleon is largest for the elements with mass numbers near 56; these are the most stable nuclei.
21.2 Nuclear Equations
Nuclei can undergo reactions that change their number of protons, number of neutrons, or energy state. Many
different particles can be involved in nuclear reactions. The most common are protons, neutrons, positrons (which
are positively charged electrons), alpha (α) particles (which are high-energy helium nuclei), beta (β) particles (which
are high-energy electrons), and gamma (γ) rays (which compose high-energy electromagnetic radiation). As with
chemical reactions, nuclear reactions are always balanced. When a nuclear reaction occurs, the total mass (number)
and the total charge remain unchanged.
21.3 Radioactive Decay
Nuclei that have unstable n:p ratios undergo spontaneous radioactive decay. The most common types of radioactivity
are α decay, β decay, γ emission, positron emission, and electron capture. Nuclear reactions also often involve
γ rays, and some nuclei decay by electron capture. Each of these modes of decay leads to the formation of a
new nucleus with a more stable n:p ratio. Some substances undergo radioactive decay series, proceeding through
multiple decays before ending in a stable isotope. All nuclear decay processes follow first-order kinetics, and each
radioisotope has its own characteristic half-life, the time that is required for half of its atoms to decay. Because of
the large differences in stability among nuclides, there is a very wide range of half-lives of radioactive substances.
Many of these substances have found useful applications in medical diagnosis and treatment, determining the age of
archaeological and geological objects, and more.
21.4 Transmutation and Nuclear Energy
It is possible to produce new atoms by bombarding other atoms with nuclei or high-speed particles. The products
of these transmutation reactions can be stable or radioactive. A number of artificial elements, including technetium,
astatine, and the transuranium elements, have been produced in this way.
Nuclear power as well as nuclear weapon detonations can be generated through fission (reactions in which a heavy
nucleus is split into two or more lighter nuclei and several neutrons). Because the neutrons may induce additional
fission reactions when they combine with other heavy nuclei, a chain reaction can result. Useful power is obtained if
the fission process is carried out in a nuclear reactor. The conversion of light nuclei into heavier nuclei (fusion) also
produces energy. At present, this energy has not been contained adequately and is too expensive to be feasible for
commercial energy production.
21.5 Uses of Radioisotopes
Compounds known as radioactive tracers can be used to follow reactions, track the distribution of a substance,
diagnose and treat medical conditions, and much more. Other radioactive substances are helpful for controlling pests,
visualizing structures, providing fire warnings, and for many other applications. Hundreds of millions of nuclear
Chapter 21 | Nuclear Chemistry 1181
medicine tests and procedures, using a wide variety of radioisotopes with relatively short half-lives, are performed
every year in the US. Most of these radioisotopes have relatively short half-lives; some are short enough that the
radioisotope must be made on-site at medical facilities. Radiation therapy uses high-energy radiation to kill cancer
cells by damaging their DNA. The radiation used for this treatment may be delivered externally or internally.
21.6 Biological Effects of Radiation
We are constantly exposed to radiation from a variety of naturally occurring and human-produced sources. This
radiation can affect living organisms. Ionizing radiation is the most harmful because it can ionize molecules or break
chemical bonds, which damages the molecule and causes malfunctions in cell processes. It can also create reactive
hydroxyl radicals that damage biological molecules and disrupt physiological processes. Radiation can cause somatic
or genetic damage, and is most harmful to rapidly reproducing cells. Types of radiation differ in their ability to
penetrate material and damage tissue, with alpha particles the least penetrating but potentially most damaging and
gamma rays the most penetrating.
Various devices, including Geiger counters, scintillators, and dosimeters, are used to detect and measure radiation, and
monitor radiation exposure. We use several units to measure radiation: becquerels or curies for rates of radioactive
decay; gray or rads for energy absorbed; and rems or sieverts for biological effects of radiation. Exposure to radiation
can cause a wide range of health effects, from minor to severe, and including death. We can minimize the effects of
radiation by shielding with dense materials such as lead, moving away from the source, and limiting time of exposure.

Exponential Arithmetic
Exponential notation is used to express very large and very small numbers as a product of two numbers. The first
number of the product, the digit term, is usually a number not less than 1 and not equal to or greater than 10. The
second number of the product, the exponential term, is written as 10 with an exponent. Some examples of exponential
notation are:
1000 = 1 × 103
100 = 1 × 102
10 = 1 × 101
1 = 1 × 100
0.1 = 1 × 10−1
0.001 = 1 × 10−3
2386 = 2.386 × 1000 = 2.386 × 103
0.123 = 1.23 × 0.1 = 1.23 × 10−1
The power (exponent) of 10 is equal to the number of places the decimal is shifted to give the digit number.
The exponential method is particularly useful notation for every large and very small numbers. For example,
1,230,000,000 = 1.23 × 109, and 0.00000000036 = 3.6 × 10−10.
Appendix B 1191
Addition of Exponentials
Convert all numbers to the same power of 10, add the digit terms of the numbers, and if appropriate, convert the digit
term back to a number between 1 and 10 by adjusting the exponential term.
Example B1
Adding Exponentials
Add 5.00 × 10−5 and 3.00 × 10−3.
Solution
3.00 × 10−3 = 300 × 10−5
(5.00 × 10−5) + (300 × 10−5) = 305 × 10−5 = 3.05 × 10−3
Subtraction of Exponentials
Convert all numbers to the same power of 10, take the difference of the digit terms, and if appropriate, convert the
digit term back to a number between 1 and 10 by adjusting the exponential term.
Example B2
Subtracting Exponentials
Subtract 4.0 × 10−7 from 5.0 × 10−6.
Solution
4.0 × 10−7 = 0.40 × 10−6
(5.0 × 10−6) − (0.40 × 10−6) = 4.6 × 10−6
Multiplication of Exponentials
Multiply the digit terms in the usual way and add the exponents of the exponential terms.
Example B3
Multiplying Exponentials
Multiply 4.2 × 10−8 by 2.0 × 103.
Solution
(4.2 × 10−8) × (2.0 × 103) = (4.2 × 2.0) × 10(−8) + (+3) = 8.4 × 10−5
1192 Appendix B

Division of Exponentials
Divide the digit term of the numerator by the digit term of the denominator and subtract the exponents of the
exponential terms.
Example B4
Dividing Exponentials
Divide 3.6 × 105 by 6.0 × 10−4.
Solution
3.6 × 10−5
6.0 × 10−4 = ⎛
⎝3.6
6.0
⎞
⎠ × 10(−5) − (−4) = 0.60 × 10−1 = 6.0 × 10−2
Squaring of Exponentials
Square the digit term in the usual way and multiply the exponent of the exponential term by 2.
Example B5
Squaring Exponentials
Square the number 4.0 × 10−6.
Solution
(4.0 × 10−6)2 = 4 × 4 × 102 × (−6) = 16 × 10−12 = 1.6 × 10−11
Cubing of Exponentials
Cube the digit term in the usual way and multiply the exponent of the exponential term by 3.
Example B6
Cubing Exponentials
Cube the number 2 × 104.
Solution
(2 × 104)3 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 103 × 4 = 8 × 1012
Taking Square Roots of Exponentials
If necessary, decrease or increase the exponential term so that the power of 10 is evenly divisible by 2. Extract the
square root of the digit term and divide the exponential term by 2.
Example B7
Finding the Square Root of Exponentials
Find the square root of 1.6 × 10−7.
Appendix B 1193
Solution
1.6 × 10−7 = 16 × 10−8
16 × 10−8 = 16 × 10−8 = 16 × 10− 8
2 = 4.0 × 10−4
Significant Figures
A beekeeper reports that he has 525,341 bees. The last three figures of the number are obviously inaccurate, for
during the time the keeper was counting the bees, some of them died and others hatched; this makes it quite difficult
to determine the exact number of bees. It would have been more reasonable if the beekeeper had reported the number
525,000. In other words, the last three figures are not significant, except to set the position of the decimal point. Their
exact values have no useful meaning in this situation. When reporting quantities, use only as many significant figures
as the accuracy of the measurement warrants.
The importance of significant figures lies in their application to fundamental computation. In addition and subtraction,
the sum or difference should contain as many digits to the right of the decimal as that in the least certain of the
numbers used in the computation (indicated by underscoring in the following example).
Example B8
Addition and Subtraction with Significant Figures
Add 4.383 g and 0.0023 g.
Solution
4.383_ g
0.0023_ g
4.385_ g
In multiplication and division, the product or quotient should contain no more digits than that in the factor containing
the least number of significant figures.
Example B9
Multiplication and Division with Significant Figures
Multiply 0.6238 by 6.6.
Solution
0.6238_ × 6.6_ = 4.1_
When rounding numbers, increase the retained digit by 1 if it is followed by a number larger than 5 (“round up”). Do
not change the retained digit if the digits that follow are less than 5 (“round down”). If the retained digit is followed
by 5, round up if the retained digit is odd, or round down if it is even (after rounding, the retained digit will thus
always be even).
The Use of Logarithms and Exponential Numbers
The common logarithm of a number (log) is the power to which 10 must be raised to equal that number. For example,
the common logarithm of 100 is 2, because 10 must be raised to the second power to equal 100. Additional examples
follow.

1 100 0
0.1 10−1 −1

Table B1
What is the common logarithm of 60? Because 60 lies between 10 and 100, which have logarithms of 1 and 2,
respectively, the logarithm of 60 is 1.7782; that is,
60 = 101.7782
The common logarithm of a number less than 1 has a negative value. The logarithm of 0.03918 is −1.4069, or
0.03918 = 10−1.4069 = 1
101.4069
To obtain the common logarithm of a number, use the log button on your calculator. To calculate a number from its
logarithm, take the inverse log of the logarithm, or calculate 10x (where x is the logarithm of the number).
The natural logarithm of a number (ln) is the power to which e must be raised to equal the number; e is the constant
2.7182818. For example, the natural logarithm of 10 is 2.303; that is,
10 = e2.303 = 2.71828182.303
To obtain the natural logarithm of a number, use the ln button on your calculator. To calculate a number from its
natural logarithm, enter the natural logarithm and take the inverse ln of the natural logarithm, or calculate ex (where x
is the natural logarithm of the number).
Logarithms are exponents; thus, operations involving logarithms follow the same rules as operations involving
exponents.
1. The logarithm of a product of two numbers is the sum of the logarithms of the two numbers.
log xy = log x + log y, and ln xy = ln x + ln y
2. The logarithm of the number resulting from the division of two numbers is the difference between the
logarithms of the two numbers.
log x
y = log x − log y, and ln x
y = ln x − ln y
3. The logarithm of a number raised to an exponent is the product of the exponent and the logarithm of the
number.
log xn = nlog x and ln xn = nln x
The Solution of Quadratic Equations
Mathematical functions of this form are known as second-order polynomials or, more commonly, quadratic functions.
ax2 + bx + c = 0
The solution or roots for any quadratic equation can be calculated using the following formula:
Appendix B 1195
x = −b ± b2 − 4ac
2a
Example B10
Solving Quadratic Equations
Solve the quadratic equation 3x2 + 13x − 10 = 0.
Solution
Substituting the values a = 3, b = 13, c = −10 in the formula, we obtain
x = −13 ± (13)2 − 4 × 3 × (−10)
2 × 3
x = −13 ± 169 + 120
6 = −13 ± 289
6 = −13 ± 17
6
The two roots are therefore
x = −13 + 17
6 = 2
3 and x = −13 − 17
6 = −5
Quadratic equations constructed on physical data always have real roots, and of these real roots, often only those
having positive values are of any significance.
Two-Dimensional (x-y) Graphing
The relationship between any two properties of a system can be represented graphically by a two-dimensional data
plot. Such a graph has two axes: a horizontal one corresponding to the independent variable, or the variable whose
value is being controlled (x), and a vertical axis corresponding to the dependent variable, or the variable whose value
is being observed or measured (y).
When the value of y is changing as a function of x (that is, different values of x correspond to different values of y),
a graph of this change can be plotted or sketched. The graph can be produced by using specific values for (x,y) data
pairs.

If the function that describes the dependence of y on x is known, it may be used to compute x,y data pairs that may
subsequently be plotted.

1. Acids and bases are commercially available as aqueous solutions. This table lists properties (densities and concentrations) of common
acid and base solutions. Nominal values are provided in cases where the manufacturer cites a range of concentrations and densities.
2. This column contains specific gravity data. In the case of this table, specific gravity is the ratio of density of a substance to the density of
pure water at the same conditions. Specific gravity is often cited on commercial labels.
3. This solution is sometimes called “ammonium hydroxide,” although this term is not chemically accurate.
